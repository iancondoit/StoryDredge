Washington, January 1.—Copies of 
what were declared to be communica- 
tions. between Japanese and French 
governments covering the proposal that 
the two governments act in concert 
at the Washington conference with 
réspect to the establishment of a Jap- 
anese protectorate over Siberia, were 
given out tonight by the special dele- 
ration of the Far Eastern republie 
of Chita which has asked for a hear- 
ing when the Siberian question is 
taken. up by the conference. 

The communications were characer- 
ized tonight by a member of the 
French delegation, as “forgeries, stu- 
a y contrived,” and-by a spokesman 

the Japanese delegation as “mali- 
cious fabrication.” 

“The Frengh government has had no. 
communication whatever with the Jap- 
ance government respecting a protec- 
torate over eastern Siberia,” said M. 
Kammerer, director of the Russian 
and Far Eastern department of the 
French foreign office. 

“Must Be Forgery.” 

“T have been vice foreign minister 
since September 8, 1919,” said M. 
Ilanihara, one of the Japanese dele- 
vates, “that-is to say, during the pe- 
riod when these alleged documents

Disclosing many changes in esti-

night, placed the total value. of im-

Among those not fully informed, there

the policy pursued by the board had 
the effect of lessening the blow rather 
than to accelerate it.

as we have done it before, especially 
when our government is convinced 
that with regard to all the questions 

which will be discussed in Washing: 
~ ton the French government will have 
to rely on Japan only. Our agree. 
ment with Japan on the Siberian ques- 
tion forces ys to be very careful, for 
our decisions are in conflict with the 
policy of America which is now play- 
jng an important part in the ,east. 
America’s; intention to secure for it- 
self a place in soviet Russia has been 
frustrated by our policy. The Amer- 
* ieans are .therefore, pushing the east- 
erp question so as to gain supremacy 
in the east. We must resist such 
efforts by all means and the French 
government hopes to haye the help 
of the Japanese government in that. 

“The Japanese plan to.create a free 
republic in the east under the pro- 


- ftectionship of Japan is cOmprehensi- | 


ble to us, and the French government 
will give its support to that plan by 
all means, especially as we believe 
that the Japanese government will 
.take into consideration our interests 
in the Chinese Kastern railway, Man- 
churia and our interests in conces: 
sions. We consider necessary, there- 
fore, to be well informed of all the de- 
tails of the Dairen conference so as to 
come to Washington sufficiently pre- 
jsired.. It would be advisable to 
send such a delegation which would 
be capable of working out all the de- 
tails. With regard we would advise 
you to consult our representative.

in Russia is reaching its end. A com- 
plete collapse can be expected at any 
time. There is no need of sending 
our troops against the bolsheviks, or 
# taking any other step. The chaos, 
the general situation,.eur attitude of 
expectation and the terrible famine 
have ruined Russia. The East will 
also be influenced by this crisis. The 
chaos will be extended to Siberia and 
in this respect we need the help of,

today in expressions of regret , over 
the death of Senator Bois Penrose, of 
Pennsylvania, for a quarter of a cen- 
tury an outstanding figure in repub- 
lican councils.

senator, but will forego other custo- 
A request of Sena- 
tor Penrose that his funeral should be 
private, and that no congressional 
committee should be appointed, was 
communicated teday to Vice President 
Coolidge and Speaker Gillett, and prob-

Senator Penrose’s body was taken 
this morning to his home at Philadel-

Charles B. Penrose, and the senator’s 
secretary. Funeral arrangements are 
to be made at Philadelphia. 

Committee to Meet. 

A special meeting of the senate_fi- 
mance committee is to be held tomor-

ing Senator Penrose, who had been its 
chairman for several years, and an in- 
fluential member of the committee for 
a generation. The Pennsylvania dele- 
gation in congress also is to meet for 
appropriate action. Capitol flags 
will fly at half-mast for thirty days, | 
and the late senator’s seat on the front! 
row of the senate chamber will be 
draped in mourning. 

The impress of Senator Penrose’s 
great force of character on legislative 
and political events was voiced general-

ties. :

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 1.—The arms 
conference begins the New Year with 
most of its membe looking toward # 
final adjournmeant two weeks hence. 
despite the prospect of having yet to 
clear away several troublesome is- 
sues. 

One of the American delegates -pre- 
dicted today that the five-power naval 
limitation treaty would be put into 
final form during the coming ‘week, 
and that in the week following a set- 
tlement would be effected covering the 
Far Eastern field. The same expecta- 
tion wes echoed in the foreign dele 
gations, most of whose members ai- 
ready have made definite plans to 
leave Washington about mid-January. 

A tendncy to press the negotia- 
tions to a conclusion, even if some of 
the original hopes for accomplishment 
have to go by the board, is evident 
now in many quarters. ‘The delegages 
are said to feel that seven weeks of 
discussion have quite fully developed 
the national viewpoints of all the 
powers, and that little is to be gain- 
ed now by prolonging debate ‘on points 
that have brought to light serious di- 
visions of opinien: 

Experts Work Hard. 

In pursuance of this policy, the naval 
experts who are ironing out details of 
the naval limitation plan, will disre- 
gard the new year’s holiday tomorrow 
dnd spend the day at work. None of 
them expect to find serious difficulty 
in the technical adjustments remain- 
ing to be formulated to. such 
questions as méthods of‘ replacement 
and scrapping, and there is a general 
feeling that the end of the week may

five-power treaty covering: the naval

“The disturbance in the Far East.” 
Mr. Borah continued, “and the things 
which threaten war arose out of 
failure of the nations now proposing 
an alliance to regard the rights of 
other nations, and not out of acts of 
those who are excluded from the al- 
liance. There would be no Far East- 


liance had respected the rights of the 
weak or more peacefully disposed 
peoples of, the «east. Let «the 


members will respect the rights and 
sovereignty and interests of other peo- 
ples, and let it be provided that if 
they do not the alliance is dissolved. 

“I think one of the most interest- 
ing and illuminating revealments of 
modern diplomacy is that proposition 
that the nations which have been 
doing all of the aggressing, or attack- 
‘ing. should get together and sotemnly 
form an alliance against those nations 
w.v have not been guilty of such 
things. If the nations which are to

credited to the French, that is, the

oblige themselves by that very fact 
even though tacitly to aid that one 
of themselves which should find itself 
at grips with & danger which ite lim- 
ited armament would not allow it to 
subdue. 

3. It ig not possible to have a 
contractng] limitation of armament 
without there being at the same time 
among all the contractants a joint and 
several obligations of mutual aid. 

Mr. Briand came here with his 
thoughts centered on France, her sac- 
rifices, her dangers; 1 don’t think it’s 
unfair to say that he was not think- 
ing much of the peace of the world. 
Self-absorbed, he found himself set 
at one side of the Washington con- 
ference, Tobe sure, he and his col- 
leagues wenf given a fosition at the 
left of the American delegates, Great 
Britain being at the right, but when 
Mr. Hughes presented his naval pro- 
gram, France did not figure in it. 
The whole discussion was centered on 
Great Britain, Japan, the United 
States. France and Iatly were set 
aside with the casual remark that it 
was not thought necessary to discuss 
their tonnage allowance at that time. 

France Kept in Background. 

Did Mr. Hughes lack a little in 
tact and understanding when ‘he con- 
fined his opening speech to three na- 
tions? I think that the after events 
point that way. To have invited 
eight nations here and'to have spoken 
to but two at the start was a good 
deal like inviting eight guests to a 


oo 


—_s 


-in the really tremen thin} 

| Mr. Hughes did. The trouble 
‘there is almost alwaygope amon 
number of neglected gu that 
feel’ it and does not forget it. 

‘The opening week of the- conference 
kept France in about the same posi- 
tion that she -had on the opening 
day. She was not yet a principal— 
and another point—and one that is 
bard on the #renen—they saw here 
what they ‘began w see in Paris in 
1919 and so openly resented théere— 
that English is taxing the place of 
French as the Janguage of diplomacy. 
There is no nijstaxe about this, and 
i don’t wonder that all Frenchmen 
resent it. At the vpening day every 
delegate except M. Briand, spoke in 
Engiish; the French transiations 
which follawed each | were 
made purely out of compliment to the 
French delegation. M. Briand is one 
of not a tew in France who will take 
no pains whatever to learn a word of 
Engtish, For the last two years he 
has been constantly in conferences with 
Lioyd-George, he bas had most of that 
time, the remarkable interpreter, M 
Garmlynck, who has so distinguished 
himself here, at his side. In all this 
time he has not learned a word of 
English, although Lioyd-George, Who 
at the start,-understood no French 
at all, is now able to follow closely 
the arguments in Ffench, and even 
will at times correct or question the 
paraning of the translation into Eng- 
ish. 


The French are not a race that con- 
ceal their feelings. An Englishman, 
an American, is apt to aecuse anybody 
who does not cover up disappointment 
or resentment, of being a poor sport. 
France’s chief contempt for the Anglo- 
Saxon is that he is not out and out 
with everything; that he has reti- 
cences and reserves, conceals his dis- 
likes, his vices, his emotions, The 
French showed that they were disap- 
pointed. ‘They did not mix freely; 
they did not use the ample offices 
prepared for them in the annex to the 
Pan-American. building, where the del-

Future Conference. 

Bound up in the submarine restric- 
tion plan also is the suggestion for a 
future conference to consider subma- 
rine and auxiliary limitations in a 
more definite way. President H£:- 
ding has been said to strongly favor 
such a conference, but there has 
been no evidence that any delegation 
was preparing formally to propose it. 
Some of the delegates are known to 
be taking the position that another 
meeting to talk over the, submarine 
problem would be useless unless the 
initiative in that direction were taken 
by France, whose announcement that 
she intended to reserve the right to 
nearly treble her present submarine 
strength brought te an end the Wash- 
ington negotiations for. submarine 
limitation. ‘ 
In that connection, all the delega- 
tions are watching developments at 
Cannes, where Premiers Lloyd-George. 
of Great Britain, and Briand, of 
France, are beginning a discussion 
which cable advices haye indicated 
might eventually get around to the 
submarine tangle. American Ambas- 
sador Harvey has gone to Cannes 
prepared to discuss the Washington 
submarine issue with the two pre- 
miers, if occasion offers and, in some 
quarters, important results are ex- 
pected.

The man in overalls and the wom- 
an in her: work dress were praised 
as influences contributing toward the 
world’s domestic and economic stabil- 
ity, in a talk by Congressman W. D. 
Upshaw at the New Year rally of 
workingmen and women held at the 
Baptist Tabernacle Sunday night. The 
occasion was the fourth anniversary 
of the pastorate of Rev. John W. 
Ham at the Tabernacle. .~ 

“More and more the world needs to 
learn the duty of crowning with its 
faith and favor, its loye and its fair- 
ness, the men and women who toil 
daily with their hands, and whose 
chief chattel. consises. of the horns 
of their hands and the sweat on their 
brows,” declared Mr. Upshaw. “The 
man in overalls has always been my 
hero—the woman at his side a gen- 
uine heroine in the world’s upbuild- 
ing. 

“Tf all interested parties would 
keep clear heads, and true hearts,” 
Mr. Upshaw continued, “there need 
never be another foolish clash between 
labor and capital. If capital would 
always remember that {t would have 
no dividends from its factories, no 
gold or coal from its mines, no rail- 
roads and nobody tv run the trains, 
and no counting houses even in which 
to manipulate the finances of earth, 
if it were not for the man In overalls; 
and if the man in overalls would al- 
ways remember that he would have 
had no job yesterday, that he would 
have none today, and that there would 
be no job at all tomorrow if it were 
not for the blessings of well directed 
capital—if both classes, I say, would 
remémber these fundamental facts and 
live toward each other according to 
these facts in the light of the Golden 
Rule of the Son of God and the Son 
of Man, there would never be another 
fierce battle between labor and capi- 
tal to disturb the prosperity and hap-

Atlanta Boy Scouts, under their 
scoutmasters and commissioners, dur- 
ing the year’ 1921, stood 10,714 exami- 
nations in scout work, which indicates 
that the Atlanta council is one of the 
most active in the United States, and 
which shows a marked increase over 
1920, as shown by the annual report 
of the council, just made public. The 
total increase of tests passed amount- 
ed to 3,945 over 1920, 

These examinations in each in- 
stance were stood by individual scouts 
who were working toward higher rank 
in the organization, and every test 
represents considerable study and ap- 
plication on the part of the scout. 

,District 1, under the direction of 
Commissioners A, L.* Myers, Willis 
M. Timms and George R. Donovan, is 
first among the four districts of the 
Atlanta council in the total number 
of tests passed during the year. Tlie 
total for district 1 reached the high- 
water .mark of 2,947. District 4 came 
second, with a total of 2,661 exami- 
nations passed; district 3, under the 
direction of A. R. Dyer and C. L. Dan- 
forth, was next with a total of 2.633, 
and district 2, with a total of 2,473 
came fourth. ) 

Sutton Gratified. 

Commissioner W. A. Sutten, of the 
Atlanta council, when asked his opin- 
ion of the record made by Atlanta 
scouts in advancement work during 
the past year, stated: 

“We feel confident that the record 
of examinations successfully passed 


| 


by Boy Scouts of A 
well above the av 
co s in the country. 


-of the scout 
The increase 


‘of approximately 4,000 examinations 


over 1920 is indicative of the growth 
and activity of scou in Atlanta, 
and well justifies the effort, time and 
interest of the fine group of men whe 
— heading the movement in our 
city. 

“I feel that credit for this remarka- 
ble showing is due to troop leaders, 
who have devoted so much effort to 
their work during the past twelve 
months. These men share largely in 
the credit that is due to tnoge Who are 
building for Atlanta sturdy, maegnifi- 
eent young manhood.” A 

Seout Executive A. A. Jameson 
states that while he considered the rec- 
ord a good one, it was his hope that 
during the year 1922 this record 
might be far surpassed. 


As a means of a closer co-operation 
between the Boy Scout council and 
the Carnegie library, Miss Barker, the 
librarian, has placed in circulation at 
the central library on Carnegie way,

were found on the front seat and on

The authorities were informed that 
several automohilists were stopped on

Athens, Ga.. January 1.—Relatives 
of A. P. Sexton, missing president of 
the Sexton Plant company, of Val-

hetter known in sporting circles as 
“Ianck Sheehan.” today secured from 


| Judge Rufus E. Foster, of the Unit- 


ed States district court here, an in- 
junction restraining rrohibition agents 
from removing liquor seized late last 
night in the basement of Boarsburg's 
private residence, and ordering that 
the guards placed there by Hugh 
Larre, federal prohibition enforcement 
agent, be withdrawn frem the prem-

No date has been set for a hear- 
ing of argument on the restraining 
order, but it was indicated it would 
be next Tuesday. 

Prohibition agents said that Boars- 
burg admitted to them that he had 
stored in his cellar $50,000 worth of 
assorted liquors that he purchased be- 
fore prohibition went into effect. 
When the agents visited his residence 
last night Boarsburg protested against 
them entering, saying they had no 
right to search it in the absence of 
some indication that he had violated 
the Volstead act. 

Mr. Larre’s assistants sat on the 
front steps of Boarsburg’s home while 
he went in search of Judge Foster to 
get advice before taking any steps to- 
ward seizing the liquor. After a can- 
ference with the judge Mr. Larre 
returned and took charge of the liquor, 
placing a guard over the cellar,

French concerning a Japanese policy 
toward Siberia. 


Prompt Denial. 


An unofficial commission sent to 
the conference by the Far WHastern 
republic @f Chita, Siberia, made oy 
lic the alleged secret agreements o 
the French and Japanese  govern- 
ments. ‘They were promptly denied 
by both the French and Japanese 
plenipotentiaries, who denounced the 
documentary evidence presented by 
the Far Eastern commisssion as con- 
stituting a “forgery’’ and “malicious 
falsehood.” 


Whether the accusation will come 
formally befere the arms conference 
is uncertain, since the Far Eastern 
representatives not only are not mem- 
bers of the conférence, but are speak- 
ing for an unrecognized government. 
The Siberian situation, however, is 
on the agenda for the Far Eastern dis- 
cussions, and when it is taken up for 
consideration the Chinese or some 
other delegation may inject the Far 
Pastern charges into the formal nego- 
tiations, 

If a plenary session is held this 
week, it is not impossible that its 
program may include ratification of 
some clarifying instrument’ to define 
the scope of the four-power Pacific 
treaty with reference to the principal 
Japanese islands. Negotiations for 
such a clarification are proceeding. 
the Americans having given assurances 
that they will not oppose a Japanese 
plan to declare that the treaty does 
not cover the Japanese “homeland.” 
The present disenssions are said to 
be tending toward accomplishment of 
that end through a reservation signed 
by all the four powers. 

Opponents Busy. 

While this exchange is in progress 
the opponents of :the treaty in the 
senate are busy organizing to prevent 
its ratification and are losing no or 
portunity to carry their fight to the 
country. Senator Rorah, republic- 
an, Tdaho, delivered from the it 
in Washimeton today an argument 
against unreserved ratification, and his 
sneech was disseminated from the cap- 
ital by wireless. More. discnasion ‘of 
the subject in the senate itself is er- 
pected when it reconvenes this week 
after the holiday recegs.. 

On the side of the naval limitation 
nrogram. the most embarrassing prob- 
lem yet to be settled is that involved 
in the proposed regulation of aubma-

BODY CARRIED 
TO PHILADELPHIA. 


Philadelphia, Pa., January 1.—The 
hody of United States Senator Boies 
Penrose, who died in Washington in 
the final hour of the old year, was 
brought to his - batchelor home in 
Spruce street here today, in keeping 
with the oft-expressed wish of the late 
political leader. The family is plan- 
ning to hold the funeral as privately 
as circumstances will permit. To- 
night no time had been fixed for the 
interment., Dr. Charles B. Penrose, 
ene of the senator’s brothers, is await- 
ing definite word from Spencer Pen- 
rose, of Colorado, another brother, 
before making final arrangements. It 
was said that some members of the 
family desire the funeral held without 
any previous announcement. 

The body of Senator Penrose was 
accompanied by Leighton C. Taylor, 
his principal secretary, and the two 
nurses who had attended the senator 
at Washington. It was removed 
from the train at the West Philadel- 
phia station. Tonight the body of 
the senior senator rested in his big 
old-fashioned house under conditions 
somewhat similar to the life he led 
while there—virtually alone. The 
only occupant was a faithful old house- 
keeper. No crepe was displayed on 
the front door. 

The death of the senator, a great 
shock to the legion of political friends 
in Philadelphia and throughout the 
state, was not entirely unexpected by 
those who knew his real condition. Al- 
ways active in the state and national 
councils of the party, he chafed under 
his long illness and took upon himselt 
more than his physicians desired him 
to. He, however, took no active part 
in the last municipal campaign in) 
November, giving as a reason his 
finance committee duties jn the sen- 
ate. 

Expressions of regret at the sen- 
ator’s death came from men promt- 
nent in the republican and democratic 

rties of city, state and nation, and 
rom men in many professions and in 
civic life of the city. ll expres- 
sions of sympathy sent to the family 
were withheld from the public in keep- 
ing with the late senator's wish.

INDIAN REPUBLIC 
NOW PROGLAIMED 


_ Washington, January 1.—India has 
been proclaimed a republic and the 
non-violence policy cf Mahatma Ghan- 
di, who was given dictatorial powers 
last week by the all-India national 
congress, has been modified to per- 
mit violence “for defense,” in a ca- 
blegram received today by Sailendra 
N. Ghose, director of the. American 
commission to promote self-govern- 
ment in India. As a further measure 
of obstruction against British govern- 
ment, the message said, the existing 
boycott has been extended to indi- 
viduals. 

The message to the American com- 
mission, as given out tonight, was as 
follows: 

“Republic declared. American mes- 
sage decided. Armed defense sanc- 
tioned. Boycott extended to indi- 
viduals. Women and children safe.” 

“The American message,” referred 
to, was said to be that signed by 
Senators Norris, of Nebraska, and 
Walsh, of Massachusetts, and a num- 
ber of other prominent publicists and 
jurists. pledging American support 
to the Indian “campaign for inde- 
pendence,” 

“Proclamation of the republic of 


the pledge which was sent to the na- 
tionalists of India by a group of lib- 
erty-loving Americans,” Ghose said in 
a statement tonight. “That pledge 
was read in a meeting of the all- 
India national congress and that 
the All-India Moslem league, Simul- 
taneously it. was posted throughout 
India, both in English and the dialect 
of the district in which it appeared. 
, . It is permissible to announce 
now that, in preparation for the decla- 
ration of independence, provisional 
government has been organized in all 
the provinces. A central government 
has been formed with’ Ghandi at its 
head, which means that as long as 
Britain remains there will be a state 
within a state.” 


The French parliament has empow- 
ered the government to acquire the | 
potash mines of Alsace for their sys- 
tematic development in the national 
interests.

With the sale in the past few'days of a quarter of a million bags 
of old crop Cuban raw sugars for January apd February shipment at 
1 3-4 cents a pound cost and freight, the lowest price at which such 
sugars have sold in nearly 20 years, sugar refiners in New York as 
well as along the Atlantic seaboard reduced prices for granulated 
sugar another 10 to 20 points, establishing the wholesale selling price 
at 4.90 cents generally, with one refinery at Yonkers, N. Y., accepting 
business a few days ago at as low as 4.80 cents less 2 per cent for 
cash. At these prices sugar is selling well below the actual cost of 
production, and European buyers have already taken advantage of 
the situation by placing large orders in the United States for refined 
Sugar for delivery over the first quarter of 1922. 


Needn’t Be Afraid of Money---No Bacteria\There 


There seems to be little basis for the belief that coins bear any 
close relation to the spread of disease, according to an, announcement 
made at the University of Illinois by high officials, following a series 
of tests made by them. 

“Coins of the lower denominations were examined for the types 
of bacteria which exist on them,” says their report. “It has often been 
stated that money is a very dangerous’ article of commerce since it 
if handled by all sorts of persons and beeause it usually moves.so 
quickly from one person to another. It has also been stated that 
cashiers and others whose vocations require them to handle moncy 
in larger quantities than the average\person, might be more suscep- 


tibe to disease, but this does not seem“o be the case. 

It seems that the very metals from which the coins are made act 
to destroy the bacteria which reach the coins. 
more resistant of bacteria, the spore-forming bacteria, were found.’ 
This indicates that money need not be feared for bacteria cannot live

Bird-Potts Co., Inc., 

Is Well Equipped in 
New ‘Welding Building’ 


Looking forward to a splendid re- 
vival of business all along the line. 
and especially as its own business 
may be effected, the Bird-Potts com- 
pany, Inc., of this cify, has just 


~*~ 


“ equipped its new business home with 


all that is modern and up to the min- 
ute, and seems to be fully justified in 
its anticipatien of'a good year. Many 
of their old p toatl so officials of 
the company say, who have been closed 
down for awhile, are now preparing to 
reopen, which means additional work 
for the welders. 

The Bird-Potts company are per- 
haps the oldest welders in the south. 
The company has recently moved into 
its new building, which is known as 
the “Welding building,” located at 
376-378 Marietta street. Since occu- 
pying this new home it has branched 
out in new lines to cover the automo- 
bile industry more thoroughly. Its 
principal business has been electric 
welding, oxy-acetylene welding and 
selling General Electric company elec- 
tric welding machines. Practically all 
automobile dealers and repairers have 
become convinced that ‘they do not 
have enough work in welding, radiator, 
body and fender work, to keep first- 
class men employed at all times, so 
to take up this work, which requires 
specialists, the Bird-votts Company, 
Ine., have incorporated all these de-

In addition to its automobile depart- 
ment, the company does a general line 
of welding, such as metal tanks of 
all descriptions. At this time it is in- 
stalling a semi-automatie electric are 
welder, that will very materially add 


This will be the first machine of this 
kind that has come in the south. 

The company finds on its outside 
work that many people are realizing 
that they must begin to get their 
broken machinery and worn machinery 
in shape. This department is receiv- 
ing many calls from all over’ the 
south. Recently the company had 
shipped into its plant from different 
parts of the south, several carloads of 
machinery to be welded, and where 
parts are too bulky to ship. the eom- 
pany has been sending out portable 
machines to the work, working in this 
way over the entire south. 

The new plant is equipped with 
traveling cranes, so that army class 
of work can be hauled quickly and 
economically. Carload shipments come 
in on its own siding, so by this ar- 
rangement are avoided all heavy truck- 
age charges. 

“Our electric department,” said an 
official the other day, “is equipped 
with four electric are welders, and an 
eautomatic welder, which will be in-| 
stalled early in the new year. Our

Taylor Tire Co. 


Takes Agency for ; 
Well-Known Tire 


The Taylor Tire company, of this 
city, has recently taken on the agency 
‘for the American Akron tire, a very 
high-grade tire manufactured by the 
American Rubber and Tire company, 
of Akron, Ohio. 

J. R. Harris, who is the southern 
distributing agent for the big tire con- 
cern, is making his headquarters at 
the office of the Taylor Tire compi*y, 

8 West Peachtree street. In av@i- 
tion to a large stock of these populd? 
tires, ranging in size from 28x3 to 
40x38, the company also cafries a cem- 
plete line of auto accessories. 

In speaking of their new tire com 
nection, one of the officials of the 
Taylor company said: 

“We guarantee all pneumatic auto- 
mobile tires bearing the name and se- 
rial number of the Ameritan ‘Tire 
and Rubber company to be free frotn 
imperfections in material and work- 
manship. - Tires returned for cBnsid- 
eration under this guarantee will be 
accepted only when all transportation 
charges are paid. If, upon examina- 
tion, it is our judgment that tires are 
defective, they will be repaired or re- 
placed at our option. 

“When tires are replaced by us, 
charge will be made to owners at the 
time new tires are delivered for such 
amounts as in our judgment will com- 
pensate for the service rendered by 
such replaced tires.” 


oxy-acetylene department is equipped 
with four oxy-acetylene welding and 
cutting machines; all other depart- 
ments are,equipped with the latest de- 
vices to give good work and. prompt 
service, which undoubtedly gives us 
the most complete welding establish- 
ment in the south. In fact, there is 
none more complete anywhere. 

“We are closing the year 1921 with 
a clean bill of health, thanking our 


old customers for their patronage and |- 


good will of our wark and service, and 
pleased with the many new customers 
that have come to us the past year. 
As members of the American Welding 
society, we keep in touch with the 
welding developments all over. this 
country, and are safe in saying that 
the year 1921 has been the best in 
the welding industry, for the Ameri- 
can Welding society is doing much to 
make every weld a good weld. This be- 
ing an infant industry, it has required 
much time and attention to develop 
ways and means to put the welding 
industry on a safe and sane basis, and 
through the efforts of the American 
Welding society this is becoming a fact 
more and more every day. Today 
many things are saved and put back 
to work that were ate 5 thrown 
in ,the scrap pile.” . /

CUBA AND THE TARIFF. 

On behalf of various economic 
associations of Cuba which recent- 
ly ‘staged a monster public dem- 
enstration in Havana intended to 
arouse public sentiment against the 
enactment of the sugar and tobacco 
schedules of the Fordney tariff bill, 
a written appeal has been directed 
to the Cuban president, urging him 
to officially request the congress 
of the United States to strike the 
objectionable items from the meas- 
ure under consideration. 

The address is an_ eloquent, 
forceful and logical document pre- 
pared by M. Arango, president of 
the Association of Sugar Produc- 
ers and Cane Growers of Cuba, and 
presented to Cuban chief executive 
at the time of the recent monster 


Havana; and it is predicated upon 
the theory that if the ‘sugar and 
tobacco industries are compelled to 
pay the import duties contemplated 
by the Fordney bill, the result 
would be ruinous to them and a 
disastrous shock to Cuban develop- 
ment. 

It calls atioution to the peculiar 
relationship that exists between 
the United States and Cuba, this 


position’ of god-father, guardian 
and protector of the smaller re- 
public; and it argues the incongrui- 


ing a tariff barrier which, instead 


‘would entirely paralyze our 
industrial life.’ “e4 3 

Furthermore, the address sets 
forth that “about 65 per cent” of

burden upon its own nationals, and, 


i 
“It is difficult to understand why 
economic interests of Cuba,

versity and struggling against aj}, 
world-wide crisis.” 


The president of 


Cuba is re-/|' 
quested to— ? 


“let the honorable president of the 
United States know, in order that 
he may persist in his friendly at. 
titude toward us, ana ditso the 
American congress and the diplo- 
matic representatives of the United 
States in Cuba, that if the Fordney 
bill is enacted without modifica*ion 
as respects Cuba, the ruin of a 
people, distant but four hours by 
sea and one by air from. their | 
shores, will have been decreed.” 

He is asked to remind the Amer- 
ican government of the liberal at- 
titude of the late Presidents Mc- 
Kinley and Roosevelt, and of vari- 
ous other outstanding contempora- 
neous American statesmen who- 
were and are friendly to Cuba and 
interested in her welfare; and the 
appeal calls particular attention to 
the following statement. that was 
made by Elihu Root while -secre- | 
tary of state under President. 
Roosevelt: | 

“The propserity of Cuba depends 
upon finding a market for her prin- 
cipal products, sugar and tobacco, 
at a reasonable profit. Under exist- 
ing conditions,’ or any conditions* 
which are to be anticipated, she can 
find such a market for her sugar, 
and to a great degree for her tobac- 
co, only in the United States. 

“Our present duty to Cuba can 
be performed by the making of sych | 
a reciprocal tariff arrangement 
with her as Pregident McKinie) 
urged in his last words to his coun- 
trymen at Buffalo on the 5th ot 
September. A reasonable reduction

DOCTORS DISAGREE. 
Several weeks ago the Journal

naire asking them to state their 
opinion as to the value of whisky,

In its issue of December 24 the 
medical journal makes public, in 
tabulated: form, the results of the 
canvass in Illinois and Indiana, the 
first two states from which com- 
plete returns are available. 

Of the 3,063 Illinois and Indiana 
doctors who replied to the ques- 
tionnaire 1,552 declared they. “do 
not regard whisky as a necessary 
therapeutic agent in 4ne practice of

The real friends of Eugene Debs, and 
the eonservative socialistic element in 
| Washington—and it is strong, for the 
' capitol of the nation jis a hot- of 
radicalism—deplore their leader’s atti- 
tude since his liberation from the At- 
lanta prison. 

In the first place it was a serious | 
mistake of somebody,. either. in the 
white hoyse or, the department of jus- 
tice, to have Debs come to Washing- 
ton after his” release on a commuta- 
tion of Sentence. 

Just what good’ it could do to’ bring 
him here’ into the very center of ‘world 
publicity, with the eyes of the politi- 
call correspondents of every large news- 

r.on the globe upon him at one 
time; and to parade” spud the

COUMEFY——* 2, 

Well; it ig just one of a inex- 
plicable things that ‘Happen, wreynout 
rhyme, reason or good. wetiae, ~ 

And then, in tarn, just why Debs, 
not restored to citizenship, and an old 
man of experience, should: ave fallen 
so easy for the noisy setitiment of 
emotional sympathizers,: and should 
have been beguiled by the flatteries 
that ‘are too often ) upon 
those who have been puni&hed for ile- 
deeds, is another inexplicable | thing— 

For'in Washington Debs courted 
the notoriety’ he got, and courted it 


with the daring. spirit of a defiant ex- 


mar Sea Y 
Washington, January 1.—/(Special.). | 


tremist—courted it-with @ flag of red, 
in substance, ‘swinging frém: his shoul- 
der. | 

Thousands of people who flocked to 
see him, and to block his passage on 
the streets, and in the terminals, not 
only in Washington but in his home 
city of Terre Haute, were curiosity 
seekers, of course. But Debs’ atti- 
tude .has been that of the’ conquering 


tle front— 
And just as sure as two and two 
are four Eugene Debs has been made, 


anf 


him, the .foremost. radical of 
the nation, gnd a dangerous factor in 
Amerita's #ational life., : 

It is no fault of President Harding 
that he was given a commutation of 


sentence. -¢ 

Indeed, he-acted right; but the 
fault is first in Debs himself—who 
has sadly disappointed his wisest 
friends—and secondly in that individ- 
ual.of administrative authority who 
brought him to Washington and placed 
him on a pedestal of world-wide pub- 
licity. 

Unwittingly it was the greatest 
piece of socialistic propagandering the 


w vorid has ever knows.

The I. O:.C.. is a. bi-partigan board. 
There are equal numbers of members 


from the: two major parties. The 
southeast. has no. representation on 


it, and it had ‘been hoped that the. 


president: would give’>.the available 
democratic appointment to that sec- 
tion. . 

The president: thought the same way 
about it; and thinks so’ yet, so.1 am 
reliably -Informed. ._ Such pressure, 
however, was pn to bear for the 
-renaming. of the men jn office that 
the president felt -he could not with- 
stand it, particularly as no. know 
reason could be advanced, except sec- 
tional, fer the failure. to reappoint 
them. He felt, I am, told, that. if 
one -of.. 
avere dropped without reason both 
would have-to be dropped. : 

‘The fact remains, however, that for 
several days he had -before him the 
unusually strong endorsements of Mr. 
Perry,, coming not alone fvom the 
southeast, but from all over the United 
States, and he considered very seriaus-

without. the knowledge of the former. 
A great unany of these were from re- 
publicans in republican states. 

It’ is safe to predict that if the 
president @s again called upon by 
death or resignation, or for other rea- 
sons, to appoint a democrat to this

Announcement: has not been made 
from the office of the commissioner of 


internal revenue that tax assesments 
made against the Lincoln Motor com- 
of Detroit, would be reduced 


By this error the credit of the com- 
pany, with eleven subsidiary corpora- 
tions scattered throughout the coun- 
try, and. capitalized at approximately 
$12,000,000, was so greatly impaired 
that it could not weather the storm, 
and the bankruptcy proceedings in sev- 
eral. states followed. i 

Now, the error is regretted, of 


course. But ‘that doesn’t repair the

about. 

Your thinking place is like a heat-

Farmer Williams : 
Has a Unique View, 
"To Say the Least of I 


—— 


Editor .Constitution: The only 
thing you see now is advice to the 
farmer to grow more foodstuffs, 
abandon the all-cotton idea, diversi- 


4 fy, make lots of everything to eat— 


plenty of corn, cane, potatoes and 


j all kinds of stuff to eat, raise lots 


of hogs, cattle and every kind of 
stuff to sell to feed a starving 


t world. 


Right there is where I am going 
to differ. I say for a farmer to 


| grow enough.of this stuff for his 


own uses and no more and then of 
whatever he can grow, such ag cot- 


grow all he can and be sure that | 
for the year 1922 that there will be | 
just as little foodstuff produced in 
Georgia as the farmers can possibly 
do on themselves and make none of 
this stuff to sell, for all that kind 


of stuff he produces, such as syrup 
at loc to 20c per gallon'or corn at 
‘30c to 40c pér bushel and other 
products at the same price in pro- 
‘portion only leaves him that much 
worse Off and puts that much more 
stuff on the market for the mid- 
dleman to-speculate in. 


The ‘writer was in Dallas, Texas, 
Georgia cane 


“n can’ and the same sy rup will not 
bring the farmer here put up in 
cans Over 40¢ to 50c: They say that 
the high freight rates is the cause, 


so if the railroads are taking all 
the profits that should come to us| 


in freights,..we are fools to make 
the stuff and givex<it to them and 
the ee we quit, the better off 
we will be , 

Bo let's have a new logan for 
hext year. Instead of growing all 
the foodstuff we can and allowing 
the speédnlators and railroads and 
express companies 
profits Wwe should have, let’s go 
on @ nice quiet littre strike and, re- 
fuse to grow any more stuff to eat 
than we need for ourselves and 
maybe.that if the railroads have a 
year of rest and the speculators a 
year of quiet and the express com- 
panies and other’ transportation 
agencies a year of light business 
that they will all “oatch up with 
their hauling” and will be inclined 


to show us a little more mercy and 
not want to take all when we have 
something to ship again and maybe 
the general public who are always 
advising us what to plant and how 
to run our business will grow more 


, or less sympathetic with us ag they 


might have to gréw a few acres of 
corn and raise a:pig or two if all 
we farmers were to quit Yeeding 
them for nothing fer a.year, and by 


that time they might find out by |

VINDICATION OF ’ 
THE GOLD STANDARD 


(From Bulletin National City Bank.) 

The state of the currencies at 
the present time and the chaos of 
the exchanges ghould give to many 


people a better understanding of 
the seryices which the gold stand- 
ard has rendered to the world in 
rthe past, and expose conclusively 
the futility of the schemes for a 
aper currency without provisions 
or redemption. 


When the gold standard was in 
effect in all the principal coun- 


tries the currencies of those coun- 
tries were in practically fixed re- 
lations to each other. The inhab- 
itants were doing business upon a 
common plane of values. They had 
a common language of prices. The 
price of wheat in Odessa, Buenos 
Aires, Sydney, Bombay, Budapest,

Answer—Many elderly persons find 
a pint or.so of rather hot water 
taken on rising each morning a bene-

to it. The addition of salt adds noth-

These arguments are born anew

of men who think they are original

exposed, not in one country alone, 
but in dozens of countries. The 
resulta have not been due to par-

Washington, January 1—The farm-

Secretary of Agriculture Wallace

“T see nothing which indicates * |

seem to be promise of better times. ~ 
both for the farmer and for those 
whose business is largely dependent

While unwilling to make “any hard 
and fast prophecies,” the secretary. 
said there are signs which indicate 
“that the coming year should be a

cial agencies created to meet the farm- 
er’s needs, bringing a lowering of in- 
terest rates, reductions already made 
in freight rates on farm products, re- 
duction in the cost in 1922 of produc- 
ing farm crops, and a probable in- 
crease in the price of grain following 


what seems likely to be a decrease in 
acreage planted to such crops. 

“The paralyzing effect of the sud- 
den drop in prices last year is wear- 
ing off.” the secretary declared, “and 
farmers will enter the new year more 
hopefully, believing that the worst 1s 
over. | 

“Farmers are coming to see more 
clearl ythat the task of putting farm- 
ing on a sound business basis is real- 
ly up to them, and that through or- 
ganization they cau reduce marketing 
costs,” the statement continued. “In 
this they will have tncreasing help 
from the department of agriculture 
and the various state agricultural col- 
leges, which now see better than be- 
fore that they must give the farmer 
the same sort of help in the market- 
ing of their crops that they have been 
giving him in the production. 

“With prices of farm products fall- 
ing and the future very uwneertain 
even those farmers who had money 
laid by—and there are a large num- 
ber of such—have been restricting 
their buying to what they had to have. 
Now with the growing belief that 
prices have hit bottom, buying will be 
resumed and should increase in vo)l- 
ume, and manufacturers and retailers 
who make or are selling things that 
farmers need or want should have bet- 


stationed at the federal penitentiary. 
and prior to the prison work he held 
a responsible position at the Smith- 
sonian institute in Washington. 

He volunteered and served with the 
American army during the Snanish- 
, American war, and was in the Philip- 
| pines three vears during the Philip 
pive insurrection. 

During the fourth liberty loan he 
wes credited with having sold more 
Liberty bonds in the first ward than 
anvone else. 

It is understood that a number of 
influential Atlantans have sent Post- 
master-General Hays letters commend- 
ing him. 


REIDSVILLE JAIL 
TO BE IMPROVED 
AT $12,000 COST 


The state department of public wel- 
fare has received notice from Tattnall 
county that work is to begin imme- 
diately on the alteration of the county 
jail at Reidsville, the improvements 
to cost about $12,000, bringing this 
jail up to standard as a humane. deten- 
tion prison. \ 

The report of the inspection of the 
department of public welfare was 
adopted in full by the county grand 
jury, and included in its presentments. 
The commissioners acted almost im- 
mediately upon the report, employing 
a construction company. The plans 
for alterations were submitted to the 
welfare department as required by 
lay;. and all its suggestions, with -but 
a few exceptions, were incorporated 
in the final plans adopted.

throng which heard him two yews ago 
may be taken as a criterion, the mas- 
ter pianist will draw one of the largest 
audiences of the season. He will be 
presented under the joint direction of 
the Atlanta Musie club and the Salter 
Musical bureau, as the fifth event of 
the All-Star. Concert series. 

Rachmaninoff, the composer, had 
long been known in America as the 
author of many trethendous works for 
the piano, but it was not until the 
Russian revolution drove him from his 
own country that the Americans 
learned to know Raéhmaninoff, the 
pianist. He wag conductor of the Im- 
perial Opera af Petrograd when the 
war broke out (he is one of the-worlds 
foremost conductors, as well as pianist 
and composer), and music in Russia 
came to an end. 


He made his way to America and 
began a concert tour, which became 
u veritable sensation. Not since Pade- 
rewski was at the height of his fame, 
had a pianist drawn such audiences, 
and Paderewski himself made no

will specialize in the preparation of 
federal returns of all kinds, including 
income tax, capital stock and inherit- 
ance tax matters. Claims’ for abate- 
ment and refund will also be handled 
for taxpayers when it is believed that 
they are entitled to adjustment. 


An interesting feature connected 
with Mr. Hoyt’s engaging in this bus- 
iness is that he has been urged by 
many leading lawyers and business 
men of Atlanta who had dealings with 
him while serving as chief deputy col- 
lector of internal revenue to special- 
ize in this work, so that his valuable 
experience will still be available to 
them and to the public. 


Mr. Hoyt made a remarkable rec- 
ord at Washington, and it is said 
that it stood second to none in that 
department of the government service 
comprising 68 districts. 

The opinions rendered by Mr. Hoyt 
are in genera] use among attorneys, 
executors and administrators. 

Mr. Hoyt in July last published a 
work that has been warmly com- 
mended by Georgia corporations. 

The leaflet is entitled “How to Pre- 
pare Your Capital Stock and Tax Re- 
turns Line by Line.” ‘The cost of 
the printing and distribution of this 
work was borne by him individually. 
Mr. Hoyt is also the author of “Part- 
nership-Corporation Insuranee as 
Business Protection.” which is now 
being revised for its third edition. 
This publication will be followed by 
the work on which Mr. Hoyt is now 
engaged, entitled “Federal Estate and 
State Inheritance Taxation.” 

Mr. Hoyt is one of Atlanta’s most 
highly esteemed business. men and 
Tanks as one of the best. accountants 
in Georgia.

vummittees for the year. 

The next order of business will be 
the election of a mayor pro tem., and 
to him the mayor will surrender the 
gavel. The candidates for this of- 
thee ure Alderman D. R. Wilder and 
Alderman A. H. Cochran, and the cun- 
test between them has been one of 
the hottest in the recent mmory of 
council members. Both sides cun- 
cede that the race is close, and both 
sides are claiming victory. There will 
be two or three nomigations for the 
position of provisional mayor pro ten.., 
it is said. 

Mayor Key has made it plain that 
he wiil deal in some plain talk in his 
message. He will attack critics of 
the police department, while at the 
same time he will ask for a large in- 
crease in the torce. He will defend 
the bond commission against recent 
attacks made upon it. 

Charter Revision. 

Other outstanding features of the 
message will be the mayor’s recom- 
mendation for charter revision which 
would make the city government more 
compact; suggestion that the sanitary 
department be motorized and recom- 
inendation for the removal of the city 
stockade to the dairy farm and the 
establishment of an opportunity

NEW YEAR ADDS 
3,000 CITIZENS 
TO ATLANTA LIST 


Kirkwood with its population of 
3,000 people, became a part of Atlantu 
Sunday. From now on its citizens are 
Atlantans, enjoying full privileges ex- 
tended by the municipal government 
and assuming the responsibilities im- 
posed. Public affairs of Kirkwood 
will be transacted threugh city hali 
and the board of education will direct 
control of its school system. 

Whether Kirkwood will become a 
separate ward or be added to a wari 
already created is a question as yet 
undecided, and will be one of the first 
important matters to engage the new 
council’s attention, 

A resolution will be offered, prob- 
ably at the meeting of council this 
afternoon, providing for temporary an- 
nexation of Kirkwood to the eleventh 
ward and the adoption of a request 
t» the legislature to authorize and 
designate Kirkwood as the twelfth 
ward. Sentiment of council members 
is divided and a fight is promised.

The Old Year Is Gone— 


What Will You Do 
With the New ? 


W HAT have you done with the promises. you 
made a year ago? Have you kept them, or 
were they just “wishes”? 

What of the promise to save enough of your in- 
come to enable you to meet your obligations 
promptly, and to take care of the emergencies? 


Did you open a Savings Account, and deposit each 
pay day a definite percentage of what you re- 
ceived, or have you gone ahead in the same old 
way, spending what you had and depending upon 
luck to take care of the emergencies? 


Let's Get Down to Brass Tacks 


Let’s realize that we can never get ahead unless 
we learn te save. 


Let’s promise ourselves that we will quit thinking 
of Saving as something possible only for the other 
fellow. 


The easy, sensible way to save is to open a Savings 
Account at the Citizens and Southern Savings De- 
partment, where every convenience is provided 
and where your money will be absolutely safe. — 


You know, of course, that the Citizens and South- 
ern pays compound interest on Savings Accounts.

every year at Christmastime, and be- 
hieves that the giving of a community 
nativity play will grow to be a Jocal 
custom. Before long she will take up 
work on the manuscript of a passion 
play to be presented at Eastertime, al- 
though the general plan of the drama 
is not yet fully worked out. 

According to Mrs. Jackson, prepara- 
tions for the performance to be given 
next year will begin .in the near future, 
so as to give ample time for perfect- 
ing the details of the drama. Ali 
choirs of the city will be called on to

chorus which will commence practice

New Year’s Greetings 
To Georgia W. C. T. U. 


New Year’s greeting to W. C. T. U. 
women of Georgia. 

“It is a sacred privilege to count 
one in the ranks of the Woman's 
Yhristian Temperance union; to be- 
come an inheritor of its radiant past; 
a participant in its luminous present, 
and a_ builder of its brightening 
future."—Anna A. Gordon. president 
of National and World’s W. T. C. U. 

We are living in a glorious age, 
with the legalized liquor traffic gone, 
and the nations gathered together to 
agree on terms of world peace» We 
rejoice that the idea of the “federa- 
tion of the world” took hold of the 
minds of our great leaders and that 
“Peace and Arbitration” has for many 
years been one of the departments in- 
cluded in our do-everything policy. 

The New Year finds us celebrating 
the second anniversary of the day 
when the legalized traffic in intoxi- 
cants passed out in our nation. May 
we not expect a statewide observance 
of the day? Programs for the occa- 
sion have been mailed to every local 
president bearing the request that all 
civic, religious and patriotic organiza- 
tions uyite with us in celebrating the 


y. ; 
But the very observance of January 
16, the anniversary of the second year 
of the ratification of the eighteenth 
amendment, is a reminder of an un- 
finished task. Ours is the duty and 
privilege of creating inthe public mind 
the profound conviction that alcohol 
is a poison, and thus make obedience 
to law easy and logical. We may 
expect to reach only the young with 
this teaching. With the coming of the 
New Year, shall we not pledge our- 
selves anew for law enforcement for 
the adult lawbreaker? 

The continued session of the con- 
ference for the limitation of arma- 
ments is a eall for continued prayer. 
Our Georgia W. C. T. U. service flag 
has at least thirteen hundred con- 
vincing reasons for disarmament.

CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? 


+ jalan something I can not under- 
stand, 

How a person can bear to owe 
money and at the same time have lux- 
uries of various sérts which the people 
to whom the money is owed cannot 
afford. : 

Here is a case which came to my at- 

tention recently. Some friends of 
mine who by hard work, thrift and 
self-denial had managed to put by 
several hundred dollars out of a salary 
which many people would consider 
barely enough to scrape by on (to 
say nothing of saving) loaned most 
of this money to some friends (7) of 
theirs. The time has now come when 
they need that money back, and need 
it bady. They have always lived so 
simply that they have no possessions 
on which they could borrow money, 
and because of unemployment they) 
need their savings, And the people 
to whom they loaned it are not able 
to pay. 
Yet the latter have a piano. an au- 
tomobile and a _ victrola, and _ the 
Uaughter of the family goes to dancing 
school. How can tlfey face their 
friends, knowing that. they are per- 
mitting themselves such luxuries and 
leaving their debts unpaid. 


I Should Think They’d Hate+Them- 
selves. 


How can they face themselves? _ 
It would be .bad enough to: be in 
debt if. they were scrimping and de- 


than themselves would be an ever 
present shame. 

I once got a dentist to talking about 
his bills and he told me tuect many 
people would let bills of hundreds of 
dollars sc for years, while at the same 
time they rode about in expensive ma- 
chines, sent their children to private 
schéols, went to expensive summer 
places, bought their wives fur coats. 
These apparently were necessities to 
them, whereas the decency of prompt 
payment of bills was not. Strangely 
enough he did not seem to resent it as 
much as I did. “Every one has to 
put up with it,” he said. “No use 
minding.”

The Cleaners Should Rejoice T 
Women, Aided By Their Dress- 
makers, Have Turned Away Ik'rom 
Black te White. ‘The New Clothes 
Yromise a Strong Season tor 
Cotorless Gowns. 
Fashion appears to have accepted 

every’ white fapric known to the looms 

except those that can be washed. The 
cleaners will have their hands filled 
with work if the summer proceeds as 
the winter prophesies. ee 
There was an accepted tradition 
that hot weather brought forth old 
and new pieces of muslin, linen, duck, 
embroidery, net, and cotton lace for 
frocks that went to the tub and return- 
ed without complaint from the laun- 
dress; no one thought of taffeta, crepe 
de chine, and cloth. Anyone who liv- 
ed in the south before the last war 
overturned mankind and his ways, re- 
members with a gasp of horror those 
buge straw baskets filled with starch- 
ed white muslin clothes coming in 
the back gate on the-heads of negresses 
who supposed, probably, that all the 
world took its washing this lightly. 
There were a dozen of each under- 
‘carment, usually, in those snow-white 


waists, and so many handkerchiefs 
that no one counted them. | 

Né one in the south today régards 

‘s procedure as anything but luxu- 
rious and well-nigh prohibitive. Even 
the rich would hesitate to send out a 
weekly wash like this. Men, women, 
manners and morals have changed 
since that April day in 1917. ~ .. 

Here in a nutshell, therefore, is 
the reason for the hesitancy of the 
dressmakers to suggest to women that 
ther should wear white clothes that 
wash. Naturally, France knows lit- 
ile or nothing of this old American 
custom of wearing clothes that go 
to the tub for four months of the 
year, for hot as France is in the 
summer, its people are possessed with, 
a greater idea of saving and thrift 
than the canny Scot. It can make 
its whole national life conform to 
the expenditure of a sou. 

Usr«ily whéen France has offered 
the white clothes that clean but do 
not w sh, America has turned up its 
nose at the idea of such pecunious 
ways. There are no noses turned 
up this season. We have learned a

umd time saving. We will adopt the 
Wyropean habit without cavil. Geor- 
cette crepe, silk net, point d’esprit, 
taffeta, Cninese Morocean crepe will 
serve our demands for white clothes. 
Before winter leaves us, we will try 
« t white broadcloth, Angora, brushed 
‘ool, duvetyne, velvet and the other 
white fabrics which high fashien now

This is that small children ought not

}more depressing thar’ to come 
¥stairs in the early morning and find 


but ‘it is not the color one would 
choose for ‘the thick and the short, 
the large-waisted and the heavy- 
shouldered.’ Crepe is the best white 
fabric for such as these, ‘Taffeta, 
broadcloth, kasha, brushed wool, will 
never do. Far better stick to black 
than adopt these fabrics in white. The 
utmost caution and judgment will soon 
be called into service when the warin 
weather approaches. One who has 
not youth nor an ell-like silhouette 
must study ways and means to avoid 
looking like a veritable white ele- 
phant. 

‘ne French do not help us in this 
probiem, except in giving a vhance to 
make a colored background with a 
cape, and adding a ceior to the hut. 
ihey add coloriess beads and bugles, 
galioon and braid to pile white on 
white. Not even a sash of color is 
recklessly thrown on the surface. On 
evening gowns of georgette the lines 
and curves are given through bands 
of beading for it is a season of such 
gewgaws, and strangely enough, these 
things came into full power after the 
first fashions were prepared for the 
winter. . There were a few beaded 


galloons then, but they were used on |.

tion panels by these strips of bead- 
ing. We thought that panels were 
dead, but like pheasant feathers, taf- 
feta, monkey fringe, and ostrich feath- 
ers they must have slumbered, wait- 
ing for a speedy awakening. Prob- 
adly, the revival of the several panels 
on a skirt is only a compromise be- 
tween the stubbornly short skirt and 
the ambitious long one. Fabric must 
reach the ankles, insist the designers, 
and if a woman won't accept it in 
one way. she must accept it in an- 
other. There is a choice. Take it.

need for an evening’s fun with. finger

Make a hole in the center of the piece

large enough to allow your forefinger 
to pass through. Directly under it 


draw with ink a figure of some char- 
acter—an old man, or woman, or a 
girl or boy. | 

On the tip of your forefinger draw 
with ink the features of a face that 
suits the character whose figure you 


vhave made on the card. Put your fore- 


finger through the hole in the card. 
Wiggle it. The entire figure will have 
a surprising | life-like appearance. 
Supply suitable monologue for the

it was a very small teakettle and 
had felt rather ashamed of its size 
when it looked humbly at the larger 
teakettles. 

Therefore, when Mrs. Vinton bought 
it and took it home to Doris, the tea- 
kettle made up its mind that it would 
do its best to make up in other ways 
for what it lacked in size. 

“See the dear ijittle teakettle I 
bought for your grill, Doris,” said 
Mrs. Vinton. “I thought it would be 
nice and comfy to have it here so that 
when your friends come in I can make 
tea for them right her in your room,” 

Doris turned her head wearily and 
looked up listlessly. “It 
small,” she said crossly. “You can’t 
make tea with that.” Her. mother 
sighed and set the teakettle down on 
the grill on the table. Just two months 
ago Doris had fallen and hurt her 
back, and the doctor had ordered six 
months in a plaster cast. It seemed 
to Mrs. Vinton that she could never 
stand it. For two months Doris had 
not smiled. ,' 

“T’ll make a little afternoon tea for 
the two of us now,” said Mrs. Vinton. 
“We'll breAk in the new teakettle.” 

It was a few minutes. later that 
Doris spoke suddenly. “Listen!”

The person who can give you the 
most advice about bringing up your 
children is very apt to’be the very 
young bachelor who has been study- 
ing educational theories or psycholo- 
gy in cellege or the woman who has 
for years been an observer in the child 
raising of her friends, but has never 
taken any part in it herself. Thése | 
people usually have some interesting | 
theories regarding clildren’s toys. 
Sometimes they don’t approve of ready- 
made-bought-in-shop toys at all. Toys 
made from sticks and stone by the 
youngsters themselves are their ideal. 
Others who speak from blissful inex- 
perience insist that toys should al- 
ways be kept in the playroom. They 
would be very strict about this. This

CHAPTER XVI. 

“You surprised me,”* said Mary 
Brook, as sne and Harry L. Rasher 
slowly climbed the hill road toward 
her home. “I was certain you would 
come out of Mr. Stabb’s office a com- 
plete wreck. If you knew him as I 
do, you would be surprised, too, He 
must have been furious with you.” 

“Oh, we had some words. At first 
he was mad, but befote I left be had 
quieted down.” 

“Well, it’s a miracle, that’s all,” 
She looked up into his eyes. “And 
he didn’t even discharge you?” 

“To tell the truth, I’m not sure,” 
With a quizzical smile he abruptly 
changed the subject. 

“Have you worked here very long?” 

She hesitated a moment before re- 
plying. To him she was only one of 
the workers, a cog in a’ big machine, 
and, of course, his question was a nat- 
ural one. 

“This is the only place I have ever 
worked,” she answered. 

“Is this your home?’ 

“I was born here.” 

“But how in the world have you 
kept your cheerfulness—in the face 
of all this?’ 

He pointed to a row of grimy 
houses, depressingly shabby and as 
colorless as the mud in the yards. A 
few windows had white curtains, mak- 
ing a brave but pitiful fight against 
the squalid surroundings. 

“These people are all my friends,” 
sre said, simply. A _ shrill whistle

“That's a signal,” she said, her eyes 
ining. 
A group of dirty children charged 
out of a gate, and farther ahead, from 
each gateway, other children of as- 
sorted sizes came rushing out to the 
sidewalk. They waved their hands to 
Miss Brook. Rasher noted their wide- 
eyed admiration, now somewhat re- 
stranied because of him. 

“These are my friends,” she said. 
“They do this every morning and 
every evening.” 

“They must love you.” 

“They would love anybody who 
treats them kindly.” 

“They don’t seem unhappy,” he re- 
marked, indicating the smiling faces, 

“That’s because they are children,” 
Miss Brook answered. “It’s natural 
for children to be happy if they are 
not actually suffering. They don’t 
know any life but this. The little 
ones hardly ever see their fathers, 
and when they do their fathers are 
too dog tired to feel like playing with 
them.” 

“Why do you stay here?” Rashre 
asked. ‘“Wouldn’t you be happier in 
more cheerful surroundings? You 
could get a position any place.” 

She flushed uncomfortably. She 
was disappointed that he could ask 
the question. When she answered 
there was reproof in her tone. 

‘Perhaps I may find some happiness 
in helping these poor children to be 
happy.” 

“I’m sorry,” he hastened to say. “I 
think you are wonderful, Miss Brook. 
It’s wonderful that there are people 
in the world like you, but I’m afraid

At that moment the thoughts of 
both Mary Brook and Harry Rasher 
flashed to the Lannards, steeped in 
luxury of fashionable New York life. 
No sight of drab drudgery clouded 
their happiness. ‘They did not have

, UD to the front. 


Tom may think pubble-blowing a 
girl’s pastime, but when he finds what 
tricks can be done, he will doubtless 
change his opinion. Here is one for a 
starter. 

Dip a small dish or saucer into the 
soap solution. ‘Then, with a funnel, 
blow a bubble onto the dish. Next 
take a straw (the kind used for drink- 
ing soda) and dip vne end into the 
solution. It ean then be thrust into 
the bubble. By blowing at the other 
end a small bubble will form inside 
the large bubble. Make the bubble 
solution thus: One quart water, four- 
fifths ounce castile soap powder. Al- 
low the powder to dissolve. Then add 
one-third pint glycerin. Let stand 
until all bubbles digappear. This 
gives the best ‘results. When these 
ingredients cannot’ be obtained, use 
the following: ‘Rub ordinary soap 
into a bowl of water until heavy 
lather has formed on the surface. 
Remove the lather and all bubbles, 
and test the solution by dipping the 
forefinger in it.. Thrust your finger 
into the bubble. The bubble should 
not break. If it does, add more soap. 
Other tricks will be described later.

she inquired sweetly. 
Henry gave up. 


The business of transferring the 


title of Jeanne Dare’s property to 


Henry Harrison, and the cheque of 
bank account, occujded little time. 
There was fully three-quarters of an 
hour to spare before Jeanne was due 
at her luncheon. 

She marshalled Henry to a good tai- 
loring establishment where ready- 
made apparel could be secured under 
the lash of necessity. 

“You should always have your eve-

if you-have to buy read-made for busi-

his inquisitiveness to a natural curios-

“Very seldom. I think they may be 
coming here before long, however. The 
daughter, Miss Lannard, is to be mar- 
ried, and before she goes abroad the 
family is to come here for a day.” 

Rasher was staring straight ahead. 
Many questions rushed to his lips, but 
he foreboreyoicing them. A proces- 
sion of memories paraded in his 
thayghts, and it was some time before 
he ventured to speak. 

“Is she attractive?’ he asked so 
solemnly that Miss Brook burst out 
laughing. 

“She’s very pretty,” she said at 
last. “No one can deny that Muriel 
is pretty.”

WHO’S WHO IN THE STORY. 


Jeanne Dare, known in the little 
Iowa town whence she came as plain 
Jane Dare, has set herself up in New 
York as a wealthy woman in the hope 
of snaring a rich husband, In this 
effort she is making use of 

Richard Canby, well-known man 
about town. Canby invites Jeanne 
to a dinner together with 

Mrs. Adele Parkinson, a widow and 
former flame of his. At dinner she 
meets 

Vic Barstowe, heir to the reputed 
millions, who shows signs. of infatu- 
ation with 

Signer Bonnicetti, a famous violin- 
ist, asks only to serve Jeanne, and she 
uses him as a drawing card to her tea 


party. 
Adele foils Victor Barstowe’s at- 
tempt to linger for a tete-a-tete with 


| Jeanne. 


As Jeanne is starting for a dinner 
engagement, Henry Harrison tele- 


He informs Jeanne that he can bor-

BOTHERSOME 
BILLS. 


When they were réady to leave the 
hotel on their combined business and 
shopping expedition, Harrison again 
looked dubiously at Jeanne’s costume. 

He had insisted upon going down- 
stairs to wait for her in the lobby, 
while she changed from her tea gown. 
He seemed to feel somehow that it 
was indecorous for him to remain in 
‘the apartment while she donned her 
frock, despite the barrier of her closed 
aor ee | room door. 

As she got out of the elevator, ad- 
jasting the final. button of her white 
gioves, be looked her over er:

ch-heeled slippers. '

by the elbow and piloted her to- 


“I’m going to a luncheon party as 
and have selected your evening things. 
I must turn you over to Adele Park- 
inson looking correct to the minute.” 

The idea of Henry ever looking cor- 
rect to the minute brought her an in- 
ward smile. e knew from experi- 
ence how difficult it had been for her 
to achieve that air of perfect groom- 
ing—sometimes she doubted if she 
ever HAD achieved it—and her wholé | 
heart and soul had been bent passion- 
ately upon her task. Henry never 
eared. If he were scrupulously clean 
he felt that his duty in matters of 
dress had been adequately performed. 


SOMETHING 

ABOUT CLOTHES. 
Henry spoke worriedly : 
“She——” Jeanne knew he _ re- 
ferred to Adele Parkinson, “wasn’t all 
dressed up like this,” looking down 
at Jeannes smart appearance. “She 
had on a in suit and flat shoes.” 

Jeanne frowned. 

“So Adele is your model of cos- 
tume perfection, is she?” she asked. 
“Remember, Adele ha

them patronized a shop of “ready- 
However, she walked 
boldly in, followed by the embarrassed 
Harrison, told the suave clerk who 
came forward just what was wanted, 
and made the selection herself. 

She knew the clerk was probably 
putting her down as a Broadway gold 
digger who had captured this awkward 
young man, and was trying to bring 
him up to the sartorial standard that 
her ready hand in his pocket had al- 
ready secured for herself. 

The idea rather amused her. How 
almost reversed the real __ situation 
was! It would be she whom some 
man’s money would lift to fit herself 
for his position! 

At length a suit of evening clothes 
was produced which met with Jeanne’s 
approval. At the risk of being late 
for ‘her luncheon, she waited until he 
had tried on the entire outfit. 

He wore a dinner coat well, she 
admitted. His shoulders were straight 
and broad, and the black satin col- 
lar made his face ruddily clean by con- 
trast. 

“You'll do nicely, Henry.” she told 
him in an aside. “Adele will be proud 
of you. She’s right, you DO dwarf 
most New York men!” 

His eyes showed their pleasure like 
a faithful dog that has received an 
unexpected pat. 

“I wish—” he stammered. “I wish 
I was taking you out tonight.” 

Jeanne smiled kindily and patted 
his arm. 

“Nice Henry! And I’ve been so 
horrid to you! But—you'll be com- 
ing to New York again soon now that 
you've found your way. No one can 
ever resist its lure. They all come 
back. It’s like the call of the Bast.” 

He, shook his head. 

She knew that he was thinking that 
he couldn’t come again. He wouldn’t 
have the money. She had taken his 
savings and saddled him with a worth- 
less piece of preperty which would 
raise nothing but taxes. 

She bit her lip and put down the 
thought. 

“Must fly now, Henry!” she held 
out her hand. “Thanks for all you've 
done. I'll neyer forget it, and I'll 
see that you're repaid some dgy. Have 
a good time tonight, and n't let 
Adele Parkinson oe your beart.” 

eyes, following her as _ she 
moved away with airy farewell ges- 
ture, told her that his heart was not 
in his own possession. 

Jeanne caught herself hoping that 
she would seé¢ something resembling 
that look in the eyes of Victor Bar- 
stowe at Rnd distant future.

T oday’s Short Story

You won’t believe me, but I am | 
going to say it anyway: This is a 
ture story. I can’t fool around get- 
ting affidavits and notaries’ seals 
every time I write. facts, but that 
would be necessary to induce people 
to believe me. Since I began writing 
a short story a day I cannot open 
my mouth without people settling 
back to hear another yarn, and my 
wife is as bad as all the rest. If I 
look up to tell her I think it will be 
a cold day tomorrow, she immediately 
responds with the maddening question, 
“Yes,and then what?’ Good heavens 
I’m not romancing all the time! 

_ Anyway, whether she or you be- 
lieve it or not, this is a true story. 
It was revealed to me on a recent 
delightful excursion in Virginia. The 
girl's name is something like Kath- 
erine Rudge; she is a demonstrator of

was bound for Lynchburg when we 
were held up by a wreck. Faced with 
a three-hour delay, I asked Katherine, 
if she would not like to have dinner’ 
with me, 
“That would be a nice way to pass 
the time,” she answered, “but my 
friends will be waiting in Lynchburg.;

“All right.. Supposing we just talk

“No, sir,” protested Katherine.

happy ending to my life, and when- 
ever he gets ready I -want to let him.” 
“Fine. Just give me his name, and 
I'll have you falling into his arms at 
the finish.’ ‘ 

Katherine narrowed her eyes. “Man,

began to figure out in her mind just 
how long she could make her finances 
last on her present scale of living, with 
the recently-made addition of Vrarsis 
son's cheque in payment for her prop- 
erty. - 

The prospect was not glittering. Es- 
pecially when she remembered that in- 
creasing pile of unopened bills in the 
cabinet. She had managed, by paying 
a little here and there, to keep any 
of her creditors from becoming impor- 
tune. She still had quite sufficient 
funds in the bank to pay everything off 
at one clean sweep; but this she 
feared to do, lest she run short of 
actual cash for her daily living ex- 
penses, 

Sometimes—very rarely, of late— 
when she was wakeful at night after 
the excitement of a particularly gay 
party, she would be haunted: by the 
specter of debt which seemed to loom 
beside her bed. In those hours, a 
timid voice within seemed to whisper, 
to urge her to pay off all her 
debts, abandon the struggle, start 
again in a modest way with a clean 
slate. 

But when morning came she called 
herself a fool. 

That afternoon she dropped in at 
Madame Julie’s on her way to keep her 
tea engagement with Canby. She want- 
ed the blue brocade gown. 

To her relief, Madame Julie was 
not in the richly furnished salon where 
the models were shown. Madame 
Julie was Jeanne’s largest creditor. 

She ordered the coveted gown has- 
tily, directing that it be sent to her 
hotel the following day. She was sign- 
ing the order slip when she heard 
Madame Julie’s suave voice:

The Constitution’ s Weekly Detective Story 


* THE AMBASSADOR’S WIFE 


BY E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM

(Continued From Yesterday) 

Monsieur de Lamborne rose 
alacrity., 

“My friend,” he said, “I feel that 
I] have made false pretenses to you. 
With the day I have no fear. A 
thousand pardons for your sleepless 
night.’” 

“My sleepless night counts for 
nothing,” the Baron assured him, 
“but, before I go, would it not be as 
well that we glance together inside 
the safe?” 

De Lamborne shook out his keys. 

“I was about to suggest it,” he 
replied. 

The ambassador arranged the com- 
‘bination and pressed the lever. 
Slowly the great door swung back. 

The two men peered in. 
“Untouched!” De Lamborne 


with 


ex- 


claimed, a little note of triumph in his | 


tone._- 

De Grost said nothing, but held 
out his hand. 

“Permit me,” he interposed. 

De Lamborne was conscious of a 
faint sense of uneasiness, His com- 
panion walked across the room and 
carefully weighed the packed. 

“Well?’ De Lamborne cried. “Why 
do you do that? What is wrong?” 

The Baron turned and faced him. 

“My friend,” he said, this is not 
the same packet.” 

The ambassador stared at him in- 
credulously. 

“You are jesting!” he exclaimed. 
“Miracles do not happen. The thing 
is impossible, 

“It is the impossible, then, which 
has happened,’ De Grost. replied, 
swiftly. “This packet can scarcely 
‘ have gained two ounces in the night. 
Desides the seal is fuller. I have 
an eye for these details.” 


De Lamborne leaned against the|

little wild, but he laughed hoarsely.

“We fight, then, against the crea- 
tures of another world,” he declared. 
“No human being could have opened 
that safe last night.” 

The Baron hesitated. 

“Monsieur de Lamborne,” he said, 
“the room adjoining is your wife's.” 

“It is the salon of Madame,” the 
ambassador admitted. 

“What are the electrical appliances 
doing there?’ the Baron demanded. 
“Don’t look at me like that. De 
Lamborne. Remember that I was 
here before you arrived.” 

“My wife takes an electric mas- 
sage every day,’ Monsieur de Lam- 
borne answered, in a hard, unnatural 
voice. “In what way is Monsieur le 
Baron concerned in my wife’s do- 
ings?” 

“I think that there need be no 
answer to that question,” De Grost 
said, quietly. “It is a greater 
tragedy which we have to face.”

hand shot out. 
avoided the blow. 

“You shall answer to me for this. 
sir,’ De Lamborne cried. “It is the 
honor of my wife which you assail.” 

“IT maintain only,” the Baron an- 
swered, “that your safe was entered 
from that room. A search will 
prove it.” 

“There will be no search there,” 
De Lamborne declared, fiercely, “I 
am the Ambassador of France, and 
my power under this roof is abso- 
lute. I, say that you shall not cross 
that threshold.” 

De Grost’s expression did not 
change. Only his hands were sudden- 
ly outstretched with a curious ges- 
ture—the four fingers were raised, the 
thumbs depressed. Monsieur De 
Lamborne collapsed. 

“I submit,” he niuttered.

“Thanks,” said Meiny. “Now we're

way I can help you, by knowin’ the

“Well, there are beds upstairs at

“Huh!’ growled Meiny 
“What you want now?’ 
“Pssst! Slide me a couple 0’ pills, 
will you, eh? I must ha’ lost mine 
somehow, an’ I’m all in.” 

The pallor of Dan’s sunken, parch- 
ment-like face, the twitching of his 
fingers, the blinking of his eyes be- 
trayed the terrible intensity of the 
craving that consumed him, 

Meiny nodded comprehension, slid a 
hand into the pocket of his loud, 
checked coat, and produced a small 
box of round white  tablets—half- 
grain of morphine pills. With pitiable 
eagerness the dope fiend snatched it, 
twitehed off the cover and shook two 
tablets into his emaciated palm. 
These he was just about to pop into 
when a* powerful hand 
smashed the box to the floor and sent 
the pellets spmning into the sawdtst. 

“None 0’ that in here!” cried Brad- 
ford, his face qa thundercloud of an- 


angrily. 


‘ger. “No doping here! Get out !?:

Meiny surveyed him with narrowing | 


“You son of ”* snarled Meiny, 
showing his fangs like a wolf, 

The phrase was never finished, - One 
swift leap. With hands on tle counter, 
and Bradford was over—over and 
clutching for Meiny’s. coat collar. 

It must have been that Meiny lost 
his head completely. How else would 
he have lashed out with his soft fist 
at the white-starched bulk in front of 
him? The blow glanced harmlessly. 

Smash!-Meiny reeled downward, 
his ears ringing with echoes of Brad- 
ford’s clean drive to his jaw. His 
head crashed against a table; he 
rolled groveling in the sawdust and 
called blasphemously upon his Maker 
to inflict eternal torment on Brad- 
ford. 

Chairs scraped; some clattered 
backward as men started up. Dan. 
unmindful of his chief's downfall, his 
ratlike soul fixed only on the infinite- 
ly precious pellets, scrambled on 
hands and-knees to rescue two. or 
three—at all hazards, to salvage a 
little ef the supremely necessary 
drug. A powerful hand jerked him 
back, raised him and threw him into 
the arms of the sailor-looking fel- 


low. 


“Here, hold this one till I get ‘rid 
of the other!’ commanded Vinton. 
“He’s a doper—don’'t let him get at 
those pills on the floor!’ 

“Aye, aye, sir!’ exclaimed 


than what you got!” 
Unmindful of this sincere. praise. 
Vinton bent over Meiny, who war

the

the scruff, ip a grip of steel. 

“I’]l get you for this!” snarled 
Meiny, trying to worm out of the 
clutching fingers. “VH—” 

“You'll do nothing but clear out 
of here!” ejaculated Bradford, shak- 
ing him rat-and-terrier fashion. 

From Meiny’s inner pocket flirted 
a little sheaf of papers. 
them Dan set up a horrid outcry of 
rage and grief. Meiny mouthed an 
obscenity, and his mottled hand 
grabbed for the sheaf; but Vinton 
was too quick for. him. 

“Prescription blanks! Signed,” he 
cried, peering at them. “Ah, now I 
get your game!” 

Somebody thrust the door open. 
Bradford’s free hand reached down 
and caught the slack of his prison- 
er’s trousers. Propelled by a power- 
ful swing the son of Irvin Stagg shot 
fa into the middle of. the narrow

CHAPTER VIII. 
Gathering Forces. 

Bradford returned to his lunch- 


room and to the sailor, who still held | 


captive the cringing, nerve-quivering 
Dan. 

At sight of Bradford, th: dopester 
shrank supinely. 

4 ain’t to blame for 
nothin’,” he whined. “You can’t 
blame me, can you, eh? I never want- 
ed to come in here, s’help me. An’ 
1 never—” 

“Forget it!’ Bradford reassured 
him, laying a hagd on the prisoner’s 
emaciated shoulder. “I’m not blam- 
ing you for anything. I figure that 
he’s the ringleader in this dirty busi- 
ness, and you're only the tool. Come 
upstairs with me, and let's. talk 
things over.” 

A leok of terror crept into Dan’s 
glazed eyes. His. nerves, already 
overstrained from lack of the drug, 
seemed on the point of giving way 
entirely. He began to twitch and 
fidget with pitiable signs of collapse. 

“Gimme just two o’ them pills,” 
he whispered hoarsely, with terrible 
earnestness. “Just two, an’ I'll get 


— it, 
, 


“No!” He took Dan's skinny arm 
and drew him toward a door that 
gave upon some stairs. In spite of 
aif his protests, supplications and 
entreaties, upstairs Dan had to go. 
Bradford knocked at a door.

“Sorry to ask you, but you've got |

while,” said Vinton. “I'll be busy for 
an hour or so. Go right down, 
please.” 

“All right,” the voice responded. A 
moment later, deaf to all protesta- 
tions, Bradford had thrust Dan into 
a small room plainly furnished with 


“My own quarters,” said he. “I’m 
to give you the best in the 
house.” 
“Give me the—? What—what you 
talkin’ about?’ stammered Dan. 
“You're going to stop with me a 
while, that’s all.” 
“Stay here, eh? I don’t! T can’t.” 
“Yes, you can and will,’ Bradford 
assured him. “Sit down, there, and 
let's talk things over reasonably.” 
He pointed toward one of the chairs, 
into which Dan’ sank limply. He 
himself sat on the bed. “Now, then,” 
said he, “as I understand this mat- 
bP 


er— 
“T tell you I ain’t to blame, nor 
nothin’.’ whimpered Dan. “If you 
have me pinched, you'll be shovin’ 
the wrong guy.” 
' “Pinched?” queried Bradford. 
“What ever gave you that idea? I 
haven’t the slightest notion in the 
world of having you pinched, so for- 
get it!” : 
A look of amazement overspread 
Dan’s quivering features, 
“You ain’t?’ he quavered. “You 
ain’t, eh?’ |

Dan peered at him with blank eyes 
of astonishment. 
— : not. T've got better

Qsh« . uc. in me with him, an’ all? 
Say! They been tellin’ round ~the 
North End you’re a right guy, an’ I 
guess they hit it O. K. at that!” 
Then with a change of expression, a 
wheedling, sly and ingratiating air, he 
added “You wouldn’t mind givin’ 
me—? 


tatesly 


”? 


“You'll get nothing but free board 
and room, for a while,” Bradford in- 
terrupted. “Not a single pill!’ 

“No, no, no!” he wailed. “My. 
Gawd, mister—it’ll kill me! I can’t 
sand it; I can’t! What you goin’ 
to do to me, eh?” 

“Do? Going to cure you. Going 
to make a man of you, stand you on 
your feet, get you a job and finally 
turn you loose, on your word of honor 
never to touch the damnable stuff 
again. That's all.” 

Dan’s eyes seemed 
horror at the prospect. 


“T can’t!” he whispered in a kind of 
hoarse falsetto. “You don’t 
stand this thing, mister. [It ain’t like 
the booze; a guy can sidestep that, 
an’ get by. But this——! It’s O. K. 
so long as you connect with it, reg-lar; 
but when you don’t Gawd! Oh, the 
| pains in the joints an’ all over—an’ 
the twitehes an’ horrors—an’ them 
damn rats gnawin’ at your guts. If 
there’s hell:on earth, mister, it’s bein’ 
rcut off from the dope. An’ you—you 
ain’t goin’ to shove me up against 
that, are you, eh? A good guy like 
you wouldn’t throw a duck that way, 
would he?’ 

Bradford looked very grim as he 
answered : 

“You and I are going to fight this 
thing through, and do it right. Tackle 
it like a man! No use tapering off 
on the dose.. No matter how lon 
you get it, stopping the last little bi 
drags on you just as hard as chopping 
the whole thing square off, at one 
crack. And it takes weeks, the taper- 
ing off way. No, Danny; make up 
your mind to plunge! Be a man!” 

Bradford leaned forward and thrust 
out his hand. A sudden smoldering 
spark of something long forgotten 
seemed to glow in the wreck’s dull 


eyes. 
“Help me, an’—I’ll try!” he whis- 


to film with 


under- | 


‘Muggs. 


pered. His weak, bony palm was lost 
in Bradford’s warm grasp. “Il do 
anythin’ you say. I guess you'll see 
me through, won't you, eh? What’s 
the first thing now?” 

Coincidentally, an unspeakably out- 
raged Meiny was expounding the sit- 
uation to Muggs Rafferty, under the 
bright lights of the Old Homestead 
cafe. Muggs listened attentively, took 
an occasional sup of strong waters, 
at Meiny’s expense and now and then 
rubbed his blue-shaven chin with a 
formidable hand. 

“An’ not only that,’ Meiny was 
saying, “but he frisks me of some 
papers that would of meant thousands 
to Dan an’ me; an’ he hands me a 
wallop on the jaw—see here?-—~an’ 
drags me along the floor an’ gives me 
the G. B, into the alley. <An’ then 
he keeps Danny, on me; captures bim, 
see? An’ won't let him go. An’ what 
he don’t know already he'll pump out 
o Dan. That means a pineh for 
several I could mention. Get me?’ 

“Surest thing you know!” growled 
“Who is this fresh, silk- 
stockin’ guy, anyhow?’ 

“Search me. I never saw him be- 
fore. An’ I don’t want to, again. 
Trim him good an’ proper. That'll! 
turn the trick. Go to him with the 
knucks, an’ do it right. There’s 
twenty beans in it for just a few 
minutes’ play—cinch! Go to it, old 
sport. Atta boy! You're the kid 
can handle your mitts, believe me!” 
Flatteringly he felt of Rafferty’s bi- 
ceps, and nodded strong epproval. 

“Well, jf it comes to that, I guess 
yes, wif,’”’ Muggs assented, inflating 
his chest and glancing surreptitiousls 
at himself in the fly netting mirror 
back of the bar. “I was middleweight 
champeen of New England in 1909, 
an’ though I may have snuffed up o 
few in the booze line, since then, [’'m 
still there wit’ the punch.”

The easterners arrived here in ex-

Much of California's scoring |

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Berkeley, Cal., January 1.—Power- 
ful’ off-: ckle. bucks, forward passes 
and punting probably will be used by 
the University of California eleven in 
offensive play against Washington and 
Jefferson at’ Pasadena, Cal., in the 
annual New Year’s day gast vs. west 
football game. 

California’s team, probably the 
strongest ever developed in the west, 
using mainly -tackle bucks and an 
aerial attack, ‘went through a hard 
schedule this year without being de- 
feated and without even being forced 
to exert its full strength. Generally 
California punts a great deal, waiting 
for the “break” and when the “break” 
comes then starts its strong advance. 

No defeats have been suffered by 
the Bears since 1919. Last year the

PREPS START 
GRIND AGAIN 


BY ROY E. WHITE. 


It’s a sad feeling to know that the 
holidays for Christmas and New Year 
are over. The prep athletes of the 
city are filled with the holiday spirit, 
but this afternoon all that business 
will have te be cast aside. 

Practically every prep basketball 


team in the city, with the exception | 


of Marist nad University School, cast 
aside all basketball ideas during the 
holidays and enjoyeé themselve to 
the fullest extent, but this afternoon 
every team will settle down to the 
final practices before the opening, Jan- 
uary 14. Marist and University hela

idays. arist had a game with a 
ceam from the Federal prison. This 
game put the confidence needed into 
tLe Marist five and with two weeks 
more before the opening date the ea- 
det five should be primed for prey ac- 
tion. , 

The G. M. A. .five will not get to- 
gether before Wednesday, due to many 
of the boys living out of the city. Tech 
High, Boys’ High, Marist and Univer- 
sity School basketball candidates will 
have the first practice of the year this 
afternoon. The coaches are ready for 
the final drive. ‘there will probg- 
bly be several new candidates to ap- 
pear in uniform this afternoon on lo- 
cal courts. Every coach, with the ex- 
ception of Burbage at G. M. A., has 
already cut the squads to a very lim- 
number of candidates, but new 
faces are continually coming out for 
practice, and several are expected to 


i get into the scrimmages during the 


week,

HOWARD GETS 
COACH COPE 


BY MARVIN M’CARTRY. 

Birmingham, Ala., January 1.— 
(Special.)\—Howard college authori- | 
ties have found the man to take 
charge of their athletics next year. | 
te is Harris Cope, who last week | 

gned as director of athletics at How- 
ard college. Cope assumes charge of 
athletics at the local‘ college on Au- 
gust 1, 1922, and will act as head ' 
coach in football next season. Al- | 
though Cope signed his contract last 
Wednesday, no announcement of that 
fact was made by Howard college 
authorities until Saturday. 

Harris Cope will be remembered 
by football lovers as the man who 
turned out stich wonderful football 
teams at Sewanee, where he was ar 
we- 
wanee’s best teams were turned out 
under the Cope regime at the Ten- 
nessee ifistitution, and his followers 
are predicting.as brilliant a career 
at Howard college for Cope as he en- 
joyed at Sewanee. 

In making the announcement of 
the signing of Harris Cope, Howard 
college officials would not state the 
terms of the contract, or the length 
of service the eénfract calls for.

Starting a new year in sport is an occasion for summing wp, 
accounting and. resolving to do better. 
a better prospect than it did 1921. 


Ps 
a 


Fact is, sport faces 1922 with 
With the whole world settling 


down and returning to regular and safe pursuits, sport is in the same 


position. 


I am much encouraged over the outlook not so much over 


the reforms or changes may come as over the fact that the intent, 
in the majority of sports is toward improvement. 

There are things that the leaders shall resolve upon; and among 
the resolutions these should stand out prominently: 


Baseball Club Owners—To reduce 
the ridicule -press egent prices al- 
leged to be paid.for ball , players. 

Baseball Players—To play ball, ob- 
serve discipline and work for the team 
instead of figuring the gate receipts. 

Baseball Managers—to cease claim- 
ing everything in sight, and get the 
work out of what players they have. 

Jockey Club—To treat big gam- 
blers and big racing stables that gam- 
ble the same as the jockey or poor 
trainer is treated. 

Race Horse Owners—To treat 
horses as if they are horses, not ma- 
chines used for gambling purposes. 

Race Gamblers—To limit wagers 
to an extent that betting does not 
—— trainers or jockeys. 

ennis Promoters—To avoid match 
making that tends more toward draw- 
ing a “gate” than toward sportsman- 
ship. 
To avoid seedinf the draw-for the 
benefit of the commercial end rather 
than for the sport. 

Football—To evade the taint of pro- 
fessionalism. 

To teach football players that the 
object is to play straight and hard, 
and that victory is a matter of minor 
consideration compared with giving 
the best they have to the team. 
.To teach players that a ribbon of 
honor is greater than a swarm of 
riches. . | % 

To teach students that they honor 
their school more when cheering a 
beaten team that has done its best 
than they do in snake dances follow- 
ing victories. 

To teach students that betting on 
the team does -not show loyalty, but 
shows muckerishness. 

To Fight Promoters—That in spite 
of everything, honesty is the best 


policy. 
To Fight Managers—That they can 
not put over anything more than once, 
and that the reaction. is greater than 
the action. 
To Fighters—That giving your best 
efforts and trying all the time is-what 


| counts with the crowds, and that the 
fellow who is knocked out trying to | 


sports, football, basketball and _base- 
ball. He has had considerable ex- 
perience in all three branches of ath- 
letiess and should be able to handle 
one as well as the other. 

Howard college authorities con- 
sider themselves lucky in signing 
Cope, who built up quite a reputa- 
tion for himself as a football coach 
fle ha: served on the football rules 
committee with Walter Camp and 
other notables in the gridiron world. 
and is said to have a very thorough 
knowledge of the pigskin gaie. 

Proves .Xbility. 

Cope proved while at Sewanee that 
it does not require a large student 
body to build up winning football 
teams. While dthletic director at the 
Tennessee institution. Cope turned out 
championship ‘teams from one of the 
smallest student bodies of any of the 
major Dixie colleges. Howard col- 
lege authorities. are looking. for great 
things from Cope, and are planning 
a rejuvenation of athletics at the 
local school. 

It was stated that several appli- 
eations for the position as assistant 
uthletie director at Howard are be- 
ing taken into consideration, and that 
an assistant coach will be secured as 
soon as the new athletic director, 
Harris Cope, has had time to go over 
the applications. 

: Played at Sewanee. 

Harris Cope, who is in business 
at Cartersville, Ga., started his ath- 
letic career at Taft school in Water- 
town, Conn. Later he played on Se- 
wanee Military academy’s athletic 
teams and then graduated to the uni- 
versity. 

While at Sewanee, Cope played 
four years on the varsity football so 
baseball, teams, and captained the 
Tiger eleven in 1901. Cope made a 
great record as a Tiger. and was soon 
signed as assistant coach at Sewance. 

He was assistant athletic director 
at Sewanee during the years of 1904, 
1907 and 1908, and in 1909 took over 
the position as head athletic director. 
He was head coach for eight years, 
from 1909 through: 1916, when he 
left school to enter business at Car- 
tersville, Ga. 

Team Won Dixie Title. 


In 1909 Cope’s Sewanee eleven won 
the undisputed southern champion- 
ship, and was runner-up for the title 
in 1910 and 1912. His teams de- 
feated Vanderbilt in 1909 and 1914, 
and fied the Commodores in 1911. 
Since Cope’s departure from athletics 
at Sewanee; the Tigers have lost to 
Vanderbilt every year. 

Harris Cope, while in business at 
Cartersville, a., has coached 
the town and high school teams, turn- 
ing out very creditable elevens among 
the youngsters. He has seen practi- 
cally every important game played in 
Atlanta since 1917, and considers him- 
self very well up on modern football. 


On Rules Committee. 


In 1914 and 1915, Cope served on 
the national football rules committee, 
along with Walter Camp and other 


notables. reat 
Cope visited Birmingham Wednes- 


day for a-conference with Howard col- 
lege officials. It was then that he 
signed his contract as athletic direc- 
tor at the local institution, although 
announcement of the fact was with- 
held until yesterday. . 

Howard college men should consid- 
er themselves fortunate in securing 
the services of Harris Cope, who, by 
his fine record at Sewanee, has prov: 
en his ability as a coach and athletic 
director. He takes charge at Howard 
on August 1. . 4

that the colleetions for | this rT

: 


There was a little story that came 
over from France the other day which 
ought to serve as an object lesson to 
us in America. Two football teams 
were playing at Rouen—during the 
battle -one player took a wallop at an- 
other and as a result he was arrested, 


charged with assault and sentenced to |~ 


pay a fine and a fifteen-day prison 
penalty. 

Figure that out on a basis of West 
Point in the Navy game, of Princeton 
in the Yale game, of Lafayette in any 
game, of Penn State, and the result 
will be that you may figure the pris- 
ons all-cluttered up. “4 

But there is a lesson in the thing. 
The French figure the play just right. 
The player who strikes another wan- 
tonly ought to be punished with jail 
sentence. Of course, in our code, we 
figure that a player ought to take the 
punch and come back and give ene. 

The system is all wrong; not be- 
cause men will hit each other, but he- 
cause such things. are tacitly encour- 
aged. . 

Years ago there was a professor 
lecturing to a bunch of athletes. The 
preceding fall there had been an inci- 
dent. One player had taken a punch, 
had wabbled back into the line, waited 
his chance and knocked his opponent 
cold, This professor, speaking for 
the oldest school in the United States 
and fof a school which waf supposed 
to set the example for all others. 
praised the man who had retaliated 
and knocked out the offender. 

Admitting that it is all right to re- 
taliate and return evil for evil—it 1s 
not sportsmanship. The real code of 
the sportsman, whether he is a foot- 
ball player, a boxer, a ball player, a 
basketball player, a_ tennis man,? a 
golfer, is fourid in the Golden Rule. 

You can’t beat the old Dope Book.

HIGH GOVERNMENT 
OFFICER TO SPEAK 
TO RETAIL MEN 


‘ 

At a recent meeting of the special 
program cummittee appointed by the 
Atlanta Retail Merchants’ associa- 
tion to formplate plans for the an- 
nual meeting and election of officers, 
Thursday, January 26, the Capital 
City club, a tentative program was 
agreed upon. It is expected that a 
government official of international 
prominence will be the special guest 
of honor of the retail merchants at 
this annual meeting. In addition to 
which Gevernor Hardwick. a number 
of local city and county officials and 
men prominent in. the civic affairs 
of Atlanta will be present.

by the Capital City club for the meet- 
ing. In addition to the feature ad- 
dress of the evening, five of the ablest 
and broadest business thinkers in the 
association have been selected to de- 
liver ten-minute talks on the sub- 
ject, “The Business Forecast for 1922

recommendations of value for the com- 
ing year. : 


STINSON SPEAKS - 
AT COLUMBUS 


Columbus, Ga., January 1.—(Spe- 
cial)—Rev. R. D. Stigson, colored, 
head of the Atlanta Normal and 
Industrial institute in Atlanta, de- 
livered the communion sermon at 
the St. James A. M, E. church here 
today. He took his text from “Seek 
Ye First the Kingdom of God and 
Its Righteousness and All Other 
Things Will Be Added Unto You.” 

“I doubt,” he said, “if the church 
means as much to the great mass 
of negroes of today as it meant to 
our fathers. Many of the battles 
which we are striving to fight are 
not with spiritual but with carnal 
weapons. We are offering all sorte 
and are gambling 
every conceivable manner to carry 
our points, whether they be right 
or wrong. These things may seem 
right to us and we may get by at 
it, but not if the Bible is true. 
We are extusing ourselves in that 
we are as good as other people 
and that We are no worse than 
they are. [hese things are dam- 
aging for us and our children. 

“Our race needs the most care- 
ful and consecrated teachings in 
the things of good and pure mor- 
als, a home life and a love for 
continuous hard work in whatever 
We can best do. The good of be- 
ing a hard and constant worker 
saves’ us from idleness and that 
thing with which we are too often 
charged—crime. 

“Our race must be and teach 
hopefulness for the good of our- 
selves and our children, for it was 
the one thing taught by Jesus and 
all other good men. The young 
fellow has been often saved because 
when he could not see his way out 
he acted as his father generally 
did when things were dark about 
him. .Pm Longfellow’s darkest hour 
he ef#w in the gloom ‘Behind the 
clouds the sun is still shining.” 

“If people has aecomplished any- 
thing worthwhile it has been be- 
cause they have been hopeful and 
abided their time and trusted God, 
when prayers seemed to be weak 
and language lame. 

“IT suggest to you today, at the 
opening of a new year, whatever 
your trials or tribulation may be, 
trust in God and wait for @n an- 
swer. Let no cloud, however dark, 
discourage you. Teach it to your 
children. Keep faith In men and 
God, and you will find that all will 
be well. ThKere is no race trouble 
which is greater than God,” he said.

COLONELS IN 
LAST BATTLE 


Dallas, Tex., January’ 1.—The 
“Prayin’ Colonels” of Centre college 
will quit doing thefr gridiron stuff 
for the season here Monday, when 
they play Texas A. & M. at the 
Dallas ‘stadium. 

This game will complete what is 
probadly the longest schedule ever 
played by a college football team. in 
one season, during which Centre ‘cov- 
ered more ground—on the gridiron 
and on the Pullmans—than any col- 
legiate aggregation has ever attempt- 
ed.. They have galloped from Cam- 
bridge, Mass., to San Diego, Cal., 
with a lot of local stops between. 

It will be the last college game 
for “Bo” McMillin, the spectacular 
Centre quarterback, although he has 
arranged a litfle all-star game at Fort 
Worth for next Friday in which he 
will lead a team composed mostly of 
former Centre stars against another 
all-star aggregation. 

Coach Charlie Moran, who brought 
his Kentuckians, here from San Diego, 
where they defeated Arizona last 
— said his men were in good con- 
ition.

Collegian Is Placed 
Third, Just Under Bill

and Johnston. ‘ 


— 


BY WESTBROOK PEGLER. 
United News Staff Correspondent. 
_ New York, January 1.—\oung Vin- 
cent Richards, of Fordham  univer- 
sity, has ciimbed to third place in 
the national tennis rankings. In 1921 


he was ranked No. 12 and some of his 


ffiends thought he deserved a far bet- 
te. place in the list. Now he is placed 
just below William T. Tilden, IL, and 
William M. Johnston, the Californian. 
The ponderous national ranking list 
of 1921 bas been reduced to just 20 
places. . 

Tilden and Richards are given first 
plate in the national ranking for men’s 
doubles. Mrs.. Molla Bjurstedt Mal- 
I-ry is the woman's siniges champion 
without any doubt, and Mrs. May Sut- 
ton Bundy, of Los Angelés, who was 
ealled back to the courts after years 
of retirement when the American 
women were alarmed over the prowess 
of Mile. Suzanne Lenglen, wins back 
fourth plece in’ the list. Miss Marvy 
K. Browne, of Los Angeles, is second 
and Mrs. Marion Zinderstein Jessup. 
of Wilmingion, Del., is third. 

Richards remains junior champion 
but probably will abdicate this year. 

Announcing the standings, the 
Wnited. States Lawn Tennis associa- 
tion explains that there was insuffi- 
cient data upon which to rank the 
rnembérs of the foreign Davis cup 
teams which unsuccessfully tried te 
lift the cup at Forest Hills last sum- 
mer, except the steady Japanese star, 
Ichiya Kumagae. three years a resi- 
dent of New York, who is placed sev- 
enth in the men’s singles. 

In addition to the various national

‘Opens Engagment

Breeze informality is the keynote 
of “The Broadway Whirl of 1921,” 
which returns to the Atlanta thea- 
ter for a week’s engagement, starting 
with a matinee today at 2:30. There 
will also be a matinee Saturday. The 
“Whirl” will bring back’ the ever- 
welcome Blanche Ring, Charles Win- 
ninger, Winona Winter ‘and Jay 
Gould. 
Supporting these players is a com- 
puny of excellent and even capa- 
hilities—Maxson and Brown, Virgin- 
ja Birmingham, Nina Penn, Inez 
(courtney and Gertruce McDonald be- 
ing prominent among the dangers, and 
a chorus of young and pretty girls 
supplying the background for the re- 
volving feast for eye and ear. 

The revue is divided into the cus- 
tomary two acts, each made up of a 
number of colorful. scenes. Among 
the vocal numbers are “From the Pla- 
ya to Madison Square,” “Button Me 
Up the Back,” in which in quite the 
usual style a number of girls invade 
the orchestra chairs and have the 
buitoning done up by lucky aisle-seat 
holders’ “Stand Up and Sing for 
Your Father,’ one of Miss Ring’s 
hits: “Oh, Dearie,” “Stars of Broad- 
way.” with an appropriate girl. set- 
tine: “Oh, Babe,” by eight little 
home runners; the old favorite, “The 
Husband, the Wife and the Lover-r-r” 
with Mr. Winninger, Miss Ring and 
Mr. Gould representing thosg indi-, 
viduals: “Let Cutie Cut Your Cuti- 
cle.” in which those Cuties again 
come tripping down into the audience. . 
this time equipped with manicuring 
tools; a striking illustrated number, 
“Baby Dolls.” and a number of oth- 
ers. The sketches are the same— 
“Worries,” “Getting a Passport” and 
“Moves in the Movies,” in which the 
stars twinkle at their best.

"Uaier the Yeoman act, passed by 
the I-zislature in 1916, it. was pro- 
vided that schoo] children in the state 
should: not be required to pay more 
for textbooks than is paid in any other 
‘state. All publishers were required 
‘tu submit a Wist showing the prices 
at which schoolbooks would be sold. 
Retailers were allowed a 15 per cent 
profit by the state on wholesale costs, 
but in reality the profit amounted to 
only 12 1-2 per cent, it was said. 

Publishers state that as a result of 
the passage of this bill they have sus- 
tained a half-million dollar loss in the 
state, at the léwest estimate, during 
the last five years.

Washington, January 1.—Beginning 
with the new year under orders issued 
by Postmaster General Hays, newly 
appointed postmasters will be required 
to attend school, where they will be 
taught among other things how to 
meet the public, their places in the 
community, how, through publicity, to 
educate the public in the use of the 
mails, how to handle complaints, guard 
the mails and maintain proper rela- 
tionship with the department. Central 
aceounting ypostoffices will be desig- 
nated in each state as schools for the 
instruction of postmesters of the sec- 
ond and third class, under the direc- 
tion of First Assistant Postmaster 
General Work, as “superintendent” of 
schools. 


Newly appointed postmasters will 
be advised by letter “that his city’s 
welfare to a very great extent depends 
upon his willingness and capacity to 
give it better postal service.” After 
the intensive course aimed to impress 
upon the new official that “he is lo- 
cal manager of the biggest institu- 
tion in the world,” he will be required 
to write the department giving a re- 
view of what he had learned, so that 
it may be determined whether he is 
qualified to serve behind a placard 
reading: 

“Ask your postmaster when you 
want to know.”

TO HOLD MEET 
AT ASHBURN 


Ashburn, Gas January 1.—(Spe- 
cial.)—The Georgia Swine ‘Growers’ 
association will hold a meeting here 
January 11 and 12. Several noted 
speakers, including T. W. Hardwick 

have been invited, and there will be 
& show of fine hogs and also a sale. 
Buyers from neighboring markets are 
expected, and it probably will be the 
biggest sale of hogs ever held in this 
section. 


The effort to improve the stock 
of Turner county and also to find a 
market for home-grown products, is 
among the things responsible for 
bringing the association here. Some 
of the best breeders in the state will 
have hogs on exhibition. The breeds 
Shown will include Poland Chinas, 
Duroc-Jerseys, Berkshires. Spotted Po- 
land Chinas, Chester Whites and 
Hampshires. 


It has been learned that the Quaker 
Oats company has consented to send 
their famous motion picture film to 
Ashburn to be shown on the night of 
January 12. The film consists of 
8,000 feet of film of dairy scenes, 
especially showing the four principal 
breeds of dairy-eattle: Jerseys, Guern- 
sey, Holstein and Ayrshire. 


On North Ponce de Leon avenue we have one lot with a frontage of 100 
feet running back 800 feet; a superb building site facing the parkway. 
We can offer this at a special price of $7,000. There is nothing else in 
the entite Druid Hills development any finer than this choice building site, 
If you are planning to build a home at any time, buy your lot now. 
Authorities differ as to the cost of building in the future, but they are‘ 
inanimous in ‘their judgment that the price of building lots will go up.

DR. A. B. M’COY SPEAKS 
AT NEGRO Y. M. C. A. 


The address given at the Colored 

M. C. A. yesterday by Dr. A. B. 
McCoy was well received. He illus: 
trated his subject, “The Bread Mar- 
ket,” by the use of four loaves of 
bread in which he had located ‘certain 
objects in@life that people strive for. 
This novel treatment+of his address 
made a fine Tmpressfon on the large 
audience tit was present. 


At the efose of his address the 
speaker gave each person a New Tes- 
tamént who would agree to ‘read a 
portion of the Scripture each day. 
Quite a number came forward and 
made the promise. 


The annual members’ meeting of 
the Y. M. C. A. will be held next 
Friday evening at 8 o’clock. «There 
will be an election of several. com- 
mitteemen, who will serve on the 
board for the coming year. 


The sensation of the year in the 
drug trade is Aspironal, the two-min- 
ute cold reliever, wuthoritatively guar- 
anteed by the laboratories; tested, 
approved and most enthusiastically 
endorsed by the highest authorities, 
and proclaimed by the cemmon peo- 
ple as ten times as quick and effee- 
tive as whiskey, rock and rye, or any 
other cold remedy they have ever 
tried. 

All drug stores are now supplied 
with the wonderful new elixir, so all 
you have to do tq get rid of that cold 
is to step into the nearest drug store, 
hand the clerk half a dollar for a bot- 
tle of Aspironal and tell him to serve 
you two teaspoonfuls with four tea- 
spoonfuls of water in a glass. With 
your watch in your hand, take the 
drink at one swallow and call for 
your money back in two minutes if 
you cannot feel your cold fading 
away like a dream within the time
