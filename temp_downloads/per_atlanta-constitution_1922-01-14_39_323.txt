discovered that he had picked the

and secured a quantity of morphine 
and ohter narcotics which A 
Warnock kept at police headquar- 
ters. 
“You will have to guard me,” 
Lotsey is said to have told the po- 
lige when it was discovered he had 
picked the cell locks. There is 
not a lock made that I can't open, 
and if you want to keep me here 
you sure will have to guard me.” 
Police Chief Beavers said Satur- 
day morning no charges would be 
made against Lotsey for the burg: 
lary ot Dr. Warnock’s cell. Sheriff 
B. L. Dunbar, of Tayloryille, III.,

for participation in the robbery of 
a bank messenger for the Kincaid 
Trust and Savings bank, where 
$95,000 in cash was secured by the 
highwaymen. 
Lotsey was arrested at the office 
of the American Railway Express 
company Tuesday, when he tried to 
secure his trunk, which had been 
shipped to him from Illinois. Sev- 
leral other men who were with him, 
and who are believed by the police 
to be members cf a gang which has 
operated in Illinois, made their es- 
‘ cape. 
| The trunk which Lotsey was try- 
ling get was searched by the police, 
and a quantity of soap several steel 
| drills and some candles, all said to 
be yegg's tools, were found. Lotsey’s 


| wife was also arrested and held cn a 


charge of suspicion, but was released 
Saturday by Chief Beavers on in- 
|} formation from Sheriff Dunbar that 
she was not wanted. A Hudson tour- 
ing car in which Lotsey is said to 
have traveled to Atlanta is being 
held by the police. 

Lotsey, according to 8

70 DISBURSE BONUS 
WITHOUT TAX LEVY 


Calls for Payment With In- 


terest on Foreign Debts orf 
Sale of Bonds Issued! 


Against Principal 


United: States will pay a soldier bo- 
nus without one cent of additional 
taxation upon the people, under 
plans Republican leaders in congress 
were working on today. 


lection of the war debt principal. 

“The proposal that the foreign 
debt bé used to pay the bonus un- 
doubtedly will be adopted, if it proves 
feasible, and I believe it will,” Rep- 
resentative Fordney, chairman of the 
house ways and means committee, 
said. President H., Aing is in fa- 
vor of the plan and has personally 
commended it to the committee.“ 

First Step 

The first step in the bonus pro- 
gram will be the enactment of the 
foreign debt refunding bill, already 
passed by the house and shprtly to 
be taken up in the senate. On the. 
heels of the debt bill’s passage, the 
house will bring out the bonus meas- 


nue, merely stating that payments 


debt.. 

Under this plan, administration 
leaders doubt if payments of the 
bonus can be started before late next 
year. This. doubt arises from thé 
question of how long the commis- 
sion created by the foreign debt re- 
funding bill will need to whip the: 
debt into shape so that money. will 
start coming in. ‘ 

Sales Tax Advocates 

To pay.the bonus the commission 
would collect immediately as much 
of the debt interest, amounting to 
about two billion dollars, as the 
debtor nations were able to pay, and 
the restof tme bonus money would 
be raised through the sale of debt 
bonds. off 

A powerful attempt. will be made 
in both branches of congress to have 
the bonus money raised by a sales 
tax. Advocates of this tax contend 
that hooking the bonus up with the 
foreign debt puts the bonus on an 


extremely uncertain basis and will 
not guarantee payments. 


W. L. Payne, Ex-Sleuth, 
Is Denied New Trial by

W. L. Payne, former citv detec- 
tive under a chaingang sentence for 
bribery, was denied a new trial by

nounced that an appeal to the state 
court of appeals would be taken. 
Meanwhile, Payne will remain at

Immediately after his conviction 
several months ago Payne filed a

CABINET POSITION 


PARIS. Jan. 14.—(By the Asso- 
ciated Press. M. Poincare, in his

to succeed the Briand ministry, ask- 
‘ed former Premier Rene Viviani to 
accept the post of minister of jus- 
tice with the vice presidency of the 
cabinet, but M. Viviani refused the 
portfolio, it was officially announced 
this afternoon. 

Raymond Poincare gives his views 
on the Cannes conference in to- 
day’s Revue des Deux Mondes. 

While not an absolute opponent 
of commercial negotiations. with 
Russia, M. Poincare does not ap- 
prove of giving them “the solemn 
consecration of a conference to 
which the chiefs of all European gov- 
ernments are summoned, those of 
Russia and Germany in the front 
tank.” He continues: 

“Wilson was called an idealist and 
na dreamer. The covenant of the 
League of Nations, however defec- , 
tive, expressed at least some Precise 
ideas and in fact, despite the vegret - 
table defection of the Unite States, 
tha’ institution has not filed to 
render service. But, with the Genoa 
conference we plunge into the un- 
known.” 

With regard to reparaticns he 
writes: 

“It is much less important for us 
to receive tomorrow two or three

and the right to enforce its pay -

decision f Secretary. Weeks to put 
the question of acceptance or rejec--

This decision was announced by 
Secretary Weeks late yesterday aft-

Frederick Engstrum, of Wilming-

her conference delegation, agreed to- 
day to transfer to. China the admin-

also agreed today to hand over to

transfer is effected. 

Indications were apparent before

Back to Chattanooga With 
Request That Additional 
Money Be Sent Hum 


Detective Chief A. Lamar Poole 
Saturday morning gave the credit 
to Detective Chief Hackett, of Chat - 
tanooga for gathering the informa- 
tion that resulted in the capture of 
Frank B. DuPree, the Peachtree 
street’ bandit, in Detroit. 

When DuPree pawned the stolen 
ring in a Chattanooga pawnshop on 
the morning after his holdup of the 
Nat Kaiser jewelry store in Atlanta, 


pawnbroker was willing to advance 
on it. : eat 

The pawnbroker claims to have 
advanced him $495 and agreed to 
advance another $200 in thirty days 
if DuPree would sell the pawn ticket 
back to him. 

Detective Chief Hackett, it was 
stated by Chief Poole, waited and 
watched for DuPree to send the 
pawn ticket back to the pawnbroker, 
and back it came from Detroit with 
a request for thé pawnbroker to 
send him the remaining $200, as per 
agreement, to “F. B. Parker, care of

“This has béen the hardest chase 
I have encountered in my career,“ 
gaid J. A. Fraser, superintendent 
of the Atlanta office of the Pinker- 
ton National Detective agency. It 
lasted nearly a month, and hos cost 
our agency about $5,000. Our in- 
vestigations reached into Washing- 
ton, D. C., Norfolk; and New York 
City, as well as Atlanta, where the 
chase started, and Chattanooga, 
where the ring was pawned, and 
troit, where the capture was made. 

„I want to give full credit to 
Chief Poole, of Atlanta, who dug 
up the essential fact of DuPree’s 
alias of F. B .Parker, and to Chief 
Hackett, of Chattanooga, who sup- 
plied the information that DuPree 
would be looking for ah important 
letter at the Detroit postoffice, 
where our men got him. In fact, 
I want to say that our agency has 
received the most splendid co-opera- 
tion from police departments all

Mr. Fraser was in communication 
Saturday morning by long distance 
telephone with his agency’s office in 
Detroit, and was able to supply in- 
teresting facts as to DuPree's situ- 
ation and capture. 

“DuPree Was goin under the

found on his person or in his room 
at the Aragon hotel, Detroit.

DETROIT, Mich., Jag. 14.—Inter- 
rupting the sombre thoughts of @ 
self-confessed murderer at mid - 
night, Detectives last night removed 
Frank DuPree, alias J. P. Parker, 
alleged to have killed Irby C. 
Walker and ously wounded the 
city comptroller of Atlanta, from 
the solitary cénfinement of his ceil 
in central police station and sub-

DuPree continued willing to make

with ‘reiteratiig his former state-

cording to the police, he added some 
further details of his life since De- 
cember 15. when the murder was 
committed. 

Caubing a miniature panic in the 
crowd surrounding him, Detective 
Sergeants ‘william Collins and Paul

found to be unarmed. 

Prior to his confinement in a cell 
that is under the constant surveil-

gave his -statement to detective 
questioners and, according to their 
report, freely admitted he had shot 
Walker in the Nat Kaiser jewelry 
store in Atlanta.

Tou are free to speak or remain 
silent, and anything that you say 
may ba used against you,” the pris- 
oner was told. “What do you wish 
to do?“ 

“I think I'll tell you all about it,” 
was DuPree’s reply, and e ording 
to detective questioners he told the 
following story: 

“I bought a gun about December 
5, and later, Betty Andrews, a girl 
I met in Birmingham, stopped at the 
Kimball house, where I wag living. 
We were out ooking at u..nuond 


Kaiser’s. On December 15 I was 
just about broke, and wanted to get 
that ring for Betty, so I went into 
the store and asked the clerk to 
show it to me. He took it from the 
window and I grabbed it trom his 
hang. 
“This man Walker was standing 
near the door, and when I started 
to run out he blocked the way,, push- 
ing me half way back through the 
store and reaching for his gun. I 
had the automatic in my coat pock-

his heart I pulled the trigger twice.

daughter of the pawnbroker with 
whom he pawned the ring isd 
him to the railroad station and found 
that he bought a ticket to Norfolk, 
amd we have other evidence that he 
went there. 

The most recent . Chaitanooga 
phase of the case developed Friday 
merning when the pawnbroker re- 
eeived a registered letter from Do- 
treit, enclosing the pawn tieket and 
asking kira to send to F. B. Par- 
ker“ a: Detroit the $200 addition 1 
the pawnbroker had promised on the 
ring at the end of thirty days if 
Parker, or Dupree, were unable to 
redeem) it then and would give up 
the ticket, r 

The pawnbroker took the letter 
at once to Chief Hackett who com- 
municated with us by wire. I sent 
a long code message to Detroit, in- 
structing our men te look for Du- 
Pree at the postoffice and be re- 
pared for a battle. They found him 
right on schedule.” 

Another Murder Suspect 

That DuPree is the man who 
killed Charlie Crawford, a negro, 
when the latter went to the rescue 
of Jee Rubens, a grocer being heid 
up at Crew street and Woodward 
avenue, is the belief entertajned by 
Detective T. O, Sturdivant. 

. "A friend of DuPree has told me 
that DuPree admitted to him that 
he killed the negro,’’ said Detective 
Bturdivant Saturday morning. 

The killing of Charlie Crawford 
oceurred in November. Rubens was 
alone in his store on Saturday night 
and was Held up by a lone bandit. 
A small boy passing the store saw 
what was happening and ran around 
the corner giving the alarm, Charlie 
Crawford, who. operated a pressing 
club around the corner, was the first 
man the boy met. The negro grab- 
bed his gun and ran to the grocer’s 
Assistance, and as he entered the 
store he was shot through the heart 
by the bandit. 

A movement was started to ob- 
tain for the negro’s wife and two 
children a Carnegie hero medal re- 
ward, with a benefit fund, The At- 
lanta Retail Food Dealers’ ass‘ocia- 
tion also raised a benefit fund. 

: or DuPree‘s Return 

Chief Poole and J, A, Fraser. su- 
perintendent of the Atlanta branch 
of the Pinkerton agency, were to 
hold a conference Saturday morn- 
ing to make arrangements for the 
return of DuPree to Atlanta. 

It was not decided when this edi- 
tion of The Journal went to press 
whether Atlanta city detectives 
would go to Detroit for him, or 
Pinkerton detectives. In either 
event, Chief Poole stated, the utmost 
precautions would be taken to pre- 
vent DuPree’s escape. 

it was pro 
for DuPree would be obtained from 
Governor Hardwick, to ba used in 
Detroit in the event DuPree should 
resist extradition. 

The alias F. B. Parkers” seems 
to have been the one used by Du- 
Pree ever since he left Atlanta. It 
was the alias under which he di- 
rected Betty Andrews, his Atlanta 
girl, te communicate with him in 
Norfolk. She is a resident of the 
Childs hotel, and has told the police 
that she was acquainted with Du- 
Pree only a few days before he com- 
mitted the Nat Keiser holdup and 
murder. 

CITY TO PAY REWARD

The reward of $1,000 offered by

Peachtree bandit wil] be paid as

night by devious roads through thf

at the point of a gun to go slow in 
order to avoid all suspicion. Dypree 
said the driver’s name was Buckley, 
and that he was in no way impli- 
eated in the robbery: 

After reaching Chattancoga, Du- 
Pree said he id the driver and 
sent him homé, He related selling 
the ring in Silverman's pawn ghop 
and receiving $495 for the ring, val- 
ued at $1,8,00.. DuPree broke his 
story often with the question, “Did 
you hear anything from Chattango- 
ga yet? I read the accounts and 
they are. wrong,” 

Police believe that he was con- 
nected with some coup in that city 
and are awaiting the arrival of a 
special detective. 

Expects Death Sentence 

Atlanta detectives are also report: 
ed to be on their way to Detroit. 

“J never went around the jails 
much in Georgia. Is it the chair 
or the rope theres?“ he asked one 
of the détectives. 

“Well, I am ready to go back 
tonight and face the music,” he is 
said to have remarked at the con- 
clusion of the questioning. 

A search through his rooms at 
one of the smaller hotels revealed 
scraps of letters, on one of which he 
signed himself, “your friend, the 
lucky bandit, who has never been 
Caught,” | 

Another scrap of a letter was ad- 
dressed to an Atlanta newspaper, 
vaunting the fact that he had never 
been captured. 

“Lay low in Detroit—they don't 
know who you are there,” was the 
message on one note, unsigned, from 
Atlanta, . 

DuPree related, according to the 
police, that he had gone from 
Charleston te Norfolk and from 
there to Cincinnati. He said his 
real objective when he left the south 
was Detroit, 

Nanies of 19 Detroit families plan- 
ning to spend the winter in the 
south and. printed in one of the local 
newspapers were found carefully 
put away in DuPree’s et, He is 
said to have admitted planning to 
burglarize the listed homes, 

“How would yeu know where the 
houses are if, you. are a stranger 
here?“ DuPree was asked. ‘Well, 
I could ask @ policeman,” was the 
reply. 

One false move during the mid. 
night questioning indicated to po- 
lice that, despite hig air of resigna: 
tion, he but awaits the slightest 
chance to make his escape. On leav- 
ing the cell he was en by the 
arm by a detective and when he saw 
the door, symbolising te him a lost 
and probably never-to-be-found free- 

„ he jerked his arm almost free 
and then seemed to _ realize the 
futility of his effort with five patrol- 
men in the : 


Police anticipate trouble on the 
journey south and will take every 
precaution to see that escape is im- 

“All I want ie a fair deal and 1 
want the police patrol to meet the 
train when I get inte Atlanta,” was 
the final remark of DuPree as he 
was returned to the cell, according 
to his jailers.

POINCARE TO BRING 
GREAT AUTHORITY 
By Hiram K. -oderwell 
News--Copyrirht.: 1922.) 
Jan. 13,—(Delayed,).: 
Raymond Poincare, who. today ac 
cepted the task of forming a new 
cabinet, brings great authority, 
learning and pclitical skill to the 
rformance of this duty as well as 
riendship with men abroad, espe- 
cially in Great Britain, all of .which 
will be needed to repair the disas- 
trous position of France at this time. 
His position is extraordinarily diffi- 
cult. The national “bloc” which 
cwerthrew Briand was elected on a 
panicky anti-olshevist platform, re- 
gardiess of the complex economic ad- 
justments which it would face. 
M. Poincare, in the course ef hig 
long campaign against Briand, made 
romises of vigercur action against 
ermany which are now extremely 
dificult to carry out. His support- 
ers count most on his personal abil- 
i., to reach an agreement with Brit- 
ain, but it seems doubtful it he can 
obtain much mere than Briand: ac- 
eomplished as to France’s position 
in general European politics, 
Germans here are nervous over 
the situation. They even fear that 
the French will invade the Ruhr im- 
mediately. They claim that the 
Wirth ministry, the policy of which 
is callaboeraticn wity France, must 
fall. But Germany must now be 
granted a delay on the January 
reparations pay. “ts despite the 
French protest. The situation is 
complex, but it can be gaid that the 
supreme council—the guarantor of 
the-treaty of Versailles—~has ceased 
to exist, at least for the present.

. he hearing of arguments 
for and against a permanent in-

by Judge’ Sibley 2 week after the 
issuance of the temporary order. 
From the qutget of the hearing, 
all three judges exhibited the keen- 
est interest in the case, particularly 
Judges Bryan and Jack, to whom 
all of it was new. The judges al- 
lowed each side one hour and thirty 
minutes to present the case. 
It was made plain. by Attorney 
Rosser, representing the power 
company, that the company, not 
only was asking the federal court to 
restrain the commission from re- 
ducing the rate from $1.65 to $1.65, 
but also would probably ask the 
court to dilow the company to in- 
crease the rate to 32 per 1;000 cubic

plied that it was $5,260,000. Attor-

claimed and insisted on a valuation 
of $9,000,000 for rate- making pur-

The present agitation for more

clared, be a calamity to the state 
and to the industry to establish 
any more until dairying ts devel- 
oped more. Let Georgia take warn-

for Gude’s Pepto-Mangan and take 
it with your meals for a few weeks

If you are pale, tired, lack ambi-* 
tion and vigor, you know yourself 
that if you had plenty of red blood 
that you would not feel tired and 
half sick all the time. The only 
sure foundation of permanent health 
is good blood. Gude's Pepto-Man- 
gan builds up your blood with a 
form of iron that gets into your 
sysicm quickly. It is wonderful. 
You will 
feel so well and strong. Life will be

In a stirring appeal or a spirit of 
friendly co-operation “confidence 
in the police department as well as 
other departments of thé city gov- 


e t, the Committee on Church 
C ration on Saturday issued a 
statement in which it “knocks. the 
knocker,” and urged council to sup- 
port the officers of the law with men 
and material. ; . * 

The statement follows: 

“No officer shall speak discouragingly to 
his mate, either on the watch or at mess, 
concerning the business on which he is or 
may be engaged.“ . 

Phat rule of the British navy, called to 
eur attention by the Christian Century, 
might well be adopted by us today, 
called the law against knocking.“ 

In the American ship of state, and in 
the great fleet of states and cities with 
that ship, all are officers, h some 
ma be temporarily in command, while otb- 
ers serve in the ranks. And we are en- 
gaged in the greatest business“ the world 
has ever seen, the business of building a 
Mation governed not by a king, nor by a 

_ few, but by all for the good dt all. 

Knocking, discouraging talk, may destroy 
the whole. 

Confidence is needed. Confidence is only 
another name for faith. Mountains melt 
before faith. But mole4ilis become im- 
passable mountains to those whose faith in 
themselves, or in others, or in both, has 
broken down beneath the knocker’s blows. 

Eighty per cent of the present unemploy- 
ment, business depression, slackness of la- 
bor, and wave ef crime, we believe, is due 
to lack ef faith and discouragement created 
by ‘lacking tongues, which have nothing 
but suspicion, fear and distrust to offer. 

od’s Faith in Us 

God's abiding faith in man and his fu- 
ture was shown by His Son coming into the 
world as Jesus, the Carpenter. And this 
Carpenter, the Christ, gave the only plan 
by which we may hope to succeed in our 
venture. That plan calls for faith, hope 
end love. . 
‘Faith in God, our country, and our fel- 
bowman. Faith, so confident of the future, 
that it will put dollars into brain and brawn 
building homes, factories and stores, mining 
the earth, cültivating the fields, belting the 
world with electricity and rails of steels, 
and girdling the globe with ships. Faith 
putting whole hearts into the work of the 


ay. 

And hope. Hope, which seeing God's guid- 
ing hand in all, and the good in man, looks 
for’ the rich rewards of faith and the dawn 
shown by all history ever 
268.” 


ch both faith apd 


of better days, 
following the darkest 

And love, without w 
hope are dead and useless things. Love 
not only willing to offer all for country int 
the glamor of war. when applauding thou- 
@ands may see, but ready, when only Ged 
may know, to sacrifice the sole remaining 
dollar, the uttermost urge of muscle, and 
the last grasp of breath to save the life of 
@ woman or child, and shield them from 
suffering, or worse than death. 
Love willing to sacrifice personal comfort 
and convenience, not only in the big things 
of life, but in the little things for the good 
of all. 

Such faith, hope and love will enable us 


to succeed. 
’ Things That Count 

It would seem that the little things are 
the mosg important. 

Few are called to play a great part upon 
the national stage of life. But to, each of 
us comes the daily call for faith, Hope, and 
love in the home, the place of business, and 
in the community upon which three the whole 
of our national life depends. And in the 
home, the place of business, and the com- 
munity, more than anywhere _ else, we 
Should follow the rule: 

No officer shall speak discouragingly 
to his mate.”’ 

But ‘this rule means neither the hiding 
nor neglect of disagreeable facts, rather the 
deliberate facing and handling of such facts 
with intelligence and faith. 

Recently, a man damned the whole police 
department of the city of Atlanta. To him, 
the situation seemed hopeless, 

In the last few days, he aid, 
stood upon a street corner, wiere he bad 
watched a blind-tiger openly peddimg flasks 
of liquor. while a policemaa stood Ly look- 
ing on. It did not occur to the man that 
he as a cjtizen. in failing to report the po- 
liceman the chief of police, was as much 
at fault as was the policeman.

Let's face the facts, bat eut, ont the 
knocking. 

Facing the Facts 

Conditions in Atlanta are not what they 
Should be. To answer, saying that condi- 
tions are just as bad in otner cities, and 
pointing to the world-wile wave of crime, | 
gets us nowhere. It ‘vould still he un to 
Atlanta to clean ber sxirts. Moreover,.pub- | 
lished murder statistics put Atlanta im the 
unenviable position of being the third most 
dangerous city in the Liilted States ip) 
which to live: and this was before the cum- , 
wlative horrors of the last few months. 

Memphis came first in 1920 with a mur- 

der rate of 64.5 per 100,000. Savannah fol. 
lowed with a rate of 44. Atlanta came next 
with a rate of 40, then Charleston with 36. 
Chicago. reputed to be the worst of the 
great metropolitan cities, hac a rate of 
only 7.2 per 100,000, while the rate in New 
York was 5.9; in Buffalo, 4.1; Newark 3.4; 
Milwaukee, 3; Rochester, 1.3. 

At once the presence of the negro will 
be offered as an excuse. Unt bath Chi- 
cago and New York have huge argre popu. 
lations. Furthermore, for several Fears 
mast, law-abiding negroes in Atlantg have 

q — begging fer police protection agutust 
criminals ‘in negro sections. And adequate 
protection has not been given. The excuse 
for failing to give this has been the lack of 
enough policemen to cover the city. 

Since 1912, the chief of police has been 
wre ng an increase of the force. This rec- 
emimendation bas been repeatedly ignored. 
Now it would seem, the force is to be in- 
creased. When this is done, and the rec- 
ommendations of the police department are 
fully carried out, the chief and the force 
can realize that they have tbe“sympathy 
and support of the law-abiding citizens of 
Atlanta behind them in the enforcement of 


the law. 
Every Atlantan’s Business 

The chief is the head of the police force. 
The people have the right to look to him. 
If there are any weak spots in the depdrt- 
gent, it is up to the chief to get rh of 
them. If any obstacle is placed in the way 
ef the chief, he has only to make that ob- 
stacie known and the public wilt see that 
it is removed. 

Atlanta looks to the city council to give 
to he police department vvery ;eeded man 
and every needed facility: Then Atlanza has 
the right to expect the chief and 

rtment to make an end of the 
. situation. 

Unemployment will neither explain nor 
excuse the situation. 

There was no serious unemployment in 
6, 1920, the year covered by the statistics 
" quoted above. Moreover, today the city 

warden, the Associated Charities, and the 

churches stand ready to bp any individ- 

ual or family in need. No one in Atlanta 

has to commit crime to get needed food, 

clothes, or fuel, All that Is necessary is to 
the wan 


nown c. 

“pag CT chhrches and individuals are 
working to give jobs to all. Fer it is real- 
ized that no henest man or woman, willing 
to work, should be forced to 3

For Jan. 15—I Kings 18. 
BY DR. MARION MH. HULL 


GOLDEN TEXT: “This is the vie- 


even our faith.” I Jno. 5:4. 


When God hides a man his ene- 
mies can not find him. Ahab had 
been looking for Elijah in every 
country he could think of, and when 
he had not been able to find him 
there he had taken a pledge of the 
king that he knew nothing of his 
wher :abcuts. 1 the time Elijah 
had been safely hidden and amply 
provided tor every ay by God, at 
the brook Cherith and then in the 
widow's home in Zarephath: Ahab 
wanted him because he was laying 
the blame for their present condi- 
tion of fire famine on Elijah, not 
realizing that he himself was the 
trouble of Israel. It is so natural 
to blame ether people, and has been 
ever since Adam blamed Eve. 


After three years, God told Elijah 
to get out of his retirement and to 
go and show himself to Ahab. If 
Elijah even guessed the danger of 
such a proceeding, he did not hesi- 
fate a moment, but started right 
back to Samaria. On the way he 
met Obadiah. Ahab and Obadiah 
had go out on a hunt for water 
and to keep all of the royal 
stock from starving to death. Oba- 
diah was the governor of Ahab's 
heuse, his prime minister. He was 
a-man who feared the Lord greatly, 
and had shown it by secretly hiding 
and providing for 100 of the Lord's 
prophets when Jezebel had given 
the order for all of them to be slain. 
In spite of this it is hard to see 
how he himself had escaped Jezebels 
sword if he had stel out four- 
square for God in that heathen 
court. It is but another evidence 
of Ahab’s strange duplicity—prob- 
ably the worst king of Israel in 
leading Israel into idolatry and yet 
naming all of his children after Je- 
hovah, and selecting as his prime 
minister a man who feared Jeho- 
vah greatly! Obadiah, however, was 
out of-place, he would have been far 
more true to God if he had cut loose 
from all of those heath n associa- 
tions. 5 

a Elijah Meets Ahab 

Ahab and Obadiah divided the 
land between them, and on the 
way, Elijah met Obadiah, and was 
recognized by him. Obadiah was 
panic-stricken when Elijah told him 
to go tell his lord Ahab, “Behold, 
Elijah.” He knew how much Ahab 
wanted Elijah; he knew how hard 
he had searched for him; he knew 
how angry hob would be if Elijah 
slipped from his fingers and he 
knew his own life would be taken if 
he gave such a message and then 
did not find Elijah when he came— 
and Obadiah was reasonably sure 
the Spirit of God would carry Eli- 
jah out of Ahab’s grasp. This in- 
dicates that impression about Eli- 


d Israel was just »pping. from 
one twig to anot r. No wonder the 
p ple Ww. sil nt, ard answer.d 
not a rd. >t was neither indiffer- 
ence, ncr disgust on ther p.rt. but 
a tonishment and ignorancc. They 
had no vonception of what God plan- 
ned for them. If that question ei 
asked you, could you answer a word? 
2 u boppi. g frum one twig to 
another like . bird, or are you soar- 
ij int. God's heights as He intend- 
ed you sHculd? 

Teis © > used E ifah to issue a chal- 

e. He wag one against fcur hun- 
dred and fifty. He would put a bul- 
lock on the altar and put no fire un 
der. They would put another bul- 
lock on an altar and put no fire un- 
der. Then the god who gnswered 
by fire should be their god. The 
people accepted the challenge; it was 
fair they thought, and they had no 
doubt of the outcome, for Boal was 
the sun-god; everything was as 
dry as a chip from the three and one 
half years’ drought; surely Boal 
would answer by fire. 

Elijah gave them the first chance. 
After the bullock had been placed on 
the altar, they cried: “O Boal, hear 
us.” That dismal cry kept up from 
morning until noon; the priests leap- 
ing on the altar they had made. 
Then Elijah began to mcck them, 
He suggested that they cry louder 
if that were possible, that Boal must 
be taking a nap, or talking to some- 
one, else, or perhaps was off on a 
journey. In their frenzy they cut 
themselves with knives; but to no 
avail. The intense heat of the noon- 
day sun on tcp of Carmel had come 
and gone; it was getting toward 
evening and not a splinter had 
been lighted. 


Then about the time cf the even 
ing sacrifice, Elijah began. He first 
repaired the altar that Jezebel had 
broken down. ‘He took twelve stones. 
for each tribe a stone, to show that 
the nation was one,, nct divided as 
it was then. Since he was to offer 
sacrifice to God, he must do it in 
God’s way. Then he put wood on the 
altar and afterward the slain bullock. 
He wanted to make the people sure, 
so he had them pour twelve barrels 
of water on the weod and offering 
ahd fill a trench around the altar. 
Then in marked contrast to the fren- 
zied cries of the prophets of Boal he 
spoke to God—he had been long ac- 
customed to speaking with God, and 
this gives us some idea as to how 
he prayed and why God of Abraham, 
Isaac, and Israel (not Jacc b, notice, 
but Israel, for it was to Israel that 
He had made the promises). He 
pleaded for God’s glory—he asked 
that the people might know that 
Jehovah was God, and that he, Eli- 
jah, had just done these things not 
of his cwn notion, but because Jeho- 
vah had told him to do them. He 
wanted Israel to know that God 
was still gracious and “has turned 
their heart back.” He is so sure of 
the answer and result that he uses 


jah that was curren‘ in court cir- 
cles. He was supposed to be living 
a charmed life. As-a matter of fact 
he was; but the same kind of charm- 
ed life that you may live today if 
you are in close fellowship with 
God. He will keep you, too; you 
are invulnerable until your work is 
done. Elijah, however,, reassured 
him: “As Jehovah of hosts liveth, 
before whom L stand, I will surely 


jah was not afraid of Ahab, for he 
was still standing in the presence 
of Jehovah. When he appeared 
first he had said, As Jehovah God 
of Israel liveth, before whom, I 
tand, (1 Kings 17:1); this time it 
is “As Jehovah of hosts liveth be- 
fore whom I stand.” It was his re- 
lationship to God, standing in His 
presence, that made Elijah the man 
he was. It was Jehovah's different 
relationships that made his mes- 
sages vibrant with power. Jehovah 
God of Israel stops the rain because 
Israel needs to know they have for- 
saken Him for other gods that are 
not gods at all. Jehovah of hosts 
gives courage to Elijah who fears 
therefore nothing from all the hosts 
of Ahab. 
S0 Elijah meets Ahab, not only un- 
afraid but absolute master of the 
situation. He not only denies the 
accusation of Ahab, but boldly ace 
cuses the king himself of being the 
cause of all of Israel’s present dis- 
tress. And then he orders Ahab to 
gather all Israel and the prophets 
of Boal and the prophets of the 
groves to him—to Elijah, on Mt. 
Carmel! And Ahab obeys! The ob- 
scure pronhe* of God has the power- 
ful and luxury-loving king execut- 
ing his orders like a lackey! 

The day has come; all Israel is 
gathered tcgether on Mount Carmel; 
the pecple and the king are in sym- 
pathy with the prophets of Boal. Eli- 
jah stands alone, ye. in the majority 
for God and one make a majority. 

He addresses the people: How long 
will. you continue to sop from one 
twig to another? If Tehovah be God 
then follow Him; if Boal 1 , 
then follow him.

His question represented them as 


, twig to another. but unable to soar 
into the blue as they would if they 
were not wounded. God wanted Is- 


the past tense, speaking of the peo- 
ple’s conversion as though it had 
already been accomplished. The es- 
sential elements in Elijah’s prayer 
were faith in the ccvenant-keeping 
God, a desire for God’s glory, and 
that humanity which relegated self 
to the background. These elements 
in your prayer will make you as 
fruitful in prayer as Elijah. 


They were fully. awarded. Fire 
from Jehovah came down imme- 
diately and did a thorough werk— 
sacrifice, wood, stones, water and 
dust were consumed. The effect on 
the people was over-powering, they 
cried out “Jehovah, he is God; Je- 
hovah, he is God.” Elijah took ad- 
vantage of it at once and had them 
arrest all. the prophets of Boal, take 
them down the mountain-side to the 
brook Kishon and slay them there. 
And then he announced to Ahab: 
“Get thee up, eat and drink, for 
there is a sound of abundance of 
rain.“ As a matter of fact, there 
was not a cloud in the sky; it was 
still as clear as it had been for 
three and one-half years; there was 
not a drop of moisture in the at- 
mosphere; but Elijah knew that 
such repentance en the part of the 
people would make it easy for him 
to pray for rain and get it quickly. 
Nor was his faith unrewarded. While 
Ahab was eating and drinking, Eli- 
jah was on his\knees on top of Car- 
mel, and on the seventh trip his 
servant came back to report a little 
cltud the size of a man’s hand. He 
stopped praying then and urged 
Ahab to hurry before the rain could 
stop him. While he, the prophet of 
Jehovah, who had been complete 
master of the situation, now skhcws 
his humility and loyalty to the king 
— running before him as his cou- 

er! : 


Did Elijah have any right to put 
such a test? Had he the right td 
expect that God would answer by 
fire? Surely he did. And others 
have the right today te expect some- 
thing in you that can not be ex- 
plained in any other way to show 
them that Jehovah is God. No 
Wonder so many are not believing 
Him when they see so meny whe 
claim to be His followers, bought 
by His precious blood, redeemed 
from the power of Satan, and yet 
who are so like the devil’s con that 
one can not tell them. apart ex-

the annual banauet of the “Atlanta

mately 500 members of B. Y. P. U.’s

for a pep“ 


A casual observer 


meeting at some big co-educational 


school. 


There were yells and cheers. 
thin, penetrating blasts from shrill 
tin horns and all the other noises 
that would characterize such an as- 
semblage. 

With all the noise it would have 
been impossible to have any 
speeches, so those in charge very 
wisely decided to dispense with the 
oratorical efforts that are usually 
made after a big banquet. So there 
were no speeches—with two very im- 


portant ‘exceptions, , 


One of the exceptio was when 
Frank H. Hooper, Jr., vice president 
of city organization, who presided, 
announ the annual training 
school which is scheduled to begin 
at the Baptist Tabernacle on Sunday 
and last throughout next week. This 
banquet was in reality the first gun 
in a campaign for a 100 per cent at- 
tendance at this school and all pres- 
ent were urged to attend. 

The other exception was when 
Carlton W. Ninns, president, pre- 
sented Frank H. Leavell, former 
state field secretary for the B. Y. P. 
U. ig Georgia, who resigned his post 
recently to becéme student enlist- 
ment secretary of the Southern Bap- 
tist convention, with two handsome 
silver candlesticks as tokens of the 
esteem in which he and Mrs. Leavell 
are held by the Atlanta city union. 
Mr. Leavell responded with a short 
speech of thanks and the meeting 
adjourned. ° . : 

Music for the occasion was fur- 
nished by the Tech High band, while 
vocal solos were rendered by Paul 
Crutchfield and John Hoffman, and 
a violin solo by Miss Lilouise Smith.

Notices Must Be in

Several notices of church serv-

for .insertion 


A decision in the par ‘clearance 
case which ended late Friday is ex- 
pected to be handed down by United 
States Judge Beverly D. Evans 
shortly. after February 1. Judge 
Evans took the case under advise- 
ment at the conclusion of the hear - 


ins and left tor his home in Savan- 


nah Friday nignt. 

The case involves litigation insti- 
tuted by the American Bank and 
Trust company of Cordele and more 


than ,200 other state banks in the 


effort to enjoin the Sixth Federal 
Reserve bank from enforcing the 
par clearance rule. 

The reserve bank has contended 
that under the federal reserve act 
it cannot pay the exchange fee” 
claimed by state banks on remit- 
tances. The fee in question is the 
one charged on transactions between 
different banks and does not in- 
volve the fee charged by banks 
against checks presented by their 
patrons against banks on vother 
cities. | 

The litigation was begun in Jan- 
vary 20,“ when the state banks in- 
stituted the injunction proceedings. 
At the first hearing, Judge Evans, 
presiding for Judge Samuel H. Sib- 


‘ley, who was disqualified, dismissed 


the proceedings, holding that the 
presentation of a check for payment 
to the bank on which it was drawn 
was at all times a legal act and 
could not be construed as coercion. 

The case was appealed to the cir- 
cuit court of appeals which upheld 
Judge Evans. It was then carried 
to the United States supreme court, 
which sheld that the presentation of 
such checks could become illegal if 
performed in such a manner as to 
impose a hardship on the state 
banks and ordered a rehearing on 
the merits of the case. 

The second hearing has been in 
progress since Monday. The reserve 
bank was represented by John W. 
Davis, of New York, former ambas- 
sador to Great Britain, and Hollins 
Randolph and Robert.S. Parker, of 
Atlanta. Judge Alex Smith, of 
Smith, Hammond & Smith, was asso- 
ciated with Orville Parker, of Ma- 
con, as counsel for the state banks. 

Judge Evans’. ruling in the case 
will be awaited with much interest 
as it concerns such a large num- 
ber of banks. The issue has at- 
tracted nation wide attention. One 
Oregon banker, who is interested in 
instituting similar proceedings, 
came all the way to Atlanta to testi- 
fy, but his testimony was ruled out 
by Judge Evans, who held that the 
issue involved only banks in the 
Sixth district.

Chief Beavers Replies 
To Department Critics 
In Civitan Address 


That a large part of the criticism 
being heaped on the police and de- 
tective departments is coming from 
cheap politicians” who wish to use 
the two departments as stepping — 
stones to office, was the statement 
made by Chief of Police James L. 


The simple affair i 
sive and the streets crowded on 
happy contrast. Outside people were 
shouting ‘‘Hooray for Charlie!“ 
yhile inside souls were hushed in 
grief. | 

Such a discordant ‘note. I wished 
I had not been so prominent. I 
wanted every one to bow in respect 
to these dead. The crowds did not 
belong outside. 


And inside, on the little ehildren’s 
faces, I could see conflicting emo- 
tions. There is the reverence for the 
dead and yet there is eagerness as 
they steal glances at me. I wish 1 
hadn't come. I feel that I am the 
disturbing element. 

Among the Wounded 

From the school Sir Philip and 1 
went to the Star and Garter hospital 
r wounded soldiers. Sheer tragedy 
was here. 

Young men suffering from spinal 
wounds, some of them with legs 
withered, some suffering from shell 
shock. No hope for them, yet. they 
smiled. 

There was one whose hands were 
all twisted and he was painting signs 
with a brush held between his teeth. 
I looked at the signs. They were 
mottoes Never Say Die.” “Are We 
Downhearted?” A superman. 

Here is a lad who must take an 
anaesthetic wherever his nails are 
cut because of his twisted limbs. 
And he is smiling and to all appear- 
ances happy. The capacity that God 
gives for suffering is so tremendous. 
i marvel at their endurance. ; 

I inquire about food and general 
conditions. They suggest that the 
food could be better. This is at- 
tended to. ‘ 


Given a Boisterous Welcome 

We are received politely and with 
smiles from the cnippled ids who 
are crippled in flesh only. Their 
spirit is boisterous. I feel a puny 
atom as they shout “Good luck to 
you, Charlie.” : 

I can’t talk. There is nothing for 
me to say. I merely smile and nod 
and shake hands whenever this is 
possible. I sign autographs for as 
many as ask and I ask them to give 
me théir autographs. I honestly 
want them. 

One jovially says, Sure, and Bill 
will give you one, too.” There is an 
uproar of laughter and Bill laughs 
just as loud as the rest. .Bill has no 
arms. 

But he bests them. He will sign at 
that. And he does. With his teeth. 
Such is their spirit. What is to be- 
come of them? That is up to you 
and me. 

Back to Sir Philip’s, very tired and 
depressed. We dine late and I go 
to my room and read Walda Franks 
Dark Mothers.“ The next day there 
is tennis and music and in the eve- 
ning I leave for London, where I am 
to meet H. G. Wells and go with him 
to his country home. 

Meets Wells for a Holiday 

I am looking forward to this Sat- 
urday, Sunday and Monday as an m- 
tellectual holiday. I meet H. G. at 
Whitehall and he is driving his own 
car. He is a very good chauffeur, 
too. ‘

English Girls Enter 
Competition for Men 
Of Eveless Eden, S.C 


GREENVILLE, S. C., Jan. 14.— 
The ame of Donalds, the town noted 
for the absetice of marriageable wom- 
en, has spread to London, England, 
and the bachelors of Donalds say 
that the women ot / Chicago and other 
cities, who are planning to invade the 
Eveless Eden may face the competi- 
tion of English girls. 

Following a newspaper story about 
Donalds, proposals and requests to 
correspond with the bachelors came 
from girls in many states. The 
bachelor population immediately 
took a new lease on life and “love 
letters“ now being exchanged 
promise to culminate in happy 
romances. 

When news of the Eveless Eden 
drifted to London, another situation 
more interesting than ever ,develop- 
ed, and beaux are reported to be for- 
saking their American friends to 
start a “crush” on English girls, 
from whom they received letters.

DeKalb County's Progress : 


NE of the mast pregressive steps in 
Georgia agriculture within 


years is the movement launched by 
DeKalb county dairymen and business men 
to produce in that county the feedstuffs 
consumed by the county’s dairy herds. . 
An interesting account of the movement 


was written for The Journal by Mr. Ralph fas Secretary Weeks described it.. It affords 


Smith, whose illuminating articles on all 
phases of Georgia agriculture are attracting 
attention throughout the State. 

DeKalb county is situated within an 
hour’s motor drive of a city of more than 
250,000 population. Enormous quantities 
ef food are daily consumed in this city, and 
one of its largest items of daily food con- 
sumption is milk. It is natural, therefore, 
that DeKalb county should develop a large 
dairy industry.. 

DeKalb county dairy herds, it is esti- 
mated, consume from thirty-five to fifty 
tons of feedstuffs a day. A very small per- 
centage of this is raised within the county. 
The bulk of it comes from western states 
‘hundreds of miles away. The price is high 
and the freight rate ia high. ! 

A calculation recently made by DeKalb 
county business men showed that the freight 
charges on ‘feedstuffs consumed by the 
county’s dairy herds will amount to more 
than $175,000 a year. This astonishing 
figure is important not only to the dairy- 
men of. DeKalb county, but to the consum- 
ing public of Atlanta, for it shows how 
direct is the relation of freight rates to the 
cost of living. It probably would not . 
exaggeration to say that- every quart of 
milk bought by Atlanta housewives is dl- 
rectly increased in price by the freight 
rate paid on feedstuffs. 

DeKalb county dairymen and business 
leaders propose to put & stop to this eco- 
nomic waste., If the freight charges alone 
were $175,000 on the county's dairy feed- 
stuffs, the cost of the feedstuffs themselves 
is several times that amount—the exact 
figure not being available. 

The movement has been launched to raise 
in DeKalb county the feedstuffs consumed 
by DeKalb county dairy herds. Qualified 
authorities have advised the leaders of the 
movement that the county can produce them 
all, in abundant quantity and of quality as 
good as the western feeds. The money 
DeKalb county is paying to the west and 
paying in transportation charges will be 
kept at home. 
county, increasing its prosperity in all di- 
rections. Farmers not engaged in the dairy 
business can raise feedstuffs for those who 
are, and will be encouraged to do 60. 

This is practical and concrete aplica- 
tion of the co-operative farming idea. It 
fa entirely feasible. The manifest econo- 
mies that are to be gained by such a pro- 
gram are 80 substantial that it surely can- 
not fail to enlist the co-operation of the en- 
tire farming interests of the county.

maneuvers were to be conducted in every 
form of attack and defense known. te modern 
land warfare. t 

When the war ended, many members of 
the House and Senate wanted to sell Camp 
Benning and do away with the schoo! of arms. 
Secretary Weeks, then a member of the Sen- 
ate, was one of the leaders in the move- 
ment to abelish the camp. Senstor Hoke 
pmith, then ably engaged in representing 
Georgia's interests ag a member of the Sen- 
ate,, with ‘Senator Harris and the Georgia 
Congressmen, aggressively resisted the move- 
ment, and finally won their fight. 

Events have abundantly vindicated the 
wisdom of the , War Department in recom- 
mending the retention of Camp Benning. 
Every committee of Army officers sent to 
Camp Benning during the controversy went 
back with strong reports in favor of reten- 
tion. Secretary Weeks, though vigorously 
favoring the sale of the camp, completely 
changed his mind when he went to see it. 
Camp Benning has been of wonderful help 
to Columbus in the business depression, but 
that phase is transitory and relatively un- 
important. Columbus people are proud of 
the camp because of its impoftance as one of 
the “great military assets of our country,” 


them pleasure to give hospitable greetings 
and entertainment to the men stationed there 
and the government officials visiting the 
camp. — . 

Georgia as a whole should be proud of 
Camp Benning, and Georgians when travel-

On November 3, at Omaha, Nebraska, Bert 
Acosta established a new ‘speed record for a 
closed course, by driving a Curtiss machine. 
at an average speed of 176.7 miles per hour 
for a distance of 150 miles in the Pulitzer 
trophy race. ‘ 

These three notable records culminated on 
Dece.nber 29 in a n.ost amazing non-stop 
record by Edward Stinson and L’oyd Bertaud. 
formerly of the Army Flying Corps, who 
drove an American-made monoplane designed 
from a German machine for a continuous 
period of 26 hours, 19 minutes and 35 sec- 
onds. | 

Their flight was two hours and 28 seconds 
longer than the previous longest flight, which 
was made by Broussoutrut and Bernard, 
French flyers, in France in June, 1920. 

Although no re:ord was kept by Stinson 
and Bertaud of ‘he distance they covered, 
it was estimated that they flew” at least 
2,500 miles, based upon the amount of fuel 
consumed and record: of their speed. - 

During a part „. their flight they drove at 
a speed of ninety-five miles an hour against 
a gale blowing seventy miles an hour, in a 
blinding snowstorm, at a temperature below 
zero, with snow and hall and oil from their 
motor tearing at their faces, practically blind- 
ing them. 

Their flight of more than twenty-six hours. 
covering 2,500 miles, was longer than Hawk- 
er’s flight from Newfoundland to Ireland. It 
was longer than the trans-Atlantic flight of 
the late Captain Alcock and Lieutenant Ar- 
thur W. Brown. It was longer than the 
flight of the United States Navy aviators 
across the Atlantic, : a

THE MENTALLY DULL 
By H. Addington Bruce 


ROM personaj observation and the 
tenor of letters coming to-me, it is 
evident that there-still are people who 
labor under the -delusion that because a 
child is mentally dull in school he must of 
necessity have some innate brain deficiency. 
Otten, t is unfortunately true, mental 
dullness ig indeed an indication of an ir- 
remediable brain weakness. But far oftener 
it is nothing of the sort, In the great ma- 
jority of cases it ig the product of conditions 
eminently curable, especially if promptly as- 
certained. a 
To enumerate some of the commoner of 
these conditions, for the benefit of parents 
who may needlessly be tormenting themselves 
about their children’s mental state, and also 
for the benefit of the children themselves 
through helping to secure for them proper 
treatment; 
* Malnutrition is 1 frequent care of mental 
duliness. And malnutrition—note this well 
—-may result fron overfeeding or wrong: 


| feeding, no less than from underfeeding. 


There are many children stigmatized as 
mentally dull who need only to be put on a 
sensible diet to improve remarkably in men- 
tal power. 

Mental duliness may also be synonymous 
merely with weak, tired, over-strained eyes. 
For many a child a visit to a good ocalist 
has meant a prompt increase in ability te 
study to advantage. 


wits noticeably Larpened through treatment 
by an ear specialist, Helped to overcome 
unsuspected defects in hearing, their stu- 
pidity is soon found te have been more seem- 
ing than real. 

They did not study well because they could 
not well hear what was told them in the 
schoolroom. Also because they had to strain 
to hear, their attention was unduly taxed, 
their brain fdtigued rapidiy, they quickly 
forgot all they tried to learn, 

Brain fatigue, attention impairment, weak- 
ness of memo result in ether cases from 
poverty or polsoning of the blood. supplied 
to the brain, as % result perhaps of nasal 
obstruction, perhaps of infected tonsils or 
adenoid growths, perhaps of dental disease. 
These are possibilities which always ought to 
be reckoned with, when it is a question of 
dealing with a little dullard. 

So is the possibility that unfortunate con- 
ditions in the home may be responsible for 
the dullness. 

Children permitted or obliged to sleep in 
rooms having little or no ventilation are 
likely to be exceedingly poor scholars. Nor 
is any higher degree of scholarship to be ex- 
pected from children allowed to stay up late 
at night, taking part in festivities, the fam- 
ily life, ete. 

Such children are of necessity in a chronic 
state of overfatigue, handicapping them in 
all their school work. The same is true of 
those unfortunate children who are set at 
exhausting tasks before and after school 
hours. 

Children have actually been obseryed . to 
fall asleep in class, not because they are 80 
dull that class work fatigues them to exhaus- 
tion, but because they have been overworked 
outside of school or been deprived of their 
due allowance of sleep. As a natural conse- 
quence they have not been distinguished for 
scholarship. , , 

Thus, in fine, there should never be a 
hasty reaching of the verdict, “This child is 
mentally short.” Seek first some other expla- 
nation of the child’= dullness. The chances 
are that an adequate one will be forthcom- 
ing.

BRILLAT SAVARIN 
By Dr. Frank Crane 


They are erecting a monument in the city 
of Belley, in France, to a gentleman by th 
name of Brillat Savarin. | 

He deserves it. 

For he is the great authority on cooking. 

He is a man of one book, The Physiology 
of Taste,“ and owes his fame to it as Fitz- 
gerald owes his to the one poem he translat- 
ed, The Rubaiyat” of Omar Khayyam, and 
as Mrs. Stowe is immortal because of her one 
volume, Uncle Tom's Cabin.“ 

Civilization is simply the progress of man 
away from the beast. It is the spiritualiza- 
tion of the animal. And as long a’ we are 
animals still, whatever can idealize and 
beautify our animalities should be consider- 
ed a civilizing force. 

Among such forces good cooking is not the 
least. The animal bolts his food to satisfy 
his hunger. The human being ought to taste 
his food to satisfy not only his hunger but 
his aesthetic nature. 

Those who despise feeding and think that 
it is superior to give themselves entirely to 
reading books and 1 pi¢tures are mis- 
taken. They forget that we must feed. And 
the art of life is to refine the thiigs we must 
do. It is to make the fundamental and irre- 
sistible instincts charming, 

Brillat Savarin is the foremost French- 
man who excelled in that direction where the 
French people, as a rule, excel. 

His book is worth reading, both from a lit- 
erary point of view and from the standpoint 
of those who say with Terence, “I am a man, 
and nothing that is human is alien to me.” 

Brillat Savarin left France during the 
revolution and went to America, where he 
taught French and showed chefs how to cook. 
When he returned to his native country from 
bis exile he wrote: : : 

“Ah! te revoila, my sweet country, where 
i shall once more find the unique wines of 
Bordeaux and Burgundy, truffles; the tender 
lettuce, the gourmands decure, the poulards 
de bresse, the gourmands bernardins, and the | 
bonnes menageres! Many have sung thine 
artistic and scientific glory. too long ab- 
sence hath taught me that _ terrestrial, 
gifts are equal to thy spiritual. I would cele- 
brate the riches of thy vines, of thy fields, of 
they woods, of thy rivers, of thy hills, of thy 
orchards, and teach people how to enjoy 

* 


them.“ 
illustrious author of 


Thus wrote the 
“Tubot a la Vapeur“ in the volume which 
made him the poet of the table, of the kitch- 
en and of the cellar. 

Not the least significant, although its sig- 
nificance would be lost to a Frenchman, is 


the fact that this monument to him is to be 


set up in the place where he was born. ‘ 
And the name of that place is Belley.

riously like a new star upon the medt- 


theory, Such as that which claims, that if we 
only congume enough vitamines health is 
ours, but more often than not it is a de- 
structive theory which attacks some obscure 
and apparently unimportant portion of the 
human anatomy as being responsible for all 
the physical ills of the race. 


ply of blood was supposed to be the cause of 
all complaints, and the way to cure anything 
and everything was by the bleeding proe- 
ess, In more recent times, therapeutical 
fashions aave changed with greater rapidity 
and the role of anatomical arch villian has 
shifted from the appendix to the tonsils and 
from the tonsils to the teeth. Now it looks 
as if it might be enthusiastically passed on 
to the ductiess glands, but for the present it 
is ge securely in the possession of the 
eeth. 5 1 

It would be interesting to know how many 
million teeth have been sacrificed during the 
past few years and why, but unfortunately 
no complete statistics are available. Person- 
ally, nearly everyone of our acquaintance has 
contributed at least one strong, full-grown 
tooth te the cause of health but we have 
et to hear of any swift and miraculous cures. 

ree years ago, when the theory of focal in- 
fection was still comparatively new, we re- 
member that we were greatly impressed by 
the enthusiasm of a woman dentist who has 
just discovered that her sister had three or 
maybe four infected teeth. The girl had had 
a long series of tubercular glands, and here, 
of course, was the cause! The guilty teeth 
were quickly pulled, the family breathed a 
sigh of relief, and the girl gradually improy- 
ed in weight and strength. Here,“ thought 
everybody, is living proof of the new 
theory.“ Rut, not long ago, we learned that 
the young woman was again in a hospital suf- 
fering with another tubercular gland. 

Teeth and Nerves 

In another case, a suburban resident af- 
flicted with an over-abundance of leisure and 
a nervous malady had his teeth X-rayed, hop- 
ing to find that an infected tooth was the 
cause of his disability, The revelations of 
the X-ray were most satisfactory. They not 
Only showed that he had an infected tooth, 
but that it was a tooth with wayward tenden- 
cies that had grown Upward instead of dawn- 
ward in its extreme youth and was lodged 
behind his nose. He remembered, he told 
the dentist, that the tooth had never appear- 
ed when it was expected and that after a few 
years of patient waiting he had acquired a 
pivot tooth as a substitute. He immediately 
underwent an operation and the offending 
organ was removed, after which, he was as- 
sured, his extreme nervousness would dis- 
appear, But it didn't, and now he is -sus- 
picious of all medical theories. When it was 
suggested that he try psychoanalysis, he re- 
plied bitterly that he was through experi- 
menting with bunk.“ 

The majority of laymen, including probably 
even this disappointed hypochondriac, are 
able to see the danger of focal infection, of 
course, and,. are only too anxiqus to have it 
removed. But they are losing their faith in 
tooth-pulling as a panacea for all afflictions, 
from epilepsy to tonsilitis. 

Among ths various ailments attributed to

pro on that certain ö insani 
are undoubtedly caused by bacterial infec- 
tion in the intestines, jntroduced through de» 
fective teeth. Moreover, it is that 
“vietims of insanity in considerable numbers 
have been cured by proper attention to de- 
cayed or the removal of misplaced teeth,“ 
“If this seems preposterous to the 
man,“ says one medical authority, let him 
bear in mind that the hollow in a 
easily harbor two billion (2,000,000,000— 
the figures are more impressive) germs and 
that re may be 60 varieties of those in @ 
single decayed spot. All of them are await- 


the 


bleod circulation, by means of which the par- 
ticular kind of infection which they represent 
is carried to the tistzues most suitable for the 
propagation of the germ and the exploitation 
of the malady,” 1 

Colonel Roosevelt heads the list of im- 
pressive faltalities attributed to focal infec- 
tion. According to the bulletin issued at the 
time of his death, he had been suffering 
from an attack of rheumatism about two 
months. His progress had been entirely sat- 
isfactory and his condition had not given 
cause for any special concern The 
cause of death was an embolus.” 

An embolus, it seems, is a clot of blood 
which gets into the blood stream and floats 
along until it meets a blood vessel whose eali- 
ber is too small to permit its passage. In 
Colonel Roosevelt’s case, according to his 
physician, Dr. George W. Faller, the clot was 
probably arrested in the lungs, but it might 
have stopped the brain. But the signifi- 
cant feature is that both the colonel's rheu- 
matism and the resulting blood clot were at- 
tributed by his physicians to an infected 
tooth 20 years earlier. 

“Cancer” Only a Bad Tooth 

One of the most interesting cases in which 
a serious ailment was traced directly to an 
infected tooth is given in a recent book on 
the subject of the ‘‘teeth-theory” by Dr. Ryan 
a well-known practical dentist, and Dr. Bow- 
ers, a well-known physician-author. 

„A woman,” it says, was being treated by 
a physician for what he supposed was a can- 
cer at the lower margin of the breast. It was 
a suppurating sore and required constant at- 
tention. One day when the physician start- 
ed to dress it he exclaimed sharply: 

„ou have been going to some other doc- 
tor for treatment.’ 

“The patient denied it, but the doctor de- 
clared that he eould smell creosote coming 
out of the supposed cancer. 

„ went to my dentist yesterday,’ said 
the patient, ‘and he put some creosote in a 
tooth.’ 

G0 back to him at once and tell him to 
pull that tooth,’ said the physician. 

“As soon as the tooth was out the ‘cancer’ 


The pus from an ulcerated tooth in the pa- 
tient’s lower jaw had followed the line of 
least resistance and had burrowed a channel 
among the muscles of the neck and chest, 
finally emerging at the lower margin of the 
left breast.“ 

The authors of this book present an er- 
tremely rational and convincing ease for the 
„teeth theory.“ They do not advocate the 
ruthless extraction of teeth. They believe 
that all teeth be saved that can be saved, al- 
ways proviaed their retention does not inter- 
fere with the normal process of health. The 
teeth of children, they urge, should be given 
particular attention, because 
fection in early life may be traced ailments 
that often do not reveal their malignant char- 


plug the interior of blood vessels, causing 

paralysis and death.“

dinner dishes were cleared away,

„Woll, you mus. see him inside of

“Nix on that stuff,” said Andrew, waving 
his hand. “J am too fat to run around with

“You had just .s well hush for you are

“Now, you know how hot-tempered Ella

this misunderstandigg came at Christmas 
time. He had been sent for to go to Idaho 
or Arizona or some place to report on a mine 
that some men here were contemplating 
buying and he had to stay there longer than 
he expected and could not get home for 
Christmas, 

When he found it out, he was worried 
about Ella’s Christmas present. As he had 
no close women friends he did what I 
thought was a very sensible thing, consider- 
ing that he and Ella were to be married 
next June. He wrote her a nice, long letter 
and told her he wanted to get her some- 
thing, of course, and he was down tHere in 
that little mining camp where he could buy 
nothing, so he seat her a $50 bill and told 
her to go and buy something just to suit 
herself for her Christmas present. 

“Ella cried her eyes out when she told me 
about it, for she says she had always earn- 
ed her own living, and so had not been able 
to indulge herself in some of the little lux-

ing some absolutely foolish things she had 
always wanted, and she did. 

“Then Charlie came home sooner than he 
had expected and she went to the train to 
meet- him. They went to the Cafe Royal to 
dinner and fooled around with some people 
they met there until about 9 o'clock and 
went home to Ella’s boarding house. It was 
10 o’clock before the parlor was clear and 
he went up and took her in his arms and 
kissed her. She is one of those girls who 
would not kiss a man in a railroad station 
it he traveled across the continent to see 
her. 
„Well, as he said, he kissed her and said, 
„Now we are alone at last and I want you 
to show me what you bought with your 
Christmas money.’ 

„Before she thought she slapped his jawe 
and walked out of the room and left him 
standing there in amazenfent. It was not 
until she got up to.her room that she re- 
membered that he did not know what she 
had bought*Ther, of course, she could not 
explain and all she could do was sit there 
and cry as she heard him go out and slam 
the door.“ 

„Well,“ said Andrew, what had she 
bought? Why shouldn't he ask her?“ 

Why, she had bought some of those lit- 
tle lacy, foolish things a woman wears and, 
of course, she could not show them to him 
and she got mad when he asked to see 
them. You must go to him and tell him 
what I have told you and be sure and don’t 


or that I know you told him.” 

“But won’t she get mad?” asked Andrew. 

“Of course not, you ninny,”’ sald Imogene, 
impatiently. “She told me to tel] you that she 
told me and for you to tell him, but not to 
let him know that she knows you tell him. 
She does not want to decefye him about it, 
but just wants him to write to her that he! 


J do,” exclaimed Andrew, “and 1 will.”

THE INVISIBLE 


Ten million letters were carried by the 
air mail in the last three months, That's at 
the rate of 40,000,000 letters a year, 

The cost of carrying a ton of mail by fly- 
ing machine averaged eight dollars a mile 
in 1920. It was eut to six dollars a mile in 
1921. The cost soon will be down to two 
dollars and sixty cents a mile, due to improved 
airplanes now being put in use. 

The postoffice, which started the air mail 
service as an experiment in May, 1918, is the 
first to prove the commereial value of the 
flying machine. 

It requires no stretching of the imagina- 
tion to picture all mail being carried by the 
air route. That may come within five years. 

Here is a prediction: In a few years mai) 
will be earried by invisible postmen. 

Letters and parcels will, be loaded into 
airplanes controlled by wireless. 

The airpldnes, with nobody aboard, will 
rise into the air at, say, New York, fly like 
an arrow and land in San Francisco, operated 
and steered by wireless. : 

Important experiments along this line have 
just been successfully completed in France. 
Wireless-controlied airplanes, without crews, 
were kept in the air for an hour and navi- 
gated about as easily as if a pilot were aboard. 

The wireless-controlled airplane shows how 
man is conquering the invisible. It is mil- 
lions of times more wonderful than the Hindu 
fakir’s trick of moving small objects without 
touching them— as th> fakir puts it, power of 
mind over matter. 

The wireless is man's most uncanny inven- 
tion. It may also develop into his most im- 
portant, 

Many now living may see the day when the 
sky will be dotte1 with swarms of crewless 
airplanes, controlled by wireless and getting 
their motive power by wireless, carrying mail, 
express, passengers and even freight.——N.

MY FAVORITE STORY 


By Irvin Cobb 
THE PRIDE OF A CREATIVE GENIUS. 


A colored ‘person of a formidable aspect 
was arraigned in a South Carolina court of 
justice on a charge of mayhem. As Exhibit A, 
for the case of the prosecution, the mutilated 
victim of his wrath was presented before the 
juror’s sympathetic eyes, The face of the vic- 
tim was little more than a recent site—a place 
where a face had been, but was no longer 

When the jury very promptly and very 
properly had returned a verdict of guilty, his 
honor, the presiding judge, pointing to the 
chief complaining witness and addressing the 
defendant said: 

“This is the most lamentable example of 
brutality 1 have ever seen in a long experience 
on the criminal bench. Surely no human be- 
ing, unless he were inspired by infernal influ- 
ences and hell-born suggestions, could deliber- 
ately work such wreckage as you have worked 
upon the countenance of a defenseless and 
helpless fellow creature. Demons from below 
surely must have prompted you in what you 
did, It must have been the devil himself who 

ed you on and on and on.” 

Well, Jedge,” said the prisoner, “come to 
think it over, I ain't shore but what you're right. 
As I look back on it now it do seem lak 
to me at wen I wuz cuttin’ his nose loose 
from his face wid @ razor, the, devil was right

from his nose.’ An’ | ‘spects it must a been

RED MITTENS 


The world would be a pleasanter place to 


live in if people would wear red mittens. 


Red. mittens add a touch of color that is 
totally lacking in most winter scenes, and 
ter scenes, except upon occasions, are the 
colorless scenes cf the year. 

A man wearing red mittens is making con- 
tribution to the general good. Red mittens 
look warm. They warm the eye a well as 


ene fingers and the hands. 


In the cities, especially, men should wear 
red mittens. Seeing them, people think 
of their childhood hemes, of the 


old-fashioned hearts and hearth fires. The 
grinding city nes is red mittens-—The Vine-

he feels she as no rights aside 
from his wishes he kidnaps her 
and carries her off on his yacht,

refuses to work, and then a 
storm brings her into more per-

Blakeslee, so that he sees her 
for the first time as a woman, in- 
stead of an office machine. Theo 
feela that a business relation-

decides to give into him, but a 
broken propellor carries the 
yacht out of its course and 
changes the plan of the trip. 


CHAPTER XXIV 
L sleep, inasmuch as there was 


The Stolen Clothes 

ATE in the afternoon Theo de- 
nothing else to do, and slipping out 
of her suit she curled up in the 
chaise longue. When she awoke 
dusk had fallen, but the yacht was 
atill drifting. | E 

She rose and snapped on the elec- 
tric lights, but when she turned back 
to the chair on which she had left 
her suit there was nothing there. 

She started back in amazement. 
She remembered so well hanging her 
coat on the back of the chair with 
her skirt folded up under it. But 
they were no longer there, that much 
was certain. 

Suddenly suspicious, she flew to 
the door. It was unlocked. She! 
had forgotten to lock it after thet 
steward had carried out her tray. 
Some one, no doubt, Mrs. Breen, had 
come into the cabin while she had 


clothes. 

Making an effort to be calm, Theo 
rang the bell that summoned a stew- 
ard and waited for him to knock 
at her door. But when the knock 
finally came and she called, “Come 
in,” it was Mrs. Breen who opened 
the door and stepped into the room. 

“Yes, Miss Caldwell,” she said 
urbanely, that same little twinkle 
that Theo had grown to distrust in 
her light blue eyes. 

“Do you know anything about my 
clothes?” Theo asked abruptly. 
“They were on that chair when I 
went to sleep.“ . 

„es, Mrs. Breen returned calm- 
ly. “I took them.” 

Theo stared. “You took them!” she 
repeated after a moment. 
you mind telling me why?” 
spite of her efforts to be calm, and 
not to lose her temper, her 4 
trembled, Mrs. Breen's attitude was 
so very exasperating. 

“Why, no, I don’t mind telling you, 
Mr. eslee asked me to doit. He 
told me to tell you there are plenty 
of things for you to wear, and he 
is sure you can find something more 
appropriate.” 

She raised her blue eyes to Theo's 
level green ones, but before the girl’s 
look, Mrs. ’s fell. 

Would you mind getting my suit 
for me immediately?’’ Theo asked, 
her voice pitched very low. 

Mrs. Breen shook her head. 

“I’m sorry, but that’s impossible.“ 

“You mean, you won't get it?” 

“3 can’t. I must do as Mr. Biakes- 
lee orders.” 

She looked at Theo expectantly, 
evidently under the impression that 
the girl would show signs of temper, 
but Theo had no intention of giving 
Mrs. Breen that satisfaction. 

“Very well,“ she said turning 
away with a show of indifference, 
although she had an almost uncon- 
trollable impulse to rush up to Mrs. 
Breen and shake her until she beg- 
ged for mercy. 

The older woman lingered. 

“See here, Miss Caldwell, why 
can't you be sensible?“ she began. 
“Mr. Blakeslee intends to be kind, 
he 537 


t Theo interrupted fiercely. 
“You needn't go on, Mrs. Breen, 
after all, it's not your affair.” 
Mrs. Breen shrugged her shoulders 
and marched out of the room, leav- 
ing Theo with the realization that

Old Man Coyote’s Secret Ig Out 
An secrets, "tis the law of fate, 
Will be discovered soon or lat. 

| —Old Man Coyotes 


ARMER BROWN’S BOY gave 
F a long whistle of surprise as 
the atack of 


he stare at an opening under 

w in the barnyard. 

The hanging w partly hid it, but 
plainly it was the entrance to a 
he fi a small opening he wouldn’t 


have been surprised, for he knew 
that a strawstack is often made use 


But this. opening 
was big enough for a Dog. 
Farmer Brown's Boy knelt down 
and peeped in, but it was too dark 
under that stack for him to see any- 
thing. Right away he thought of 
Reddy Fox. “I wonder,” said he, “if 
that sly scamp has been making his 
home here right in our v barn- 
yard. And I wonder if he is here 
now. Bowser will soon find out. 


He stood up and whistled for 
Bowser the Hound, who was up by 
the house. Bowser came at once, 
wagging his tail as he trotted along. 
“Here, Bowser, see if anybody 
is in there,” commanded Farmer 
Brown's Boy as he pointed down to 


ently Bowser put his nose down and 
sniffed. He took only one good sniff 
and then backed away in a hurry, 


The hair along his back and neck 
stood up and he started to run back 
to the house. It was only when his 
master spoke to him sharply that he 
stopped. Shecpishly he came back 
part way, but nothing that Farmer 
Brown's Boy could do would make 
him come close up to that opening 
again. 

Farmer Brown’s Boy didn’t know 
what to make of it. “Black Pussy 
Bowser is 
scared,” said he, talking to himself. 
“Bowser wouldn't be afraid of a Fax. 
Perhaps Jimmy Skunk is under 
there.“ Both Black Pussy and Bow- 
ser have learned to respect Jimmy 
Skunk. That, must be who it is, 
though Jimmy never in the world 
made this big hole under the straw. 
Anyway, we'll soon find out.“ 


He started for the barn to get a 
pitchfork to tear open that stack. 
Just as he reached the barn he look- 
ed back. He was just in time to 
catch a glimpse of a gray form be- 
fore it disappeared back of the barn. 
He ran around behind the barn. 
Running across the snow covered 
Green Meadows as only he can run, 
He was head- 
ing for the Old Pasture. Too sur- 
to do anything but stare after 
m, Farmer Brown's Boy watched 
him out of sight. ' 
„Well, I never!” he exclaimed as 
Old Man Coyote disappeared in the 
Old Pasture. The clever old rascal! 
I wonder how long he has been liv- 
ing under that stack? He knew we 
would never in the world suspect 
him of living as close to us as that. 
I'll get that fork now and have a 
look at his den.“ 
So Farmer Brown’s Boy got the 
pitchfork and opened that stack of 
straw. He uncovered the snug den 
Old Man Coyote had made there, 
and he knew by the signs that it had 
been used for some time. Partly 
pushed under the straw at one side 
was a piece Of brown paper. Farm- 
er Brown’s Boy pulled it out. Slowly 
a grin crept across his freckled face 
until the freckles ran together. 
“The mystery of the lost meat is 
a mystery no longer,” said he. “Old 
Man Coyote must have sneaked out 
from under here and grabbed that 
meat out of the basket while Dad 
and I were in the barn that day. I 
remember setting the basket down 
just a few feet from this stack. He 
had plenty of time to slip out, grab 
that meat and get back under here. 
The old sinner! No wonder we 
couldn’t guess what had become of 
that meat. But I don’t know as I 
am sorry he got it; guess he needed 
it more than we did.“ 
That was just like Farmer Brown’s 
Boy. i

she could not even steal out for a 
walk on deck unless she wore some 
of the clothes that Richard Blakeslee 
had provided for her. 

Once alone she shook with help- 
less rage, she had not known herself 
capable of such fury. She wanted

„ HERE does not seem to be as 


much uncertainty about th 
outcome of the game tonight 


between the A. A. C. and the Au- 
burn university quintet as there 
usually is about the weekly basket- 
ball game, but tonight’s exhibition 
ought to please the fans who like 
to see*the club .team have every- 
thing its own way. 

The Auburn team opened the sea- 
son last night. when they played 
Mercer at Macon. They lost this 
game by a Score of 31 to 7, but as 
this was the first, me of the sea- 
son, they may Still be counted 
as an uncertain quantity. The Au- 
burnites always put up a good scrap, 
and can be counted on to put their 
strongest lineup in the field tonight.

KING OF BALL PLAYERS’ 
Ty Cobb vs. “Babe” -Ruth 

Past masters of the festive art 

Of starting up a rally, 

Or caving in a pitcher’s heart 

While carving out a. tally, 

With all the records jotted down, 

Which of you two deserves the 

crown?

They hammer home runs from the 
lot 
Nor scorn the lowly single. 
If I were questi d under oath 
d say—‘‘There’s fame enough for 
both.“ 
Rival High Spots 
Ruth —One hundred and thirteen 
home runs in two seasons. 
Cobb—Batting average of .371 for 
seventeen years. 


Ruth—Three hundred and thirty- 
six runs last two years—breaking 
Cobb's old record. twice. 

Cobb— Led leagne at batting 
twelve out of thirteen years—1907- 
1919. 


Ruth—Broke home run 
three years in succession. 
Cobb—Averaged fifty steals a year 
for last Sixteen years. 
A Few Comparisons

spectacular ball player thut ever 


record 


| Welsh, I. f. (18) R. At_rcrombie, I. f. lived. 


Cobb is the most durable cham- 
pion of all time. 

Ruth is the greater drawing card. 
His feat of smaShing the home run 
record. by wide margins for three 
years: is @he#of the most -astonish- 
ing of l baseball feats. 

Byt Cobb's record of leading his 
league_ e out of thirteen con- 
secutive years is equally astonishing. 

The great Wagner led his league 
but eight times in twenty years. 

The brilliant Lajoie led his league 
but four times in twenty years. 

Cobb, from 1907 to 2920, led the 
league twelve times. And in 1921, 
his seventeenth eaipaign, ke finish- 
ed with .390, only a hit or two from 


the top. ah 
Durable Champion 

Cobb’s greatest year has been put 
down as 1911, when he made 248 
hits, scored 148 runs, etole 83 base 
and batted 4200. 

But we should say his Freatest 
test year was 1921—Jast season. 

He was then harassed by, the 
cares of management through a 
season af trouble and worry.

But in spite of this he batted .390. 
In his seventeenth season he batted 
nineteen points higher than his 
grand average for seventeen years. 

This is one of the most remark- 
able contributions in the extended 
history of the sport. 


So the wonder of Cobb becomes a 
matter of both quality and quan- 
tity, combinations that rarely exist.

greatness upon three achievements. 

The first is a home run record in 
1919, 1920 ands 1921—more than 
doubling the old major league mark. 

The second is.that in 1920 and 
1921 he broke the run-making rec- 
ord by decisive spans, lifting Cobb’s 
old record of 148 to 178.“ 

Thirty runs added to Cobb’s best 
is no flippant maneuver. . 

The third is that Ruth is also one 
of the all-around stars of the game 
where he has displayed exceptional 
wares in the outfield, in the box 
and around first base. 

As a pitcher he was one of the 
greatest left-handers of his day. 
This ability to star upon both at- 
tack and defense has given him 
double value. 

Ty vs. the “Babe” 

It might be claimed that a great, 
hard hitting infielder, such as Hans 
Wagner, is more valuable to a ball 
club than either—and that Wagner 
should be rated first. . 

Perhaps for team value this may 
be true. 


the printed records of fact than by 
any opinion. 

The records set by Ty and the 
“Babe” are far beyond all other 
figures. . a 

Cobb, by leading his league twelve 
out of thirteen years; Ruth, by 
smashing all home run records and 
all run making records by such 
wide margins, must be listed as the 
nonpareils of baseball. Ye 


Ruth is the more spectacular of 
a 
department that always brings the 
big thrill and calls upon the loud 
est chéer. 


Yet Cobb’s ability to lead a league 
twelve years against such opposi- 
tion as Tris Speaker, Larry Lajoie. 
Joe Jackson, Eddie Collins, George 
Sisler and others may never be 
equaled—any more than Ruth's rec- 
ord of 113 home runs in two seasons. 
Perhaps it might be just as well to 
dally a bit longer until both have 
completed their careers before any 
final checking up is done, with the 
ultimate verdict turned in to Time’s 
| dust-covered scroll.

“When the prep school stars real-

Blake, Esq., is in a fous con-

and his handsome

LIONEL WEST, whom I used to 
know as Billy West, from which 
monicker Lionel switched for the 
excellent reason of the Chaplin feet 
affected by another Billy West— 
Lionel West, I repeat, gave a party 
Friday evening in the apartment of 

B. Hazel, at 21 West Alexander 
street, borrowed for the occasion be- 
cause Lionel, star in “Dangerous 
Love” at the Criterion next week, 
was going to do the cooking himself. 


‘MR. WEST prefaced his invitation 
with the comment that he at least 
was certain he he a better cook than 
actor. 
ed helpings of lobster at la New- 
burg, flanked by sweet potatoes top- 
ped with marshmallows and follow- 
ed by salad, I am prepared solemnly 
to state (on the morning after) that 
Mr. West might be a far worse actor 
than he is a cook and still be a 
heluva good actor. 


A GREAT IDEA would be for 
Mr. West to accompany his per- 
sonal appearance at the Criterion, 
along with Dangerous Love,” with 
a battery of chafing dishes of leb- 
ster. Not having seen “Dangerous 
Love” yet, I can’t be sure of course. 
if the patrons would, like the love, 
but I’ll gamble they would love 
the lobster. 


LIONEL looks just the same as 
he did as Billy West—a great big 
chap with a magnificent neck and 
shoulders; a 205-pounder with a

Egypt” and “the perfection of bru- 
tality’ (says Grace Kingsly) in 
“Things Men Do” a brand new pic- 
ture. Actor, athlete, gentleman,” 
is what Hobar Bosworth says of 
him—and the Hon. Hobart is quali- 
fied to speak with authority.“ 


ANYWAY, we had a delectable 
party, and some of the most re- 
markable stories were told, unter 
the influence of the lobster, pos- 
sibly, that I ever heard. Morris 
Mitchell, John E. Holland, Van Wilk- 
inson, H. Grady Brim, Dr. George 
E. Woollard and Cliff ‘Wheatley 
were the other guests, Mr. West 
and Mr Hazel being hosts. Billy 
says he recokns he learned to cook 
watching, the skilled and aged Sene- 
gambian chef on the old Georgia 
plantation; but I'll bet he picked up 
that lobster trick somewhere else. 


SEVERAL hundred thousand zgolf- 
ers scattered over this broad land 
are hoping today that the annual 
meeting of the United States Golf 
association, in Chicago, will  offi- 
cially cut down the out-of-bounds 
penalty to one stroke—that is, loss 
of distance only. The interest in 
this rule, and the objection to the 
stroke-and-distance, penalty ‘trans- 
cends by far the consideration of 
the stymie rule, though it is hoped 
that also will be settled one way or 
another. 


AS II IS, the out-of-bounds rule 
can be modified to loss of distance 
only by individual clubs, but this 
gives rise, as pointed out recently 
in Atlanta, by Bob Martin, of the 
Capital City club, to differences in 
club handicaps between clubs using 
the two-stroke ‘penalty, and those 
using the one-stroke ‘penalty. 


TOM PAINE, of Atlanta, who is 
to be elected a member of the U. S. 
G. A. executive committee at the 
meeting tonight, did not go to the 
meeting, but it is understood that in 
replying to a number of letters 
from the heads of both the U. 8. 
G. A. and the Western Golf asso- 
ciation—of which he was for many 
years an executive officer—he advo- 
cated strongly the tendency toward 
liberalism in regard to the stymie, 
the out-of-bounds, the lost ball and 
the cleaning of the ball regulations. 
Mr. Paine practically got the next 
national women’s championship for 
White Sulphur—an ideal course and 
location; and he is still working to 
get the national open championship 
for East Lake in 1923, with good 
prospects of success.

| With the pitching strength, which 
is boasted by the Yankees there is 
not a team in the American league 
now that will give up a pitcher, even 
one who is threatened with having 
tin tied to him. Jim Dunn, of 
Cleveland, wails that he is willing 


But we are going here more by to pay any kind of a price for a 


pitcher if there is one in the base- 
ball business who can be bought. Of 
course he wants a pitcher who can 
win a little something. The Amer- 
/ican league knows his fix so Dunn 
says and hasn't shown the slight- 
est inclination to help him. : 

Too bad for poor Cleveland. The

guage that would have scaled the 
paint from a freight car on a cold 


day. 
Cobb Needs Inflelder 
If Cobb can get a good infielder 
for Veach he is making a trade 
worth whfle because the Detroit 
club must get an infield better than 


back in the race. 

Cobb probably realizes by this 
time how Hugh Jennings used to

Cleveland has been depressed ever 
since the two colonels put through, 
the deal that gave New York Scott,

to that time Cleveland figured that 
it was in the parade for 1922. When 
Ruth and Meusel were thrown out 
of court by the Landis decision the 
Cleveland folks leaned back in their 
chairs and just laughed themselves 
happy. It looked as if Cleveland 
had better than an even chance to 
win the pennant in 1922. St. Louis 
felt good about the decision also.

was again the bright star of the 
game, though her teammates gave 
her wonderful assistance. However, 
it was due to Miss Phillips’ uncan- 
ny ability in locating the basket 
that paved the way for Draughon’s 
victory. She scored eleven of her 
team’s 21 points, and her passing 
contributed greatly to the cther 
goals that her side made. 
The whole Draughon quintet play- 
ed excellent ball and guarded the 
visitors so closely that they had lit- 
tle chance to shoot. Miss Wilson 
especially was a thorn in the side of 
the Auburn team, and it due to 
her superb work that the score was 
no closer. For Auburn, Floyd, at 
left forward, was the outstanding 
player, shooting six of her team’s 
eight points.

Sam Wylie, well-known colored 
bird and rabbit hunter, gave his an-

enough, possum and ‘'taters for 
twenty more. Sam never charges 
his white friends anything for in-

if each of them leaves $1 under his 
plate he doesn't object. And they’ 
usually do.

‘UNEXPECTED 


* 


ANNIVE RSARY 


(Copyright, 1922, by W. Werner.) 


YDDY ALVERSON kneaded 


bread with hard thumps; she 

‘ pounded the dough as if she 
had a grudge against it. Her thin 
old face was stern with re 
feeling. If it had not been for the 
bread Lyddy might have opened her 
tightly closed lips and spoken some 
of the things that rankled in her 
mind. 

Jake, Lyddy’s husband, brought ‘n 
an ‘armful of wood from the wood- 
shed, dropped it behind the stove, 
and cougned loudfy. Usually such 
a cough would have brought anxious 
comment Lyddy, but new she 

paid no heed. Helpless, Jake went 
over and sat down by the window 
and turned his head persistently to 
gaze out at the falling snow. But 
for the snow he would have taken 
his ax and gone up to the wood lot | 
and chopped wood. Anything was 
better than this persistent silence 
he was living in. Lyddy had not 
spoken to him in two days since 
their difference“ Tuesday morning. 
He passed his hairy old hand over 
his bald head and sighed,. feeling 
himself a badly treated husband. 


Lyddy cut her dough, molded it 
and put it in the tins to rise for the 
last time, apparently as unconscious 
of her husband as if he had not been 
in the room. But inwardly she knew 
by the way Jake clasped and un- 
clasped his hands that he was miser- 
able. She was miserable, too, but she 
wouldn't give in. Se. wondered how 
long she and Jake could go on living 
together without speaking. She won- 
dered what ailed them anyway that 
they couldn’t get along better after 
so many years of married life, dur- 
ing which they had been as peaceable 


and well-behaved as most couples. 


To think of her flying mad just be- 
cause Jake hid upset the chicken 
feed on her clean stove, putting out 
the fire and mussing up things gen- 
erally! Of course, he didn't mean 
to do it; his hands were not as 
strong as they had been. But it 
had made an awful mess, which she 
hadn’t felt like caning up just 
then. To think, too, that when she 
snapped up Jake he should have re- 
sponded in kind: He never had done 
that before. She had always held 
that it was a disgraceful thing for 
two old people to quarrel, but they 
had quarreled as hotly and vocifer- 
ously as if they were eighteen and 
twenty, instead of sixty-eight and 
seventy. 


“If Jake stays in the kitchen all 
this morning I shall have to go up 
in the attic and find something to 
do, cold as it is.“ Lyddy thbught as 
she covered the white loaves with a 
clean towel. She picked up a knife 
and began to scrape the breadboard, 
although scarcely a flake of dough 
adhered to it. The neatest of home-. 
makers was Lyddy. 


this?“ 


Behind her Jake spoke suddenly 
in tones of joy and surprise. Hello! 
Here's Bessy!” 


woman was entering almost before 
Lyddy could turn round. 

“Hello, good folks!“ cried Bessy. 
She was a big wholesome woman, 
with red cheeks. She had a big bas- 
ket. ‘‘How are you, Aunt Lyd? How 
are you, Uncle Jake?“ 


them both, with hearty smacks. 


“Shall I put you out if I stay to 
once düring the meal, 


dinner? Harry's gone over to the 


| village, and he'll probably be back, 
I brought along a few things 


too. 
in case you should not be expecting 
so much company.“ 

Now. you need’nt a' done tlat,“ 
said Lyddy, reproachfully. 


got hash to warm up.” 
Bessy took off her hat and coat 
and furs, and, while Lyddy carried 


them into the bedroom, warmed her | 


hands at the stove. When Lyddy | 


came back Bessy opened the basket | 


and took out a pair of roast ducks 
and a big white frosted cake. Uncle 
Jake, whit do you think of that?“ 
she demanded. They're a pair of 
my Perkins. I knew you liked duck. 
I brought them for vou.“ 


Land's sakes, you didn't expect 


| Smiled. 
He had the door open and the everybody looking on. 


She kissed 
does seem good to have you folks 


me to eat ’em both, did you?” cried | 


Uncle Jake, warming up. 

Bessy laughed. “You'll have to 
do your share. This cake is a golden 
sponge and I made it expressly for 
you, Aunt Lyddy. There now!” 

It's a beauty,” said Lyddy, “but 
when I have company, Bessy, I like 
to furnisn the victuals. Jake, who's 
that pounding at the door?“ 

She had said it in spite of her- 
self, and she turned so red that her 

cheeks almost matched Béssy’s. But 

Jake did not hear. He, too.“ had 
heard the noise and hurried to the 
door, where Was more company, 
heavily laden. This was Hiram 
Ward, Jake’s nephew, and his ife, 
from over Chilton way. 

“Land's sakes, what ever started 
you folks out on such a day as 
exclaimed Hake, beaming. 
“Come in, come in. Where's “your 
team? Left it at the stables im the 
village, eh? . Well, this seems real 
kind-a pleasant to have you here

Lyddy was doing her best to wel- 
come her guests. “I don’t know 


when you've been here, Alice.“ she 


said as she helped Hiram’s wife un- 
wrap her many mufflings of fur and 
shawl and scarf. It's a cold day. 
You neei all on you can get on,“ 
she remarked as Alice laughingly 
apologized for her many outer gar- 
ments. 

As soon as she had made her 
guests comfortable Lyddy hurried 
downstairs and brought up a big 
pan of potatoes and sat down to 
pare them. Bessy put the ducks to 
warm, and Alice unpacked the things 
she had brought—a beautiful little 


baked ham, fruit, nuts, candy, and. 


a delicious-looking salad. 

“Well, I guess you folks thought 
we wouldn’t have anything for you 
to eat,“ said Lyddy. 

“IT always like to take a little 
something along when I go visiting 
unexpected.“ Alice replied. ‘‘Uncle 
Jake, for goodness sake, who's that 
at the door? I believe it’s Lon Piper 
and Frank.!“ 

It was, ar. these- old friends of 
Jake and Lyddy entered gayly. 
Frankle Piper, tiny, merry. had 
brought two mince pies, a bottle of 
cream for coffee, a jar of mixed 
pickles and a glass of apple jelly. 

“Forever more! What shall we 
ever do with all these victuals?” ex- 
claimed Lyddy. 

Harry, Bessy’s j husband, came 
bearing a small freezer of ice cream. 
Then the men sat down to talk, 
while the women put extra leaves in 
the diningroom table, hunted up Lyd- 
dy’s best tablecloth and got out her 
best china and silver. For the first 
time in her life Lyddy came near 
burning her bread. But at last din- 
ner was set forth! And such an ar- 
ray as there was! 

“I declare, it’s a feast! said Jake, 
rubbing his hands and looking round 
delightedly.

Break-Up of Cannes. 
Conference Leaves 


War Debt Up in Air 


By GEORGE WITTE, 
(Special Wireless to The Atlanta Journal and 
Chicago Daily News—opyright, 1922.) 

BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 14.— 
The breaking up of the Cannes con- 


ference has left the reparations 
question up in the eir and caused 
alarm in German government cir- 
cles because Germany is unable to 
pay $119,000,000 due tomorrow. Al- 
though, it is not expected here that 
the allies will go the limit and put 
more sanctions into effect as the 
result of the failure to pay, it is 
generally felt that Germany is at 
their mercy. 

There is some conjecture as to 
whether the supreme council will 
send Germany an ultimatum, stipu- 
lating the amount and the terms ot 
payment thus depriving Germany 
of the chance she had at Cannes to 
plead for more lenient conditions. 
The Wirth cabinet, though it is 
meeting daily, has adopted a policy 
of watchful waiting until it becomes 
known Sunday evening or Monday 
what the allies have decided to do. 

It is the general jmpression here 
that the Briand incident must have 
created a bad impression in the 
United States, as it is believed that 
the final resolution to be adopted 
by the limitation of armament con- 
ference may be considerably delayed 
by the new situation in France.

Financial Review 


NEW YORK, Jan. 14.-—Motors led the 
market at the opening of the New Tork 
Stock Exchange today. The first sale of 
Chandler was at 54%, up 1%. 
2,200 shares was taken at this price. Stude- 
baker gained ™ at 84. While this is a new 
high on the move for Chandler, Studebaker 
sold at 84% two weeks ago. Sugars were 
also higher, with American Sugaf making 
an early high at 59%, up . 

Corn Products epened at 10014, compared 
with the high Friday of 100%. This stock 
is now within about five points of its rec. 
‘ord high. 

Steel common gained 16. at ,, and 
Hult States, ™%, at 49. Mexican Petroleum 
featured the oils, with a gain of 76. at 11076. 
Rails were fractionally higher. 

The market was strong throughout the 
first hour. Among leaders were Mexican 
Petroleum, Asphalt, Guif States Steel and 
Famous Players. Famous Players preferred, 
which sold at 97 late in December and then 
reacted about 5 ponits, made a new high 
at 98. 

It is significant that Gulf States Steel 
has most of its moves coincident with any 
publicity given Henry Ford's plan to buy 
Muscle Shoals. 

The strength which made itself felt dur- 
ing ¥riday’s session continued throughout 
today’s trading on the stock exchange. 
Stocks in which a new short interest had 
been built up during the decline of the 
‘ast two weeks, were the leaders. hese 
included many of the oils, equipmen T. and 
some of the independent steels. In the 
railroad group, Atchison, which hag been 
the carrier leader for some time, made a 
new high on the move. The impressive 
action Of this stock despite the fact that 
it only pays 6 per cent dividend yearly, 
has caused much comment and guess work. 
Some important Wall street banking inter- 
ests expect the dividend to be increased to 
7 per cent. 

There was some profit taking in the last 
half hour. Steel common retained a position 
above 84, which is within 2 points of 7921 
high. Independent steels in most cases 
were quiet. Atchison got above 97, a new 
high on the move. 

The market closed strong.

noted the previous night. Witness 
stated that her husband had four 
wounds. He was apparently im- 
proving until about in August, when 
it was decided to send him to At- 
lanta for examination and surgical 
attention. Mr. Ree in an Aa- 
1 hospital after operation, Aug- 


Dr. D. B. Ware, surgeon and phy- 
gician for the A., B. & A., and a 
practicing physician in Fitzgerald, 
testified to having found four 
wounds on the engineer and to hav- 
ing successfully treated three. Had 
him in local hospital from July 5 to 
August 28, when his condition be- 
came critical on account of. infec- 
tion of the wound in his leg. He 
gent him to chief surgeon of A., B. 
& A. at Atlanta, Dr. H. S. Gold- 
smith, for examination and treat- 
ment. 4 

Dr. J. R. Barfield, Atlanta, house 
physician of the hospital, testified 
to having made examination of Mr. 

on arrival in hospital and that 
his condition was bad. Mr. Reed ar- 
rived in Atlanta August 28, was op- 
erated on August 30, and died Aug- 
ust 31, as a result of infection of 
wounds received from gunshot. 
“Joe Batten, fireman of the III. 
fated engine, testified that he recog- 
nized Fairfield, who is also charged 
with the murder of Mr. and 
ho confessed to the crime, with 

Fred Stubbs on the night of the 

shooting within fifteen feet of the 

engine, both having guns in their 
hands. He did not see them shoot.

armed with pistols who returned fire 

of the attacking parties. He did not 
know Mr. Reed was shot until, he ar- 

rived at the depot. Mr. Reed had a 

pistol in his pocket. . Witness stated 

that the reason why he did not tell 
about recognizing Fairfield at a pre- 
vious trial, was because W. M. Mor- 
ris, master car builder of the At- 
lanta, Birmingham and Atlantic, had 
told him not to state whom he saw 
at the scene. 
A. W. Kirkland, master mechanic 
of the A., B. & A., testified that aft-

Body Merges With 
— * * 

Automobile Association 
The Atlanta Automotive Equip- 
ment association is now a part of 
the Atlanta Automobile Dealers’ as- 
sociation, the merger of the two or- 
ganizations taking place Friday eve- 
ning at a meeting at the Daffodil 
tea room. Although, by the merger, 
the members of the equipment asso- 
ciation gained a full-fledged member- 
ship in the Automobile Dealers’ as- 
sociation, carrying with it the right 
of affiliation with the Retail Mer : 
chants’ association, the organization 
will ‘retain its individuality insofar 
as matters pertaining to automobile 
accessories are coriterned. 
In ‘the merger association Lon 
Credelle; president of the equipment 
body, and Dowse Donaldson, Will 
represent the equipment and tire 
line# as officers. Mr. Credelle was 
elected third vice president of the 
organization, and Mr. Donaldson a 
director. 
The first regular meeting of the 
Automobile Dealers’ association, 
which members of the equipment 
association are eligible to attend. 
will be held Wednesday evening at 
the Kimball House. Dinner will be 
served at 6:15 o' clock, to be followed 
by the business program at 7. 
The meeting will be featured by 
the éxhibition. of a film produced by 
the Automotive Equipment Jobbers’ 
Association of America, for the pur- 
pose of improving the service and 
merchandising methods of retail 
establishments.’ Following this, a 
drawing by subscribers for spaces 
at the autémobile show in February 
will take place. The exhibition film 
is said to be a most impressive pro- 
duction, and every person connected 
with the automobile business in the 
city is invited to attend the meet- 
ing and witness it. 


600 More Soldiers 
En Route to Benning 
From Rhme Armies 


COLUMBUS, Ga., Jan. 14.—Two 
trainloads of troops are en route to 
Columbus and Benning, this being 
a development following the visit of 
Secretary Wainwright and General 
Harbord, deputy chief of staff, this 
week. 

The special trains left Ft. Slocum, 
N. Y., Friday, according to informa- 
tion reaching Columbus, and they 
are scheduled to reach the city Sun- 
day, one coming over the Central 
of Georgia via Atlanta, and the oth- 
er over the Southern. They win 
bring 300 each; local authorities say. 
This 600 or more men, including 
a number officers, make up a party 
receztly returning from Germany. 
They will be detailed at Camp Ben- 
ning, some becoming members of 
the Twenty-ninth infantry and oth- 
ers in different branches of the Berv- 
ice here. Plans for the additional 
forces are now being made at the 
infantry school. 

Whether or not this is a part of 
the movement looking to decided en- 
largements at Benning is not known, 
but it is believed to the first step 
Local military au- 
thorities are inclined to be reticent 
on the subject, but it is believed that 
further developments are coming in 
the immediate future. 

The troop trains, bringing the sol- 
diers from the Rhine, are expected 
some time Sunday. Local camp of- 
ficials look for the men Monday. Ar- 
rangements are being made for over 
600 men. 


Salaries of Faculty 
Members Have Risen 
50 Per Cent Since 1913 


CHICAGO, Jan. 14.—The salaries 
of presidents and faculty members 
in state colleges and universities 
have increased 50 per cent since the 
school year of 1913-14, John J. Ti- 
gert, commissioner of the bureau of 
education, nt of the inte- 
rior, asserted today in an address be- 
fore, the eighth annual meeting of 
the Association of American Col- 
leges. * 
In the collegiate year 1913-14; 
just previous to the break of the 
war,” he stated, “the average. sal: 

ot the presidents of the state 

stitutions was $5,249. In 1921-22, 
the present year, we asked the presi- 
dents to estimate the value of the 
rent of the houses given in addi- 
tion to the salary, and to add it to 
the salary. In this way we arrived 
at an average salary of $8,861 from 
ij seventy-four reporting. This would 
be an increase of about 69 per cent 
over the average for 1913-14, but no 
estimate of houses was made in that 
year. In 1920-21, when no houses 
were considered, the average presi-

Atlanta. Ga., January 14, 1922. 

Dry, clear weather has begun to dry out 
the roads in central-northern Georgia con- 
siderably, but as the surfaces have been 
frozen for several mornings they are rough 
and bumpy. , During the warmer part of 
the day they again thaw out and become 
very muddy. Al h not positively im- 
passable, except of the Tallulah 
Falls route, country roads are generally

more rapid improvement in roads.
