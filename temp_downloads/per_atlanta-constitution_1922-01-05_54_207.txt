EARLIER STATEMENT 


Savannah Man Appears 
to Refute Senator’s 
“Charges” — Flare Cre- 


ated by His Testimony. ering. 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 4.—Accuser 
and accused, in dramatic fashion, 
faced each other today before a sen- 
ate committee investigating charges 
that American soldiers had been | 
hanged without trial in France. | 

Near the close of a seven-hour ses- 
sion Major Hierome L. Opie, of Staun- 
ton, Va., commander of the third bat- 
talion, 116th infantry overseas, went 
on the stand to enter emphatic de- 
nial of charges by former service men 
that he had shot down some of his 
own soldier® in cold blood on the 
battlefield. He was asked, however, 
to step aside until other witnesses 
then in the room could testify against 
him, meanwhile being given the right 
through counsel to cross-examine 
them. 

Responding to his name when the 
Opie charges were taken up, Gray- 
son H. Withrow, of Baltimore, still 
in his early twenties, stepped to 
the front and testified that he saw 
the officer seize a gun from a pri- 
vate and fire at a man in his com- 
mand, Shells were falling overhead, 
he said, and there was tremendous 
excitement, but Withrow swore that 
from his retreat in a shell hole he 
peeped out and saw the man fall as 
the major’s gun'‘barked. But he could 
not say whether Opie had killed him, 
declaring the latter, standing out in 
the open, was within arm’s reach of 
half a dozen officers when the shot 
was fired. — 

Refuses to Give Names. 

As Withrow left the stand William 
F. St. John, a young man. from 
Lynchburg, Va., suffering from ner- 
vous troubles resulting from service 
overseas, accused the Virginian of 
shooting down a. “runner” at the 
front because he failed to heed aft- 
er thrice being ordered to halt, Four 
other men saw the killing, he de- 
clared, but he refused of his own 
accord to give their names, on the 
yround that he. had not been able 
to confer with them and that it woula 
not be just to him if they should ap- 
pear and “not back up” his charges. 
One of them, he said, had developed 
“cold feet” and was unwilling to 
come. Reminded by Chairman Bran- 
degee that the names must be sub- 
mitted, St. John complied, mention- 
ing first the cousih of one of Major 
Opie’s counsel, sitting across the table. 
it was while St. John was being cross- 
examined by John A. Cutchins, of 

. Richmond! Va., Major Opie’s counsel, 
that he lost control of his shattered 
nerves and dramatically shouted that 
he was dealing with a bunch of 
fanatics Who “are trying to prove I 
am nutty.” Mr. Cutchins promptly 
disclaimed such an intention. 

Seeing that the young man was 
worn out by excitement, Senator Wat- 
son, democrat, Georgia, whose charges 
of illegal executions are unde.’ inves- 
tigation, declined to question him. To- 
morrow Major Opie will testify in his 
own behalf. 

Tells of Finding Rope. 
Starting out with the testimony of 
Rufus P. Hubbard, of New York, who 
was an embalming assistant with the 
American graves registration service, 
declared he found a noose and black 
cap on the bodies of three American 
soldiers dug up in the little French 
cemetery at Bazoilles, the committee 
permitted the inquiry to run its own 
course. Right after the testimony of 
Hubbard, another witness, who assist- 
ed in a legal execution, declared that 
the body was buried, noose and black 
cap intact, in the same cemetery where 


Hubbard said three had been found.

DOCUMENT DIFFERS 
FROM ORIGINAL PAPER 


De Valera Offer Contains 
No Oath of Allegiance, 
But Makes King Asso- 
ciation Head. | 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
Dublin, January 4.—Eamon de 


evening, produced for the first time | 


+, publicly his alternative proposals to 


Policy for Federal ant 


the Irish treaty. A fortnight ago 
he was asked by Arthur Griffith to 
publish. ‘them and Mr. Griffith re- 
peated -his challenge at today’s debate. 

Mr. de Valera’s original idea: as 
announced by himéelf, was to move his 
altervative proposals in the event of 
rejection of the treaty. But, he 
changed his mind, and now intends, 
if “he is permitted, to move them as 
an announcement to the resolution ap- 
proving the treaty. 

The document, whose secrecy has 
been carefully guarded, except for ob- 
scure hints by dail members who saw 
it in the private sessions, was issued 
to the press, accompanied by an ap- 
peal by Mr. de Valera in a mani- 
festo addressed to the Irish people, 
urging them not to be stampeded in 
the support of the treaty, which would 
not bring peace. 

Difiters from Original. 

The document as issued differs, ac- 
cording to Mr. Griffith, from the docu- 
ment submitted in the private ses- 
sions of the dail eireann. It follows 
the main outline of the treaty made 
at the Downing street residence of the 
British prime minister and signed by 
Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and 
the other plenipotentiaries, but im- 
plies, Mr. de Valera contends, a fun- 
damental differen¢e in principle. It 
asserts that the sole-source of author- 
ity in Ireland rests: with the Ivish, 
[while by the treaty, it is argued, it 
is derived through the.king. . ) 
e Valera’s plan contains no 
oath of allegiance, but admits recog- 
nition of his Britannic majesty as 
head of the assotiation of ‘states in 
the British commonwealth with which 
Ireland externally associates itself. 

The debate today revealed the pres- 
ence of at least three parties in the 
dail ireann—the supporters of the 
treaty made in London, the supporters 
of Mr. de Valera and his alternative 
proposals, and some active republicans 
opposed to both sets of proposals. 
Vigorous speeches were made for and 
against the treaty, but at the con- 
clusion of the session there was no 
indication of any change in the sen- 
timent of the members, and the best

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 4.—After a 
five-day mew year’s breathing space 
the arms negotiations were resumed 
today with an impetus that swept most 
of the trouklesome problems of the) 
conference almost to the. point of gl 
cision. ’ 

Uppermost among the separate dis-| 
cussions which appeared tonight to be 
approaching a conclusion as the con- 
troversy between® the Japanese and 
Chinese over Shantung. It was in- 
dicated that the conversations might 
end tomorrow one way or the other, 
and that the predominating belief was 
that the result would be an agreement 
rather than a final deadlock. 

There was outward indication to- 
night after the Chinese and Japanese 
had resumed their “conversations” on 
the subject, that either side had aban- 
doned its former position regarding 
the troublesome issue that deveioped 
over the mode of payment for the 
Kiaochow-Tsinanfu - railroad in the 
former German leasehold. 

Nevertheless, the joint communique 
issued by the two delegations after 
their meeting said the discussions 
would be “completed” tomorrow and 
there was apparent in many quarters 
a confidence that a final means of set- 
tlement would. be-found. 

At the meeting both delegations en- 
tered directly into a discussion of the 


three alternative plans of payment for| | 


the disputed railroad, but adjourned 
after a session lasting more than two 
hours, without definite .action being 


Ps 
» 2 ° , {o, a 
+e - » *, * - ‘ " abe 


The Japanese delegation was said to 
have reasserted its demand for pay- 
ment by loans to the Chinese govern- 
ment through Japanese bankers 
which the Chinese declined to con-’ 
sider. © 

A final agreement was also in sight 
on the question‘of a revised Chinese 
tariff. After a long argument the 
tariff subcommittee came together on 
a proposal to increase China’s tariff 
schedules under an international com- 
mission plan and the far eastern com- 
mittee of the whole is expected to 
ratify the decision tomorrow. 

Among naval experts such progress 
was made with technical details of 
the naval limitation plan that in some 
quarters it was declared final dispo- 
sition of the subject was only a ques- 
tion of hours. Precise regulations 
for scrappiig ships and details of 
replacement were numbered among the 
day’s agreements in the naval sub- 
committee, 

On the question of submarine reg- 
lations, ewhich has waited on further 
advices from the foreign capitals, Ja- 
pan contributed another step toward 
decision by accepting in principle the 
Root resolutions proposing to outlaw 
the use of submarines against mer- 
chant vessels and to make viola- 
tions acts of, piracy. Italy alone re- 
mains to accept the propositions and 
a discussion bythe full committee 
may take place late tomorrow. 

New Troubles Ahead. 

At tomorrow's meeting of the Far 
Eastern committee, however, new 
troubles may be encountered through 
China’s request that the famous “twen- 
ty-one demands” be brought up for 
conference discussion. A protest was 
lodged by Japan just before the last 
meeting of the committee adjourned 
and what promises to be a stubborn 
debate is expected by some delegates 
before the point is decided. 

In some quarters, also, considera- 
ble discussion ig believed likely be- 
fore there is a definite decision on 
the Root submarine proposals. 

France has indicated a desire to 
see some of the terms of the reso- 
lutions fully discussed and clearly 
defined, and although the French said 
tonight they did not propose to press 
the point, it was indicated that some 
troublesome points probably would be 


injected into the conversations soon- 
er or later by someone of the foreign 


wers. 
Meantime the American advisory 
committee met and canvassed opinion 
of the submarine question with the 
result that the committee’s previous 
position for retention of under-water 
craft within strict regulations was re- 
affirmed. Members said a survéy of 
editorial comment and publie opinion 
generally convinced them that the 
American people strongly desired that 
submarine operations be brought with- 
_ the consideration: of humane war- 
are. 


Treaty Nears Completion.

treaty which will explicitly defind the

CLARKE WILL ACCEPT 
TYLER RESIGNATION 


Will Not Appoint Any 
One in Her Place, But 
‘Will Take Full Charge 
of Propagation _Depart- 
ment. 


Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler, associate of 
Edward Young Clarke, imperial 
| kleagle of the Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan, who for many months has been | 
under fire in the Ku K'‘ux controver- 
sy, Wednesday laid before Kleagle 
Clarke her resignation as an official 
of the propagation department of the 
klan, according to a formal 
statement issued by her Wednesday 
night. ! 

The resignation of Mrs. Tyler, the 
only woman connected with the klan, 
will be accepted by Mr. Clarke. se! 
said that he would be forced to do 80 
on account of the condition of her 
health. 

In submitting her resignation, Mrs. 
Tyler declares that her action was 
guided solely by the fact that her 
daughter, Mrs. Dorris Manning Jett, 
is now lying at death’s door, and that 
she herself has been ordered by her 
physician to give up all activities im- 
mediately. 

Has Kept Promise. 

Mrs. Tyler also states that she has 
kept her promise to remain with the 
klan until enemies of the organization 
“have heen silenced,” and in resigning 
she expresses the hope that the klan 
will continue to “grow and carry on 
its struggle for pure Americanism.” 

Mr. Clarke, when asked if he would 
accept Mrs. Tyler’s resignation, stated 
that he would ‘be compelled to do so, 
would not appoint anybody in her 
place, but would himself take full 
charge of the work of the propagation 
department of the klan. 

“Mrs. Tyler’s resignation was given | 


I had.with her,” said Mr. Clarke. 
“IT have been expecting it for two 
weeks, following a conversation I had 
at the time with her physician, who 
stated that Mrs, Tyler's health posi- 
tively demanded that she cease all 
business activities immediately. 
Compellied to Quit. 

“There is no question for me to de- 
cide in the matter. Mrs. Tyler is com- 
pelled to quit and, much against my 
will, I am forced to accept her resig- 
nation. During the height of the at- 
tacks on the klan, I asked Mrs. Tyler 
to stick to her post as long as possible, 
despite her pdor health. She has done 
so and we have weathered the storm. 
Everything is in fine shape and the 
work will be pushed harder than 
ever.” 

In answer to a question, My. Clarke 
stated that since Mrs. Tyler had never 
been a member of the klan, her resig- 
nation from the propagation depart- 
ment would sever entirely her connec- 
tion with the klan. 

Mrs. Tyler has been 
constant fire since the 
attack on the organization’ was 
launched several months ago. Her 
name and that of Kleagle Clarke were 
coupled in sensational charges, and at 
one time county police here said that 
an attempt was made to shoot Mrs. 
Tyler at her home on the Howell Mill 
road. 

According to officials, Mrs. Tyler 
has never been a member of tha klan, 
and her resignation as a member of 
the propagation department severs en- 
tirely her connection with the organi- 
zation. 

Mrs. Tyler’s Resignation. 

Mrs. Tyler’s resignation reads as 

follows:

' BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 4.—Debat@on 
the Dyer anti-lynching bill got under 
way today in the house despite a de- 
termined filibuster on the part of 
democratic opponents of the measure. 
Three hours were spent in roll calls 
demanded by Representative Garrett, 
Tennessee, democratic leader, in a 
futile attempt to head off discussion. 

Half of that time jater was given 
over to debate by Representative Dyer, 
republican, Missouri, author of the 
bill, and Representative Sumners, 
democrat, Texas, one of the leaders in 
the fight against it, who reiterated 
arguments advanced by them in the 
majority and minority views of judi- 
clary committee members when the 
bill was favorably reported. 

The measure is to be set aside to- 
morrow for consideration of the treas- 
ury appropriation bill, which will have 
right of way until it is sent to the 
senate. Representative Mondeil, re- 
publican leader, in a’ statement today 
predicted a vote in the near future on 
the Dyer bill, but stated that debate 
on it’ would be. interagreed with ya- 
tious appreprigtien bills’ which, will 
come from tht house appropriations

told of a number of lyncnings that had 
occurred where the man killed had 
not been guilty of attacks on women. 
During \his remarks Mr. Dyer paid 
tribute to the service rendered by 
negro soldiers overseas and vontended 
that members of that race were en- 
titled to protection from the federal 
government. 

Mr. Suanners, attacking the author 
ity for a number of Mr. Dyer’s statis- 
tics on lynchings, declared passage 
of the bill would increase rather than 
decrease mov violence and would have 
a tendency to engender race hatred. 
He assailed the *measure on constitu- 
tional grounds, contending 't would be 
an invasion of states’ rights and de- 
voted much’*of his time to discussion 
of the constitutional phase of the 
question. 


FRAUD 1S CHARGED

Federal Grand Jury In-|' 


dicts Score in Connec- 
tion With New York 
Liquor Withdrawals. 


‘BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
New York, January 4—A _ bomb- 
shell was exploded today in New York 
federal prohibition headquarters.

hamton attorney, who formerly served 
as federal prohibition director for the 
state of New York, headed the list of 
a score of defendants charged with 
conspiracy to defraud the government 
through liquor withdrawals. 
Immediately public attention, focus- 
ed on poison liquor consumed during 
the holidays, which today claimed its 
nineteenth victim, switched to the 
flood of real alcoholics which were 


alleged to have been loosed through| po, yo 


putative fake drug coneerns. 
Indicted with Hart were two other 
high enforcement officials, three poli- 


ticians and a number of the “drug” 
concerns and their officers. The list 


of defendants included: Thomas Red- 
dy, formerly allied with the post. of- 
fice department and department of 
justice, and who later served as Hart’s 
assistant before the latter's resignation 
last fall. |

office, with a key to the cabinet con-

SENSATIONAL STORY 
TOLD BY MRS. HARVEY 


Mrs. Williams Declares 
That She Did Not Shoot 
Until Obliged to in Or- 
der to Defend Honor. 


Recital by Mrs. Estelle Williams, 
charged with. murder, of events lead- 
ing up to the shooting of N. L. Post, 
engineer for the Seaboard Air Line. 
whom, she stated, she had not seen for 
two years previous to the night of the 
kiHing, sensational testimony of Mrs. 
Alma Harvey, a member 6f the par- 
ty the night of the slaying, and the 
introduction of witnesses by the state 
in rebuttal, who swore that they had- 
seen Post’s automobile in frout of the 
Williams home on several occasions 
prior to the shooting, were outstand- 
ing features of the afternoon session 
Wednesday of the trial of Mrs. Wil- 
liams in Fulton superior coukt before 
Judge John D. Humphries. 

The trial, which began Wednesday 
morning, will probably be concluded 
Thursday. During the morning ses- 
sion, Dr. George Noble testified that 
he believed that the dead man was 
shot through the back. 

The first witness called during the 
afternoon was City _Officer Evans, 
who stated tk’: he arrived at the 
house soon alter the shooting, as he 
lived near the Williams home. He 
declared on the stand that Mrs. Wil- 
liams “had been drinking to a right 
smart extent.” 

Mrs. Williams’ Statement, 

Mrs. Williams, who. made a state- 
ment in ber own behalf, which was 
17,000 words long, declared that she 
shot Post after he had thrown ber 
to the floor-in her own kitchen and 
called her vile names. 

The defendant started her story by 


friend, Mrs. 
Garnett street, whom she had missed, 
Post came along in his automobile and 
offered to take her home. 

“I recognized Mr. Post as a man 
I met about seven years ago, and had 
only seen two or three times since, the 
last time about two years ago. He 
said that he was going out to see 
friend on Georgia avenue, and he 
would be glad to take me home. 

“When we arrived at my house, he 
asked to use the-telephone, and | 
told him to come in and use it. I 
phoned Mrs. Harvey, and she was not 
in, so I told them to tell her to wait 
at the house for me, as I was coming 
un there soon. ‘Then Mr. Post used 
the phone and called his wife and 
told her that he was coming, home, 
and for her to be ready, as he had tu 
be back down town at 7:30 to keep an 
engagement. I was standing in. my 
room fixing my hair, and I could hear 
what his wife said, and she said, 
‘If you can’t stay when you come 
home, you need not come at all,’ and 
hung up on him. ‘Then Mr. Post 
said, ‘What do you think about a wife 
that will treat her husband like that.’ 
and I said nothing.”

they stopped at the home of sr.

‘elared that Curtis came out on the 
porch and that after she was intro-

get out of the car, come in and see 
his mew apartment. She said that 
she did in and there met another 
man. told t.- jury that a large

Curtis, and then he insisted } that

Curtis insisted and stated that he

_ », According to the statement, the en- 


tire party went to town in Post’s car, 
and let the other man out, whose name 
was not given, at the Kimball house. 
‘From there, she said that they drove 
to the Terminal! station, and Post 
went inside while she sat and talked 
‘with Curtis. In about five minutes 
Post returned with a man who was 
introduced as Mr. Bell. The party 
then proceeded to the home of Mrs. 
Harvey's mother. on Garnett strect. 

I thanked Mr. Post for bringing 
me there,” the defendant continued,

of: taking us home as I thought that 
he was going to do, he went back to

take another little drink.’ I refused

Mrs. Harvey to dress and when we 


told Bell if he could not talk to “these 
| ladies decently don’t speak to me 
again. ‘ 

Curtis called @ taxicab for Bell and 
he left the party, whereupon, stated 
Mrs. Williams, when she and Mrs. 
Harvey attempted to go, Curtis got 
in front of the door and declared 
that they were going ‘to spend the 
night there. To make his statement 
more emphatic, Mrs. Williams stated 
that he got a pistol and pointed it 
at her, and said “the first d——n_ one 
of you that starts out of that door 
will be shot down.” 

Got Down on Knees. 

“I got down on my knees,” she 
said, “and begged him to let us out 
and not to kill us and he jerked my hat 
off and stamped on it with his feet 
and yelled that he would stamp on 
me just like he was stamping on that 
hat. He got a baby carriage, put the 
pistol in that and ran around the 
table singing. He calmed down in a 
minate, and said, ‘let’s take another 
drink,’ and when he and Mr, Post 
had gone to the kitchen to get the 
drinks, saAlma and°*I slipped out of 
the -house and had gotten about a 
block, when the men overtook us and 
Curtis grabbed me and said g—d you, 
I’ve handled wild women like you 
before. and you needn’t try to pull 
this stuff on us.” 

After a near fight on the street, 
which Mrs., Williams related in de- 
tail, the party got in the car, Mrs. 
Williams, so she stated, under force, 
and the last ride started. She de- 
clared that they went out on Stewart 
avenue, and that she was protesting 
all the way and begging to be taken 
home, and that Curtis was sitting in 
the back of the car, hitting her on 
the back, pinching her and calling 
her vile names, which she repeated to 
the jury. 

Said Let’s Go Home. 
“Finally, Mr. Curtis said ‘Tet’s go 
home. If it wasn’t for you, we would 
be having a nice party tonight,’” the 
defendant said, “and I told Mr. Post 
that I could not stand any more of 
that stuff and if he did not make 
Mr. Curtis stop, I was going to Jump 
out of the car, and he replied that 
if I could jump out of a car that was 
going as fast as he was going, I was 
welcome: to try.” 

When the party arrived at the 
home of Mrs. Williams, she declared 
that she begged the two men to leave, 
and told them that her husband was 
not at home and they could not come 


in. 

“Then Mr. Post said that he had 
indigestion and would have to have 
some soda and I told him tu go to a 
drug ‘store and get some. He kept 
on begging for some soda so I told 
them to wait on the porch until I 
could go into the kitchen and get the 


soda. 

“When I went Mr. Post followed 
me and when I handed him the soda 
he knocked it all over me. and the 
floor, and grabbed me. - He threw 
me to the floor and I said, ‘Mr, Post 
you must not do anything like you 
bave gone crazy, what is the matter 
with you?’ and I managed to get 


“| away from him and after I got up 


off the floor I went into my room 
to get a brush to get the soda off my 
dress. 

“Began Pinching Her.” 
“He followed me into the room, 
grabbed me again and forced me to 
my knees on the hearth. He held my 
right arm and began pinching me, and. 
he si oneariy killed me, Then 
I pulled up from the floor on the 
mantelpiece, and I put my hand on 
my pistol. 
I was going to shoot him if he did 
not leave me alone.’’ 
Then she stated he was cursing her 
and attempting to attack her again 
when Alma came into the room, and 
she declared that she was going to 
shoot Post if he did not turn her 
loose, and she told Alma to get on out 
of the house and that Alma ran out of 
the house. 
“Then Post said you haven't got 


slap my face and then finally spit in 
it, and I told him I was going to 
shoot and he then called me his beauti- 
ful eyes and other things like. that and 
then slapped me again, and I shot. I 
don’t know how many times I shot, 
but I know that there was nobody else 
in the house.” 

Defendant Weeping. | 
Mrs. Williams was. weeping to- 
wards the end of her narrative. She 
said after she shot Post. he walked 
out and got in his automobile and she 
followed him and told him she was 
sorry she had to shoot him. She said 
that she then phoned the police de- 
partment that she had shot a man, 
and to Grady hospital and asked that 
an ambulance be sent out for the man 
whom she shot. 
All during the trial Mrs. Williams’s 
husband sat by her side. 
Mrs. Harvey was then placed on 
the stand by the defense and upon 
direct examination by Attorney Len 
B. Guillebeau, counsel for the defense, 
corroborated Mrs. Williams’s story. 
Upon cross examination. it was 
brought out that Mrs. Harvey had 
stated before witnesses-that just be- 
fore the shooting Post had said: that 
Mrs. Williams was sick and that he 
had indigestion. She swore that she 
was a block away when the shooting 
occurred and that Curtis was so drunk 
that he did not know what was going 
on. She testified that Curtis was so 
drunk in the automobile that she had 
to hold him up. 
“How long haye you known Mrs. 


| Williams,” asked Solicitor Boykin. 


Knew Her Three Years. 
“Three years,”replied Mrs. Harvey. 
“How many times have you been to 
her house?” 

“About a dozen times,” answered 


q Mrs. Harvey. 


“How many times have you spent 


| the night with her,” queried the solici- 


tor. 
“Hive or six times,” was the answer. 
“Well, how long have you known 
Mr. Williams,” was the next question. 
“T met him after all this thing hap- 
pened,” the witness said. 
Following this witness, the defense 
closed and W. 8S. Rice, who lives 


‘}across the street from Mrs. Williams 


| was called by the state. 


Upon ex- 
amination, Mr. Rice stated that on the 
night of the shooting, two men came 
out of the house and got into the au- 
tomobile after the shots were fired 
and that as the men were coming down 
the steps a woman ran ssed them 
and out on to the sidewalk. He also 
stated that he had seen the same car 
in which he saw the dead man the 
night of the killing in front of the 
Williams home on several occasions, 
before the fatal night. 


the witness, and he was excused. 
Had Seen the 


the nerve to shoot me” and began to} ; 


“You mean to think it is the same 
car?’ questioned Attorney Guillebeau. 
“I know it is the same car,” replied 


|stand by the state. He stated that he 
reached the scene of the shooting soon 
omer it occurred, ers Cea pone Wil- 
iams was in a pretty eondition. 
When asked as to her condition with 
| regard to being intoxicated, he declared 
that “she been drinking right 
smart,” and that one side of her dress 
was unfastened and he asked her to fix 
it. He said that “she told: him that 
Post had told her it .wasn*t soda that 


stated that there was soda’ on her 
dress at the time he came into the 
room. 

Joseph R. Goldsmith, h Barclay 
& Brandon, identified ‘clothing of 
the dead man and stated:that he had 
on this clothing with the éxception of 
his coat when he arrived. 

- Dr. F. W. Haynes was.galled by the 
defense, 

to make an examination®of Mrs. Wil- 
liams’ on the Saturday following 
Thanksigving. He stated:that he found 
a bruise on her right -breast, and on 
her right arm; a small. bruise on her 
left leg, a bruise on he® right leg; a 
small cut on the right thumb. 

No Other Doctor Present. 

* It-was brought out, ongross-examina- 
tion, that Dr. Hayneg yas called by 
Attorney -Guillebeau, @nd had never 
seen Mrs.- Wililams. before the date he 
made the examination at the ‘Téwer. 
and that there was no other phySician 
resent, and that the officials at the 
ower were not notified that such an 
examination was to be made or had 
been made. 

Sherman P. Curtis, a member of the 
party on the night of the shooting, 
was one of the first witnesses call- 
ed after the jury was impaneled. He 
told his version of the affair, and ac- 
cording to his testimony Mrs. Williams 
pecame enraged while under the influ- 
ence of.liquor, because Post had 
placed his hand on the shoulder of 
Mrs. Harvey and applied to her the 
affectionate term of “Cutie.” After 
they arrived at the Williams home, 
he stated that he and Mrs. Harvey 
made several attempts to hide the pis- 
tol, as Mrs. Williams on several oc- 
casions threatened to shoot Post. 


Post Was Sick. 

Curtis testified that on arrival of 
the party at the home of Mrs. Wil- 
liams, Post complained of feeling 
sick, and asked for some soda. Mrs. 
Williams went with him into the 
kitchen, he gaid. On the return of 
the pair to the bedroom, he said, 
Mrs. Williams, for the second time, 
repeated her threat to kill Post, again 
cursing and pulling a pistol. Curtis 
said he and Mrs, Harvey took the 
pistol from her, and that Mrs. Har- 
vey took it out of the room and re- 
ported to him that she had hidden it. 
In the meantime Mrs, Williams 
“got \vorse,” and finally left the 
room, Curtis testified. 


“Threatened Post.” 


“When. she came back into the 
room,” he said, “she again threatened 
to kill Post, pulled the same pistol— 
I have no idea’ where she found it— 
and began firing at Post.’’ 

Curtis declared that Post as he 
fell, again called to Mrs. Harvey, say- 
ing: 

“Cutie, she’s got me—put me in 
the car.” 

W. H. Bell, clerk at the Terminal 
station restatrant, who was in the 
party for a short time, corroborated 
Curtis’ statement of events during 
the time that the former was pres- 
ent. 

The Post shooting came as the cli- 
max of a Thanksgiving eve party par- 


I grabbed it and told-fim ticipated in by Mr. Post, Mrs. Wil- 


liams, Mrs. F. J.’ Harvey and Sher- 
man P. Curtis, in whose apartment on 
East Georg’) avenue a major portion 
of the pari: is said to have been held.

NEWBERRY FIGHT

Newberry, {is conceded generally by 
senate leaders. Mr. Newberry’s sup- 
porters expect a majority of from 
three to seven votes, although a hatr- 
dozen republicans still are listed as 
“doubtful,” with their action said to 
depend in part on whether Senator 
Newberry decided to speak in his own 
right. Some republican leaders were 
reported to have advised the senator 
arainst taking the floor in the senate, 
while others were said to be urging 
that he address the senate. Some

Administration leaders, in diseus-

were said to have determined to insure 
a complete record vote, and were hope- 
ful that an appointment to fill the 
Pennsylvania vacancy, caused by the 
death of Senator Penrose, would be 
made before the roll call. This phase 
of the contest got into the onen senate 
late in the day, through statements 
by Senators Heflin, of Alabama, and 
Caraway, of Arkansas, democrats, to 
the effect that Presiden: Harding or 
some administration leaders were urg- 
ing haste in filling the vacancy. 

Senators Curtis, of Kansas, and 
Wadsworth, of New York, both repub- 
licans, and the former the republican 
whip, responded with a denial that 
the “administration hag had or is go- 
ing to have” anything to do with the 
»hppointment of a new Pennsylvania 
senator. Senator Wadsworth in- 
quired whether Mr. Heflin “knew pos- 
itively’ that the president or his ad- 
visors had taken the course stated, and 
suggested that the Alabama senator 
should investigate before. making the 
assertion.

Washington, January 4.—Negotia- 
~tiens between the government and rep- 
resentatives Henry Ford*for the 
purchase aud lease of the govern- 
ment’s nitrate and water-power proj- 
ects at Muscle Shoals, Ala., will be 
resumed January il. J. W. Worth- 
ington, one of Mr. Ford’s advisers 
in the transacation, notified Secretary 
Weeks today that the Detroit manu- 
facturer would be here in person on 
that date to renew the discussions or 
would authorize his engineers to carry 
the negotiations forward in the event 
he personally could not attend. 

Word from Mr. Worthington that 
Mr. Ford was prepared to continue 
the negotiations was received just as 
Mr. Weeks concluded dictation of a 
letter expressing the wish that the 
conferences, which were halted before 
the holidays, could be resumed with- 
4 out further delay. Earlier in the day 
Senator Underwood, of Alabama, had 
requested the secretary to expedite ac- 
tion on the Muscle Shoals properties 
and was informed, it was said, that 
the department was ready to proceed 
as soon as Mr. Ford was heard from 
and that the delay in the proceedings 
bad not been caused by officials here. 

Would End Negotiations. 

“I am anxious to carry the nego- 
tiations to a conclusioa,”’ the secre- 
tary announced later, “and hav@ just 
dictated a letter to Mr. Ford express- 
ing the hope that there would be no 
more delay in the matter.” 

It was said that Mr. Weeks would 
confer Saturday with C. C. Tinkler, 
president of a San Francisco construc- 
tion company, on an offer he was 
preparing for the Muscle Shoals prop- 
erties, regardless of the Ford nego- 
we scheduled for the following 
WePR, 

Negotiations between the govern- 
ment and private interests for 
the disposal of the 
water power properties at Mus- 
cle Shoals, Ala., were revised _ to- 
day in a conference between Secre- 
tary Weeks, of the war department, 
and Senator Underwood, of Alabama. 
The senator was given to understand

men throughout the invisible empire, 
and to the many thousands 1 have 
personally promised to stand by the 
guns until the fight wa: won, and to 
the many thousands of you who have, 
by resolution and otherwise, expressed 
your implicit confidence in me, who 
am only a woman, with no official eon- 
nection with your noble orzanization, 
I believe it my duty to inform you 
that I have this day laid before Mr. 
E. Y. Clarke, imperial kleagle, and 
head of the department of propaga- 
tion of the Knights of the Ku Klux 

an, my resignatjon. to take effgct 
im.nediately. 

“I had hoped that when my prom- 
ise to you to stand by the guns until 
the enemy had been vanquished was 
fulfilled, I would do so with a feeling 
unmixed with sorrow, except in so far 
as the severance of relations with men 
composing the most dauntless organi- 
zation. known, would naturally cause. 
However, in informing you of the 
splendid victories you bave won at 
every point, I do so with the exul- 
tation I should naturally feel, dead- 
ened by the hand of the grim reaper 
which hovers at this moment over my 
home. 

“For many weeks my daughter has 
been confined. to her bed, under the 
constant care of physicians, and I 
have been informed that her condi- 
tion is so grave that there is little 
hope for her recovery. At a time 
when every one who has had an 
active part in the fight for the right 
of white protestant America to ore 
ganize, should be making merry. I 
am forced to leave you with a heavy 
heart. No one but a mother can 
realize my anguish as I sit by the 
bedside of my first-born, knowing 
that she must go. 


Tells of Gratitude. 


“However, standing as I am in the 
Valley of the Shadow, I cannot sever 
my relations with you without first 
assuring you of my gratitude for the 
wonderful privilege that has been- ac- 
corded me, in being so situated that 
I eould come into contact daily with 
hundreds of you and have come to 
know you and to thank you for the 
wonderful spirit and the practice of 
real, practical fraternalism, as shown 

you, in your devotion to the prin- 
ciples which you have espoused, and 
the wonderful manner in which you 
have stood by me, who am not a mem- 
ber of your organization; and to as- 
sure you that my heart shall always 
be, as it is now, with you, every one, 
That my prayers shall be that every 
woman in our glorious country shal] 
come to realize the necessity for an 
organization of men who unselfishly 
serve and sacrifice for the right. 
Men, who, without fear of punish- 
ment, or the hope of reward, give 
out of the bounty of their hearts to 
those who stand in need. 

“IT could not leave you without first 
assuring you of my deepest and most 
heartfelt thanks for the wonderful 
manner in which you, the members 
of an organization dedicated to the 
protection of womanhood. have stood 
by me and fought mv battles. and the 
battles of the organization, to a sue- 
cessful conclusion. 

“As the only woman who has come 
in actual contact with you, | wish 
to urge upon «you the necessity for 
your continued clannishness as an or- 
fanization and to impress upon you 
the fact that you and the organization 
are making the last stand of the Cau- 
casian race for the principles of an 
unadulterated Americanism. 

What Organization Means. 
'“No one but a women, why by your 
rules is debarred from participation 
in your secret deliberations, but who 
has sfood by and seen the practical 
exenfplifications of your principles in 
your daily life, can fully realize what 
your organization means to the wom- 
anhood of America. I am sorry in- 
deed that every mother worthy of the 
name could not have the privilege ac- 


corded me, and have known you as Il

San Francisco, Cal., January 4— 
Senator Hiram W. Johnson, of Cali- 
fornia, has aligned himself with the 
opponents of the quadruple Pacifie 
trea F 


ty. 

Breaking his silence on this ques- 
tion, Senator Johnson, in a lengthy 
statement, issued Wednesday night, 
said that the big question to be ans- 
wered before the treaty ‘s ratified by 
the senate is “shall the United States, 
either joinfly with Great Britain and 
France, or separately, guarantee or 
underwrite Japan” and his argument 
is that this is what the treaty does. 

“There” was universal ate of 
the original purpose of the Washington 
conference,” he said, “and substantia! 
unanimity in the hope and desire that 
armaments would be limited. 

“Any results, just to the partiei- 
pants, lessening armaments’ will be 


and would make almost any sacrifice | 
for peace, is no reason why we should 
accept anything which may be tend- 
ered as in the sacred name of peace 
or under the guise df disarmament. 
“Out of the secrecy of the confer- 
ence has come, first, an unexpected 
treaty, unrelated to the original pur- 
pose of the gathering and unconnected 
in reality with the limitation of armas 
ments. : 


prayers would mingle with mine for 
your success as an organization; for 
viewing the struggles you have made, 
and are making, impersonally, 1 am 
fully convinced that you are now 
making a lagt stand of the Caucasian, 
and tuat should you fail, the institu- 
tion of motherhood will be a mock- 
ery. 
“It has been my privilege above 
all others to know that your motto, 
‘Not for self, but for others,’ is no 
idle fraternalism, but is the practice 
of a real fraternalism, and not mere- 
ly uttered for the pleasant sound pro- 
duced upon the ear. It has been my 
privilege to see you, as no other has 
been privileged to see you. 

“I wish particularly to express my 
gratitude to the members of Nathan 
Bedford Forrest Klan No. 1, Atlanta, 
for their re stand in my be- 
half, a stand not exacted by them 
through any other notice than their 
unqualified support of one of the 
great fundamental principles of their 
organization—the protection of wom- 
anhood—and to the _ klavaliers for 
their many acts of kindness, and the 
wonderful support they have given lo- 
cally in my behalf. 

Thanks Klansmen. 
*]l wish to thank the hundreds of 
klans who have passed resolutions, 
and who have sent delegations to At- 
lanta to assure me of their ‘hearty 
support in the fight that 1 have made 
personally and for the organization. 
“In this fight 1 have been malicious- 
ly persecuted, died about, and shot at,

ed. The enemy will stop at nothing 
but you have won, for no earthly pow- 
er can break the spirit of klansmen.

tee’s recommendation that the com- 
mission create a position to be known 
as tax investigator of Fulton county. 
The recommendation said that the in- 
vestigator’s duties would be to “assist 
the tax collector in making investiga- 
tions and collections; to check county 
digests as soon as available, with those 
of the city of Atlanta; to check all de-

trace to present owners and collect de- 
linguent tax; check all business con- 
cerns and professional men for per- 
sonal property; to make real estate 
books of East Point, College Park and 
Hapeville for use of county assessors 
and tax collector. The recommenda: 
tion further recommended that J. T. 
Smith, be elected to the position. The 
recommendation was referred to the 
alms and juveniles committee. 

A report on the financial condi- 
tion of the county was presented at 
the beginning of the meeting by James 
L. Repress, certified public account- 
ant. The report showed that at the 
start of the new fiscal year, October 1, 
1921, the county had paid all debts. 
and that its total assets amounted to 
$2.996,891.53. It showed also that 


the county had spent during the last 
fiscal year $609,356.79 on road con- 
struction and improvements.

Other features of thefreport are that 
the county borrowed “uring the last 
fiseal year the sum of $617,550 and 
paid notes and accounts amounting to 
$563.411.13; and the following ex- 
penditures were made by the county in 
running the courts and other depart- 
ments: $122,321.71. superior courts; 
$50.083.49. two divisions of the city 
court: $109.435.06, five divisions of

whites: $18,474.25. industrial farm 
for negroes, and $23,835.49, tax re- 


ceiver’s fee for making 1920 digest. 
Another report presented to the 

board Wednesday was e by H. W. 

Wood, secretary, which is a tentative 


estimate of the expenditures for the 
seounty during the fiscal year ending 


September 30, 1922, and which does

jeave in the treasury on October 1, 
1922, the report declares, an amount 
totaling $389,451.04. The report adds 
that only current expenses have been 
provided for, and have not provided 
for the purchase of any material for 
road building or for any contract work. 
Boykin Request Denied. 

A request by Solicitor John A. Boy- 
kin for the refund of money aproxi- 
Later the 
solicitor appeared personally before 
the board and asked that the refund 
be made. He said that the board 
should refund the $198.80 which he 
had paid personally in bringing Ed- 
ward H. Stanley, forger, from Dallas, 
Texas, in the latter part of1920. “It 
was an emergency caze,” declared the 
solicitor, “and no time was to be lost. 
I gave J. H. Doyal a check for $200, 
and he immediately went to Dallas 
and returned with Stanley, who was 
convicted and sentenced. The refund 
of the $52.48 which I supplied to pay 
the expenses of County Officers W. A. 
Raley and J. L. Peacoock, when they 
went on the trail of bunco gang mem- 
bers to Augusta and Aiken, 8. C., I 
don't push.” However, the board 
again denied both requests, 

Will Aid in Road Work. 

W. R. Neel, of the state highway 
department, appeared before the com- 
mission and asked that it appropriate 
a small sum for the uncompleted road 
in Clayton county, which will connect 
up a good road into. Atlanta from 
Newnan. The request was granted. 

W. Tom Winn, president of the 
State Highway association, also ap- 
peared before the commission to tell 
why the commission should send a 
member to the road building and road 
equipment convention. which will be 
held from January 17 to 20. Com- 
missioner Mills.said that Sit will be 
profitable for all of the members to 
go to Chicago.” It was then moved’ 
that all members who so desired can 
attend the convention at the county’s 
expense. The motion was passed, 
only Commissioner Turner voting 
“nay.” 

No action was taken on the re- 
quest by Solicitor Boykin that J. W. 
LeCraw be named to fill the vacancy 
which will be caused soon by the resig-

VALERA TO PRESS 
ALTERNATE OFFER 


Continued from First Page. 


informed opinion continues to incline 

to the belief that the treaty will be 

approved by a small majority. 
Heated Controversy. 


When the motion for adjoutnment 
was made tonight, Mr. de Valera’s an- 
nouncement that he would move to- 
morrow ah amendment to Mr. Grif- 
fith’s motion in favor of the treaty 
his own alternative proposals, gave 
rise immediatety to a heated con- 
troversy. Mr. Griffith, who, like the 
other members. had received a copy 
of the proposals, szid: 

“Are we to consider this a new doc- 
ument, or document No, 2?” referring | 
to the De Valera plan to which fre- 
quent reference has been made in the 
debate. 

De Valera jumped up and 
“You are quibbling.” 

Griffith retorted: 


said: 
“Document Ne, 2 


ment consists of 17. 
omitted.” 

Further controversy then arose re- 
garding whether De Valkera’s proposals 
could be moved’as an amendment at 
all, as they have been described on the 
agenda paper as a separate motuuu. 
One deputy urged that the new pro- 
pos8ls embodied a policy to follow on 
the rejection of the treaty, and not ! 
as an amendment to it. Mr. De Valera | 
said: 

“I am responsible; I am going to 
choose my own procedure now.” 

Mr. Griffith replied that it was not 
within the competence of Mr. De Va- 
lera to do so, as the dail eireann was 
a constituted body. 

To Use Own Terms. 

‘T am going to propose my own 
amendment in my own terms, and it: 
will be for the house to decide,” re- : 
torted De Valera. , 

_ The session then adjourned until 11: 
o'clock tomorrow morning, when the 
proceedings are expected to take the 
form of a discussion on the rules of 
order to determine whether De Valera 
can move his proposals as an amend- 
ment or must wait until the dail 
eireann has given a direct vote on the 
treaty. According to the speaker's 
tentative ruling, an amendment may 
not be moved without the consent of 
the house, and it is possible that a 
critical division may really occur on 
the motion submitted to enable De 
Valera to move his proposals on his 
way.

BRIAND:AND-GEORGE 
CONFER AT CANNES 


Cannes, 
ment “in principle” exists between 
Great Britain and France on a gen- 
eral scheme for the stabilization of 
exchanges, according to reports which 
followed the first conferences between 
Liloyd-George and Premier Briand aft- 
er Briand’s arrival -here. 

The advent of the French delega- 
tion to Cannes was the signal for 
an immediate gathering of the oppos- 
ing leaders in a preliminary discus- 
sion of the problems which will be 
brought before the supreme council. 
In addition to the two premiers, Min- 
isters Louis Loucheur and Sir Robert 
Iiorne yarticipated in the conversa- 
tions. 

“The situation is delicate,” \ said 
Loucheur just before the informal 
session began. “We are walking on 
eggshells and we cannot continue in 
this way. We must come to some def- 
inite decisions on many questions.” 

Members of the French deiegation 
are unanimous in declaring that Bri- 
and offers to allay all England’s anx- 
ieties regarding hér naval policy if 
Lloyd-George is willing to give France 
guarantees of security in tke form of 
a closer entente or something in the 
nature of an alliance in order to prove 
to the world that France's attitude at 
Washington and London has resulted 
only from a lack of such guarantees 
for her safety. 

It is understood that Lloyd-George 
and Briand in private conversation 
took up the general Franco-British 
situation that has arisen as a result 
of France’s position at the arms con- 
ference. The discussion will be con- 
tinued Thursday.

Knowing 


Dip a brush into the 
average paint and spread 
it on. What happens? 


bh oe; find it takes a surprising amount 
of brushing to get it to cover evenly. 
Also that in spite of all your repeated 
attempts, it still shows a lot of brush marks 
or series of fine ridges. 


Between every one of those ridges is a 
valley streak or thin spot. 


That paint, then, is only as strong as those thin streaks. 


Now di, your brush into a can of our High Standard Paint and 
spread it on. What happens? You are promptly surprised at 
the quickness and thoroughness with which it coVers. 


Likewise the way it has of smoothing itself out, leaving no streaks 
or hills and valleys. Looking at it carefully, you are convinced 
that here is a paint that gives a uniformly strong protective coat. 
One, every inch of which you can depend on its dependability, 


Exactly why this paint of ours does what it does is told in the 
booklet called “Figure Your Painting Cost With a Brush—Not a 
Pencil.” Send for it.

. \GNORED IN BILL 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 
Constitution Bureau. 
| Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, January 4.—(By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.;—In the first 
bill under the new budget plan of 
grouping appropriations by depart- 
ments, which will be taken up by the 
house tomorrow, the general publi¢ 
building item is included, but it 
notable that there 1s not one single 
item of that nature for the souther 
. States, % 
In Georgia alone there have been 
introduced and reintroduced at each 
recurring session since 1915 sixty-odd 
public building bills. Many of these 
have received favorable reports from 
the committee. Many of them, indeed, 
are imperative, where present leased 
postoffices are crowded, or unsani- 
tary, cr wholly unsuited to federal 
uses. and in many instances lots have 
long since been bought and paid for by 
the government and bills authorizing 
the erection of federal. buildings there- 
on iliave already passed the house. 
There are other instances where 
legislation wads fully enacted away 
back in 1916 authorizing the construc- 
tion of federal buildings in Georgia, 
but for which the treasury has to this 
day refused to honor warrants, 
Accepted Cessation. 
During the war when the resources 
a we Of the government were taxed to mo- 
7 * bilize and equip soldiers, the southern 
statcs accepted without a murmur the 
cessation of federal building opera- 
tions in towns and cities not equip- 
ped with government buildings, but 
with the enormous drain upon the 
south by federal ‘taxation, it has a 
right to expect that the postoffice 
plants in the south shall be kept ade- 
quate to demands, and that cities en- 
® titled to federal buildings and not so 
equipped shall be, at least to a limited 
measure, provided for. 
The public buildings in the appro- 
priation bill which comes up for con- 
e sideration tomorrow include principal- 
ly buildings and additions to buildings 
in Washington, and in some of the 
larger federal bnildings of the east. 
Wiile the bill carrying appropria- 
tions for river and harbor work has 
"} not ,et heen presented to the house, it 
Sis ulso assured that the south Atlantic 
will not get a dollar for new projects 
ihis year, with redticed appropria- 
tions for all necessary work, such as 
© dredging in navigable waters, ete. 
No Extension Work. 

i nder the existing rule the alloca- 
tion of funds for river and harbor 
swork is left entirely to the board of 

vy army engineers, and while Savannah 
river will probably get enough money 
| g§' to keep the channel open, and other 
navigable waters in Georgia will be 
kept from actually shoaling, there is 
» net the slightest chance tor any exten- 
sion of work or development this vear 

as slong the lines of former years. 


-GRFFN MADE HEAD 
OF BIG FLORDA BANK 


Announcement of the _ election of 
Jaiues Leslie Griffin. of Atlanta, as 
president of the First National bank 

* of, West Palm Beach, Fla., was re- 
ceived in Atlanta Wednesday by W. 
D. Manley, president of the Bankers 
Trust company, who is a member of 
the board of directors of the West 
,; Palm Beach bank. Mr. Griffin has 
been serving as national bank exam- 
iner assigned as examiner-at-large in 
the sixth federal reserve district, with 
headquarters in Atlanta. He has -re- 
signed this place to accept the posi- 
tion as the head of the Florida bank. 

Mr. Griffin, who has made Atlanta 

‘ his home for several years, originally 
was from Gadsden, Ala. He entered 
the banking business at Montgomery, 

®Ala., as a clerk in the Exchange Na- 
tional bank of that city. He served 
in every department of that bank until 
commissioned as national bank exam- 
iner ussigned to the third federal re- 
@ serve district, with headquarters at 
&” Philadelphia, Pa. Since 1918 he has 
been stationed at Atlanta. 

Two Atlanta men are interested in 
the First National Bank of West 
Palm Beach besides Mr. Griffin, these 

® being Mr. Manley and W. W. Banks, 
vice president of the Citizens and 
Southern bank of Atlanta, both of 
whom are directors in the Florida in- 
stitution. 

In making the announcement of. the 
election of Mr. Griffin as president, 
Mr. Manley declared that the First 
National bank pf West Palm Beach is 
one of the oldest banks in Florida. 

» It has never owed one dollar and has 
never rediscounted a paper. It is the 
only national bank in West Palm 
Beach and: handles a large business 
for northern capitalists who spend 
the winter in Florida. The bank oc- 
cupies one of the most prominent cor- 

“ners in West Palm Beach, and is 

equipped with as complete systems 
of safety deposit vaults and banking 
fixtures as can be found in the south, 

@ according to Mr. Manler. 

Mr. Griffin is in Florida and as- 
eumed his duties as president of the 
bank Wednesday.

This is how Farmer Holden was 
overtaken with bad luck: 

Frank Barron, well-known Kome

He left his automobile in front of 
the latter's residence. 
later, he discovered it had disap-

The sheriff, deputy sberiff and Mr. 
Barron jumped into another car and 
chased the thief. Both automobiles 
were traveling at a high rate of 
speed, with that of the robber gain- 
ing. 

A number of miles from Kome the 
sheriff's car almost ran.into a two-

dustrial missions will be considered 
under the head of this subject. 

Services Wednesday were conducted

BILL OPEN JANUARY 9 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. — 
Constitution Bureau. 


Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, January 4.—( By 
Constitution Leased Wire.)—Geor- 
gians are deeply interested in the hear- 
ings which begin Monday, January 9, 
on the Snell-McCormick national for- 
estry bill. 

The last session of the legislature 
provided a forestry commission, and 
several members of the commission 
will be in Washington at this confer- 
ence. Several forestry enthusiasts 
are already arriving on the scene. 

Among the first to arrive is Charles 
Lathrop Pack. of Lakewood, N. J., 
president of the American Forestry 

ssociation, which is conducting edu- 
cational forestry campaigns through- 
out the country. On the subject of 
the bill Mr. Pack told The Constitu- 
tion today: 

“This measure is of vital importance 


visiting Colicitor-General | to the country* becaust forest products 


enter in a large measure into every 
business in the country. The Snell- 
McCormick bill asks an appropriation 
for increased fire prevention work, 
for reforestation, for other forestry 
work and for buying lands. 
can not be grown in a day and with 
the center of the lumber industry 
nearing the Pacific coast. resulting in 
high freight rates, the business of the 
country demands we begin at once to 
put the millions of idle acres in the 
cast and middle west to work growing 
trees,” 

During the week the following will 
be heard: D. L. Goodwillie, Chicago, 
for forestry committee, United States 
Chamber of Commerce; Colonel W. B. 
Greeley, chief United States forest 
service: George S. Long, Tacoma, for

UNKNOWN PATIENT 


AT U. S. HOSPITAL 
NOW IDENTIFIED 


The man who was found at Decatur 
about two months ago and sent to 
public health service hospital No. 48, 
and who was unable to speak, hear or 
talk with anyone, has been identified 
as Fred Ward, of Weaverville, N. C. 
The identification, made Wednesday 
by a relative who saw the man at the 
hospital, was the result of a newspa- 
per story printed in Atlanta of a 
search for a missing son, by J. N. 
Ward. of Weaverville. 

Red Cress authorities, who had 
been seeking the relatives of Ward, 
commynicated with Mr. Ward in 
Weaverville. with the result that the 
man was identified Wednesday. 

The identification was completed 
Wednesday by Mrs. P. G. West, a rel- 
ative. She said that Ward is only 28 
years old, although he has the appear- 
ance of a man nearer 40. 

He has been a deaf mute for some 
time, Mrs. West said. In an effort to 
travel to Winston-Salem, N. C., she 
said, he continued on to Greenville, as 
he was unable to tell the conductor his 
destination. From Greenville he went 
to Decatur, Ga., where Sheriff Me- 
Curdy found him wandering about and 
theught him a_ shell-shocked former 
soldier. Ward. was sent to the hos- 
vital, 

Considerable improvement in bis 
condition was brought about by treat- 
ment at the hospital. When he left 
for his home Wednesday, however, he 
was still unable to speak, hear or com- 
nfunicate his thoughts in any way. 


MURPHY PLANS FIGHT 
ON PROPOSED CHARTER 


Opposition within city council to 
the revised charter proposed by Coun- 
cilman Edgar Watkins developed into 


an open attack on the new charter | 


Wednesday by Councilman J. C. Mur- 
phy. ' 

The councilman assailed the charter 
as “pernicious” and declared that “as 
drawn by Mr. Watkins it is nothing 
more, or less than the old chamber of 
commerce charter under another 
name.” He declared that under Mr. 
Watkins’ plan “the mayor would be 
nothing but a figurehead, an after- 
dinner speaker, and the aldermanie

that. The manager would be a pow-

not want it.” 

He asserted that he would lead a 
fight in council to block the charter 
in its present form. .

THE FIREARMS TRAFFIC. 

In his annual report covering the 
activities of his office during 1921 
Coroner Paul Donehoo says the 
“indiscriminate use of deadly 
weapons by irresponsible people” 
is one of the chief causes of death 
by violence in this county, and -he 
strongly recommends as a correc- 
tive “the passage of stricter reg- 
ulations governing the sale of fire- 
arms.” ? 

His conclusion as to the deadly 
weapon menace to human life is 
undoubtedly corgect; and his rec- 
ommendation should receive favor- 
able consideration from the legis- 
lature, council, police authorities 
and primarily and above all, by 
the general public. 

It is doubtful, however, wheth- 
the “indiscriminate” use of 
deadly weapons in the hands of 
“irresponsible” people is really a 
greater menace to life and limb 
‘and the public welfare than is the 
intentiona!, premeditated use of 
them by responsible and designing 
people who live by crime and who 
purposely employ ‘weapons of 
death as items of equipment nec- 
essary in their criminal business. 


er 


“+ 4 “But the fact that in the hands 


either of irresponsible people who 
carry them through habit and for 
no specific purpose, or of those 
who carry them for purposes of 
carrying out premeditated crimi- 
nal intentions, deadly weapons 
constitute an ever-present inexcus- 
able and wholly unnecessary and 


indefensible public hazard. : 


Atlanta is dotted with pawnshops 
and hardware stores in which a 
loaded six-shooter can be purchas- 
ed. with as much ease as a house- 
wife can purchase a sack of flour 
from the corner grocery. 

If a drunken negro is carried. to 
the police station, searched and 
his gun taken from him, as soon 
as le is turned loose he can go 
to one of fifty or more shops in 
Atlanta and procure another pis- 
tol, loaded and ready for business, 
with no more difficulty than he 
would experience in buying a séc- 
ond-hand mandolin or a carpen- 
ter’s square. 

A pistol is designed for one pur- 
pose, and one only, and that is to 
kill; and any citizen—whether he 
be a professonal criminal, a drunk- 
en or otherwise irresponsible ne- 
gro or white man—who Ifas one of 
the deadly instruments in his pock- 
et is a potential killer and a walk- 
ing peril to every human being 
who comes within range of his 
weapon, for nobody knows at what 
instant he may take a notion to 
use it. | 

Coroner Donehoo’s point is well! 
taken. 

There should be more stringent 
regulations covering both the pur- 
chase and the possession. of deadly 
weapons, and to more adequately 
safeguard the public against this 
menace to life and law and order.

IT CAN’T BE CHANGED. 

A Belgian military commander | 
proposes to atrike the name of 
Waterloo. from the map and sub- 
stitute that of “Loncin,” because, 
as alleged, the name of the famous 
fi is supposed to “humiliate 
F e.” 

It is pointed out that France has 
offered no recent objection to it, 
but Belgium thinks the elimination 
of Waterloo would be graciously 
received and have a. tendency to 
promote. even friendlier . relations 
between ‘the two countries. 

‘That is carrying brotherly feel- | 
ing pretty fan; byt the world won't 
stand for that invasion of its rights 
ia the unchristening of its favorite 
battleground, which will be Water- 
loo\to the world forever. * .-

There is no strong reason for

WOOD ALCOHOL’S TOLL. 
New Yofk, it seems, prohibition 
or.no prohibition, was “hell-bent”; 


time” on New Year’s*night, and in 
the traditional way—that is, by 
getting gloriously “lit up.” 

Now, according to news reports, 
it is “beginning to count the tragic 
cost of its holiday ‘celebration.’” 

And the result? 

According to the aftermath re- 
port dated Jaunary 3— 

“Eighteen deaths, elght of them 
caused by drinking wood alcohol, 
and the others due to acute alco- 
holism induced by prohibition 
hooch, are already recorded, and the 
death toll ig not yet complete. 

“Byvery hospital in the city lista in 
the number of its patients from one! 
to a dozen who are suffering from 
the same cause. In two days, at 
BeHevue hospital, 40 patients were 
admitted, some of them blind, some 
paralyzed, some dying. Of these 40, 
five were women. 

“That isn’t all. Murders, assaults 
and suicides, directly traced to bad 
liquor, continue to fill the news col- 
umns.” 


4 


One of the tragic instances re- 
lated is that in which a customs 
official who had been assigned to 
guard a stock of liquor on board 
a foreign ship in the harbor got 
drunk, came ashore with a drunk- 
en companion, shot and killed a 
man for a trivial cause, and “woke 
up in a cell Tuesday afternoon 
and wondered why he wag there.” 
A shoemaker was found 


the steps of his home. ‘He died,” 
says the report, “and analysis 
showed the cause—wood alcohol.” 
A fourth: “An unidentified wom- 
an was found in a hallway clutch- 
ing an empty bottle. She and an 
unidentified man picked up on the 
street will die.” 

One more of the list of trage- 
dies that are mentioned because 
of peculiarly pathetic features in 
connection with them: 


“I killed my wife on Christmas 
day,” said a Perth Amboy carpenter, 
walking into the police. station, 
There had been a quarrel over 
drinking, then murder. The car- 
penter continued drinking until he 
‘thought his wife was calling him; 
and then gave himself up.” 


And so it goes on down the list: 
Men and women—each loving and 
loved by somebody—dying the 
horrible death of drunkards, or, 
worse still, falling paralyzed or 
doomed to lives of blindness, all 
for the sake of having a- “good 
time.” ) 

“Now, when, later on,” says a} 
reader of The Springfield (Mass.) 
Republican, in a communication 
that appeared in a recent issue of 


“The judges find it best to add a | 


will be discouraged, which as al- 
ways, is only carried on for the 
money that is in it.” 

That is the thing from the stand- 
point of the bootleggers and the, 
other traffickers in the vile stuff 
that—‘the money that is in it!” 
The criminal who merely robs 
men of property—of things of in- 
trinsic value only—is the personi- 
fication of virtue as compared

THE BETTER PLAN. 
The New Year farming plan in 
Georgia will be one of greater di- 
versification. 

That is the word which comes 
from practically every farming 
section, and if it is adhered to, the 
farmer will be on the winning side 
at last. 

Speaking for southwest Georgia, 
The Albany (Ga.) Herald says— 


“In the light of an experience that 
has been costly, the conservative 
and level-headed farmer down here 
in south Georgia, where so many 
different crops may be successfully 
produced, is learning the unwisdom 
of putting all his eggs inte one 
basket. In other words, he is begin- 
ning to diversify. It may be al] 
right to plant g6ome cotton, come 
peanuts, some potatoes, some torn 
and some watermelons, but one 
takes great risk when he puts tis 
all into either one of these crops, 
The one-crop farmer May make a 
lucky strike now and then, but the 
one who diversiflieg and gives first

That's the way to beat the boll 
weevil—with home supply crops 
that keep money coming in the 
year round. And it is the only safe 
and certain way. 
The “lucky strikes” made by the 
oné-crop farmer are so few and far 
between, they make but a pour 
showing in the general summing 
up. ; 
That is what the Georgia farm-

why greater home supplies of the 
ever-depepdable crops, will be 
grown another year,

Hollomon Summarizes Conditions as a Whole

Washington, January 4.—(Special.) 
The convening of th branches o 
congress this week, after the holiday 
recess, marked the beginning of what 
will prove to be the most remarkable 
political struggle for legislative mas- 
tery known in this country In a gen- 
eration. 

The decks have been cleared; the 
opeftiing guns have been fired on both 
sides of the battle line; and from 
this date until the close of the sunm- 
mer and fall primaries, not one inch 
will be spared by either the repub- 


the battle progresses. , 

The hope of the democrats is to 
win a majority in the house for the 
sixty-eighth congress and to cut down 
some of the republican majority in 
tk. senate, 

It would be untrue to say that the 
most sanguine democratic leader, 


versed as he may be in the mistakes } 


of the republican administration ana 
congressional majority, could hope to 
win a majority in the senate in the 
primaries. 

It is equally true that a majority 
of the democratic leaders, recognizing 
the enormous numbers in the repub- 
lican majority to overcome in the 
house, do not actually expect to en- 
tirely overcome that majority. 

It is true, however, that every sign 
points to a sweeping democratic vic- 
tory in the congressional elections this 
year; and if the house is not cap- 
tured by the democrats, the purpose 
is to so reduce the republican majority 
that the presidential election of 1924 
will be practically assured for the 
democrats. 

Not only is this the goal in sight, 
but with a formidable minority and a 
slight republican majority, as it is be- 
lieved may be the framework of the 
sixty-eighth congress, the republican 
insurgent movement in the house ard 
the various “blocs,” most prominent 
among which is the agricultural 
“bloc,” may give a - strong mi- 
nority so formidable a leverage that 
the republicans cannot play party 


ceding the next. national election. 

That is the republican objective 
and it is the incentive for the most 
gigantic fight to be waged by the demo- 
erats that the political observers of 
this country have witnessed for many- 
a year. 

DEMOCRATS MAY WIN 
FOUR SENATORS. 

One-third of the entire personne! of 

te senate must be elected in the 
1922 primaries. 
At best, the democrats can only 
hope to gain four senators from the 
states in which republi@ins stand for 
re-election. | 

On the other hand, there is no 
robability, however, of the democrats 
osing a single one of their members 
who stand for re-election. ; 
The senators whose terms expire 
on March 4, 1923, follow: . 
Republicans: Henry Cabot Lodge, 
Massachusetts; Hiram. W. Johnson, 
California; Frank B. Kellogg, Minne- 
sota; Robert M. La Follette, Wiscon- 
sin; Harry 8S. New, Indiana; William 
M. Calder, New York;. Frederick 
Hale, Maine; Porter J. McCumber, 
North Dakota; William E. Crow, 
Pennsylvania; the successor of the 
late Boise Penrose, Pennsylvania; T. 
Coleman Dupont, Delaware; Joseph I. 
France, Maryland; Joseph Ss. Frey- 
linghusen, New Jersey; George fF. 
McLean, Connecticut; Carol S. Page, 


ton; Howard Sutherland, West Vir- 
ginia; Charles -E. Townsend, Michi- 


an. = 
’ From this. list of republican sena- 
tors whose terme are expiring with 
this congress, the democrats will make 
a desperate effort to capture a _ suc- 
eessor to Calder, of New York; 
I'rance, of Maryland; Freylinghusen, 
of New Jersey, and Dupont, of Del- 
aware. They will also attempt to 
capture the seat held by Sutherland, 
of West Virgiina, but this is hardly 
probable, as conditions have apparent- 
ly made West Virginia as rock-ribbed 
republican as Pennsylvania or Ver- 
mont. ae 
vJudging from the state and munici- 
pal elections of last November, how- 
ever, and from the strong democratic 
tide that is running in those states, 
it is entirely possible for democratic 
senatorial candidates to carry _ the 
first four states named, New York, 
New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. 
There is even a fighting democratic 
chance in Connecticut, but this state 
is placed, in the abundance of con- 
servatism, in the same class with West 
Virginia. 

Now, as to the others— 
Democrats: Gilbert M. Hitchcock, 
Nebraska: Atlee Pomerene, @hio; 
James A. Reed, Missouri; John Sharp 
Williams, Mississippi; Henry F.°Ash- 
urst, Arizona; Charles A. Culberson, 
Texas; Peter G. Gerry, Rhode Island; 
Andrieus A. Jones, New Mexico ; John 
B. Kendrick, Wyoming; William H, 
King, Utah; Kenneth McKellar, Ten- 
nessee: Henry VT. Myers, Monfana; 
Key Pittman, Nevada; Claude A 
Swanson, Virginia; Park Trammell, 
Florida. 

The republicans will make a desper- 
ate effort to elect senatorial candi- 
detes from every one of these states 
except Mississippi, Texas, Virginia 
and Florida. ee 
Perbaps the most sepctacular politi- 
cal fights of all will be the republican 
effort to capture Pomerene’s seat from 
Ohio,“Reed’s from Missouri, Ken- 
drick’s from Wyoming and King’s 
from Utah. 

As stated, however, the indications 
are the incumbents will retain all of 
these democratic seats, there being 
an unusually strong democratic tide 
running in Ohio; and the failure of 
this administration to recognize, or, 
certainly, to do anything tangible, for 
the farmer and stock raising vote, it 
is believed, will carry the -inter- 


cratic, 
The present senate is 60 republican 

and 36 democratic. At best, there- 

fore. the sixty-eighth senate cannot 


oeratic ratio than 40 to 56. : 
EVERY HOUSE MEMBER . 
MUST BE ELECTED. 

As everybody knows, the four hun- 
dred and thirty-five members of the 
house are elected for two year terms 
only, and consequently each succeed- 

congressional election involves 
every seat in that body. 

At present the house is more than 
two to one republican, republicans 
having 301 members, and the demo- 
erats 134. It is much easier, however, 
to win a party election for a member 
of the house, who stands before the 
electorate of his own district only, 
than for a member of the senate. who 
stands — the electorate of the 
state at large. 

In the election of 1920, more —_ 


tide. 
In the congressional elections, how- 


-ever, where there is no national in- 


fluence to swing a ballot complete, 
the nominal party complexion of the 
districts stand out more prominently 
and are more an entity. 
Western repub

republican leadership when the reve- 


the house. | 

It is also very clearly illustrated by 
the “bloc” organized between demo- 
crats of ‘the south and republicans of 
the west to force cultural legisla- 
tion, which the administration leaders 
refused to submit or advance. 

Therefore, it is only logical to as- 
sume that the democratic districts of 
the west, temporarily in the republi- 
can column, will be swung back into 
the democratic column in the 1922 pri- 


ri 

And that is not all, republicans in 
the national tide of 1 captured 
democratic districts galore in Virginia 
Oklahoma, Tenness¢e and Texas, a 
of which will probably be brought 
back within the democratic ranks at 
this year’s elections, 

It is a conservative statement to 
say that, while the hope of actually 
wiping out the republican majority is 
too big an order to expect fully con- 
summated during the force and power 
of a republican administration, where 
patronage will necessarily play an im- 
portant part in every state, under the 
circumstances, and in view of the rap- 
idjy growing democratic sentiment 
throughout the country, M is entirely 
possible, and indeed, probable, that 
the democrats will so swell their mi- 
nority that the republicans will have 
to fight.for everything they put over 
in the 68th congress, 

It is this feeling of democratic opti- 
mhism that is sweeping the nation from 
Maine to California; and jt is a realiz- 
ation of this condition that has caused 
no less a man than President Harding 
to take up the reins of party manage- 
ment from his office .in The White 
House, with a daring that is little 
short of desperation. 

There is not a political observer 
in Washington, except the biased par- 
tisans of the administration, who does 
not know that every move that the 
president makes on the checker board 
of national affairs is one of politics, 
pure and simple. 

No. president has ever played the 
game so openly before; and it is to 
be hoped that. no succeeding president | 
will ever again so flagrantly subord- 
inate statesmanship to party success. 

The arms conference was a political 
move to paliate that great element 
in the republican party that believed 
sincerely that the’ treaty of Versailles 
should have been ratified. 

The unemployment conference; the 
capital and labor conference; and now 
the proposed agricultural conference, 
are all moves on the political checker- 
board. 

They are so plain and unmistakable 
that “he who runs may see.” 

The reaction is as inevitable as the 
daylight that follows the night. 


There never has been in the history 
of America so many promises, and res- 


olutions, and talk, and so little - 
ble performances that can ensue to 

benefit of the great masses, during a 
period of post war reconstruction, as 
during the period since the republican 
national campaign began in the sum-/ 
mer of 1920, until this good hour. 

It is needless to say that the ub- 
lican tariff that has almost cl the 
foreign markets to American raw 
products, and that has increased the 
consuming prices of necessary commod- 
ities; a revenue bill that has been 
characterized, even by republican lead- 
ers, as an abortion and a monstrosity ; 
unkept promises; an attitude of utter 
disregard for the interest of the ex- 
service men; and a dissipation of the 
great agricultural- interests of the 
south and west, are some of the big 
issnes that will compel democratic vic- 
tories this vear. re 
SPECTACULAR RACES 
IN DEMOCRATIC STATES. 

Of the senatorial races in purely 
democratic states, perhaps the most 
spectacular will be the contest be- 
tween Governor Westmoreland Davis 
and Senator Claude Swanson, of Vir- 
ginia. . 

Swanson has been governor himself; 
in congress, and for many years in the 
senate, and is a great power in the 
Old Dominion. 

On the other hand, however, Gover- | 
nor Davis, is not only extremely pop- 
ular, but Las built up a formidable 
political machine in the state during 
the past four years in the executive 
chair, 

In Florida there is considerable 
talk of Col. William Jennings Bryan, 
who is now a voting citizen of Miami, 
running against Senator Trammell. In 
well informed circle in Washington, it 
is not believed that Trammell will 
have such serious opposition. 

In Mississippi, the old warhorse of 
southern democracy, John Sharp Wil- 
iams, will voluntarily retire, and 
while ex-Senator Vardaman is an an- 
nounced candidate, representing the 
radical wing of the party, it is quite 
sure that one of the more conserva- 
tive representatives of the party will 
be in the race, and probably win. ~* 

In Texas, Senator Culberson will 
not stand for re-election on account 
ill health, and the fight it is believed,. 
will be between Congressmen Parrish} 
and Blanton. Parrish is a young man 
in -politics, now serving his second 
term, but “struck oil,” and that is a 
strong political factor in Texas. Blan- 
ton is going before the electors of the 
Lone Star as a martyr, having been, 
recently reprimanded by the house, 

Senator McKellar, of Tennessee, 
will also have strong opposition from 
both his own party and from the re- 
publicans. As stated earlier, there is 
little hope for the republicans to make 
any gain in Tennessee, and every in- 
dication is that they will lose what 
they abnormally won in 1920.

Thinks Boll Weevil 
Gloom Has Been . 
Overworked 


The Constitution’s 
Excellence as 
An Educator 


Editor Constitution: In your col- 
umns have recently appeared arti- 


cles that have sounded a note of de- 
spair concerning cotton and its fu- 
ture. It is the same old oOutcry,: 
the same old dispensation of glé6om 
that has followed in the immediate” 
wake of the boll weevil all the way; 
from Mexico—the same that has 
— found to be a gros8 exaggera-. 

on. | 

If the boll weevil pest were as 
bad as.these pessimists: would make 
believe, the 
would have ceased in @ll the terri- 
tory to the west over which the’ 
weevil has carried its conquest. 

But what are the facts? Cotton, 
growing persists in all the boll wee- 
vil territory as the best paying 
fafm crop. Instead of the cotton: 
acreage being reduced to a negligi- 
ble quantity, the census reports 
Show in extensive regions that an 
actual increase has resulted. 

Take Georgia. It has had its bap- 
tism of weevils. This year it had 
the worst “third vear’ known to 
any region. Georgia suffered more 
loss from the boll weevil last year 
than any other southern state, ex- 
cept Oklahoma, The worst damag- 
ed county in all the cotton belt 
was in Georgia—the county of Put- 
nam. But in spite of the hardest 
wallop the weevil) ean give or will 
doubtless ever give to Georgta,: 
What do we find according to the 
latest government ‘figures? Fore 
ty-one per cent of the farm crop 
acreage in Georgia devoted to cot- 
ton in 1921 produced more wealth 
than the other 59 per cent devoted 
to oats, rye, irish potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, hay, peanuts, corn, wheat, 
tobacco, sugar cane, sorghum and 
cowpease put together. 


This in spite of the boll weevil, 
the reduction in fertilizers, and the 


unfavorable season. The statement 
“Cotton Still King in Georgia” ap- 
pearing in the government’s report 
is weld justified. That cotton re- 
mains king in spite of these unpar- 
alled adversities would seem to leave 
no justification for any lugubriows 
wails about the future of this great 
money crop of the south. 


Cotton did not equal: the corn 
acreage in Georgia in 1921. To be 


exact, the atreage devoted to corn. 
— 4,665,000 and to cotton 4,140,- [ 
000. . 

Much !{s being said now in urgent 
demand that the farmer “diversify” 
and get away from the “one crop” 
system of agriculture. Georgia 
and other southeastern states have 
never failed to diversify to a great- 
er extent than is probably general- 
ly appretiated. Nearly 60 per cent 
of Georgia's cultivated acres went 
to other crops than cotton Iast 
year. This was not an exception, 
but as a rule it will be found 
that this crop distribution {s about 
an average. The cotton acreage at 
times has been even lower in per 
cent of the wohle, 


The corn statee of the corn belt 
and the wheat states of the north- 


west do not diversify as much as 
the southeast. After all it is not 
how many crops, but what crops can 
be grown with greatest profit that 
should largely determine the type 
of agriculture. 


The writér is not encouraging the 
maintenance of the present cotton 


acreage in the southeast. The boll 
weevil can not be euccessfully 
fought on land that would not grow 
nealf a bale of cotton to the acre 
before the weevil came. It pays to 
fieht the boll weevil, but it pays 
only on land capable of producing 
more than half a bale to the acre. 


Your correspondents say they 


have tried fighting the boll weevil 
once and failed. Therefore, it, can 
not be done. Over against this are 
hundreds of thousands of cotton 
farmers who are growing cotton 
right along where the boll weevil 
is and has been for years. And over 
against the failures in the use of 
tried and appreses methods are the 
successes of Mén who were not Ais- 
-couraged by. a sinwle failure, But 
profited by their mistakes, learned 
how, and have been uniformly suc- 
cessful.

The most successful cotton farm-

gradually increased the number of 
live stock on the farm both for 
food and work stock purposes; they 
have taken up conservatively at 
first other money crops .guch as 
sweet potatoes, sugar cane, tobac-~-

Unfortunately. during the past year

money crops than cotton, became

was a bad year for al] crops. The

§ BITS OF NEW YORK LIFE 


BY 0. O. MINTYRE 


New York, January 4.—There is 
a serious agitation in Manhattan for 
a later theater hour, Irving Berlin’s 
Musie Box, which has become a ren- 
dezvous for those who like $10 shows, 
is not opening until nearly 9 o'clock. 
Nine ig the hour that it is believed 
will be adopted. 

People are forced sto 
distances, in many Nes to get to 
the treatrical district, and when they 
strike the traffic tides motoring be- 
comes a snail-like process, In fact, 
theater-going has resulted in such 
hours of mad haste that producers suf- 
fer a heavy loss of patronage. 

New York welcomes any little 
leisure in its rushed existente and 
such a fashion will find a permanent 
acceptance. The chief objection will 
be made by the actor. And so highly 
organized is the actor these days that 
he has his way. So far, however, he 
ae not recorded a protest against the 
plan. 

Old fashions, too, are returning to 
the theater this winter. The smartest 
people rattle to the play in giacrer, 
And the promenade, so popular in 
the days of crinolin and hoopskirts, 
has been restored.

day I saw two boldly frotked young 
girls join two adolescents. All lighted 
cigarettes. An usher stepped up apol- 
ozetically to explain that there were 
ladies’ and gentlemen's smoking rooms 
in the corridor. 

“Can’t smoke in this theater?” said 
one of the girls. “Isn’t that price-

In one of those super-haberdasher 
parlors on the avenue—the kind tbat

prospective purchaser, but to satisfy 
curiosity, I stepped in and asked the 
price. It was marked $185. The 
clerk explained that one had to be

barber surgeon to do an exploratory 
operation and incidentally to present 
the victim now and then with an in- 
teresting case of blood poisoning for 
his further amusement and delecia- 
tion, 

“Ingrowing nail” is quite as much 
a misnomer as is “jngrowing hair.” If 
you park your front tire hard up 
againet the sharp curb ahd make quite 
a dent in the tire you don’t deal with 
it as a case of ingrowing curb, The 
nail does not grow into the flesh; 
the flesh (“proud flesh’) grows over 
the edge of the nail. 

A recent examination of the feet 
of 356 ympils in New York schools, 
ranging from grammar school grades 
to teachers’ training classes, showed 
the following defects and deformities: 

Thirty-two per ‘cent of the boys 
and 41 per cent of the girls in a 
grammar school toed out. 

Sixty-four per cent of the pupil 
in the New York Training schoo? for 
teachers toed ont. 

That indicates weakness tending to- 
ward flat foot: Of course a man or 
woman with normal feet toes straight 
ahead. 

Forty-seven per cent of the boys, 
74 per cent of the girls and 86 
poe of the embryo teachers had 7 


eet. : 

That indicates that physical educa- 
tion is still im its ruling infancy in 
New York, and that shoe clerks are 
still good enough “foot specialists” fot 
the average metropolitan simpleton. 

Ten per cent of the boys, 17 per’ 
cent of the girls and 19 per cent of 
the teachers to be ~cre equipped with 
ingrowing nails. Vanity hath harms, 

‘That indicates that the older we 
grow the less we know about the by- 
giene of footwear. 

Ingrowing nails are caused by wear- 
ing shoes too narrow, too pointed and 
too far outflared from the natural 
straight inside sole line. This vani- 
ty is almost as prevalent Rmong per- 
sons purporting to be of the mascu- 
line sex as it is among pupils in the 
New York training school for teach- 
ers. There are still a lot of people in 
America who think it is graceful to 
toe out and who, therefore, favor 
shoes built on that plan. Some 
street ear conductors and policemen 
are afflicted with the same painful 
delusion. 

The prevention of ingrowing nail {s 
the simplest thing in the world. Wear 
shoes built to fit feet. The cure of 
ingrowing nail is another bealth talk. 


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. 
. Aspirin Entects. 

A lady takes 10 grains of aspirin 
about every two hours to prevent 
headache and neuritis. She seems to 
have a weak heart. She says a doetor 
told her 10 grains is a better balanced 


has been taking it steadily now for 
over feur months, and she says she is 
miserable without it .., (M. H. 8.) 

Answe e won't bea lady long if 
she doesn’t break the habit. She'll 
be nothing bot remains. “The drug. 
acetyl-saljeylic acid, does kill pain and 
drown sorrow and all that, but it is a 
heart depressing, blood destroying 
chemical, and habitual use of such a 
poison is — to bring sad results.

TODAY'S TALK 


BY GEORGE MATTHEW ADAMS 


i] (Copyright, 1921, for The Constitution) 


OUR HUNGRY SOULS. 

It is a strange fact that those who 
seem to ly most in material posses- 
sions, are the hungriest in soul. 

Jesus—that great Physician to the 
soul—seemed to understand this ag 
few have. One day a very wealthy 
man came to Him to talk things over. 
The man had become much interested 
in this Teacher who had attracted 
wide attention. This is what Jesus 
told him: “You will have to sell all 
you have before you will be in the 
right spiri¢ to become a partner . of 
mine in the work that I am doing.” 

On several occasions others came fo 
Him for advice as to what to do with 
their lives, and His reply was always 
to get rid of the things which made 
the spiritual life a secondary affair. 

When the womdn at the well told 
this Man about her life and how she 
came regularly to draw from that well, 
He told her that it was possible to 
have a well of water in her heart that 
would continually flow and quench bhér 
spiritual thirst forever. 

And that is what we all must learn 
very ¢arly—that what we ‘have. 
whether much or little, is merely 
loaned to ts for @ short time, and 
that the important task in life is to 
increase the health and wealth of our 
spiritual selves, | 

I always like Christmases and birth- 
days and anniversaries—beca@se they 
make you think of somebody else— 
and that’s the greatest way to feed 
your soul. 

Two bungry men, talking over their 
condition between themselves, get no- 
where. But it is possible for two hun- 
gry souls to talk together and each 
leave the ether’s presence filled to 
overflowing. For the soul Jongs and 
yearns for a place to go—and the 
simpler and humbler that place, the 
greater the feast. 

In the same manner 2s bread is the 
“staff of life” to the body, so is love 
the great food of the soul. 

So if you would be filled in soul— 
love much. not to question 
worth too far—just love and love and 
love. It will all come back!

‘ tution.)

Development of juvenile court sys- 
tems and control of child placements 
will be important topics discussed at 
the second day’s session of the confa- 


ence of representatives of public wel- 
fare departments of five southern 
states held at the Winecoff hotel. The 
first conference came to an end Wed-* 
nesday night after resolutions had 
been adopted endorsing the organiza- 
tion of state councils of social agencies 
in all southern states and pledging the 
co-operation of the five state welfare 
departments in such _ organization 
work. 

Burr Blackbirn, secretary of the 
Georgia state board of public wel- 
fare, who invited the other represerta- 
tives to Atlanta, announced Wednes- 
day night that the Thursday session 
will be devoted largely to a discussion 
of the following subjects: . 

Subjects for Today. 

Mental hygiene, development of 
juvenile courts, control of child place- 
ments and enforcement of child labor | 
laws. 

At the Wednesday session the wel- 
fare -workers recommended that a nz- 
tional! foundation fund be established 
which would have an income sufficient 
to furnish a secretary to at least one 
southern state council of social agen- 
cies. ~ 

Some of the most prominent welfare | 
workers in five states are attending 
the conference. Important topics ‘of 


lating to the future of this class of 
work were discussed at the Wednes- | 
day meetings.

\File Petition 


For Clemency 


Moultrie, Ga., January 4.— (Spe- 
cial.)—Bill Radney and John T. Mc- 
Cracken, serving -life sentences for 
murder in connection with the killing 

’ Henry T. Jones, a prominent saw- 
mill man, in 1917, have filed a peti- 
tion for clemency with ¢he prison 
commission. ‘The plea, supperted by 
letters from several of .-e trial jurors, 
who declared “we hated to find the de- 
fendants guilty of murder or acquit 
them.” 

Jones was killed under unusual cir- 
cumstances. His slcyers insisted that 
at the time they were members of a 
sheriff's posse trying to arrest a ne- 
gro wanted for a felony; Jones was 
shot while crossing a bridge, which 
Radney and McCracken were guard- 
ing. They declared that in the dark- 
ness they thonght Jones wag the ne- 
gro and called upon him to stop. He 
immediately began shooting, the = ac- 
cused men said at their trials. 

Jones’ version of the killing, as 
given in his dying statement, how- 
ever, was different. He said that the 
demand to balt was accompanied py 
a fusillade of shots and that he was 
mortaliy wounded before he could 
draw his own gun. The state insisted 
that even if Jones did shoot first, he 
had a right to do so on the reasonable 
assumption that he was being stopped 
by highwaymen. 

At the first trial th@ jury, after 
being out nearly three days, returned 
a verdict finding Radney and Mce- 
Cracken guilty of voluntary man- 
slaughter, They were sentenced to 
10 years each in the penitentiary. The 
verdict was set aside on the conren- 


% gram at night telling of a death in} tion of attorneys for the defendants

J. C. MURNAN HERE AS

nun is now the manager of the Flor- 
sheim Shoe company’s store at 17 
Peaciitree street, succeeding A. L. 
Ray, who has resigned to enter the 
shoe business for himself. 

Mr. Murnan is originally from In- 
dianapolis, where he was connected

Florshim store in Savannah for a 
year, and following this spent six

BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Bureau, 
Raleigh Hotel. 


Washington, January 4.—(By Con- 
stitution Lea Wire. )—Denounc- 
ing the so-called packcr consent decree 
as a “clog in the wheels of industrial 
progress and an interference with the 
natural functioning of business,” Sena- 
tor Stanfield, of Oregon, today said he 
hoped the attorney-general, without 
unnecessary delay, would petition the 
courts to annul, or, at least, modify it. 

Senator Stanfield said a number of 
important industries had been wiped 
out or were so enfeebled as to be use- 
less because of the operation of the de- 
cree. He said he could not understand 


why farmers in any number would give}. 


support to a measure which necessarily 
injures them because, as he charges, it 
impairs the available means for the 
distribution of their preducts. 

“I have been stigmatized as a friend 
of the packers,” said Senator Stan- 
field. “So I am. I am the friend of 
the packers when they are right; their

/enemy when they are wrong. If big 
‘business does wrong, there is ample 
‘law to deal with it: if it does right. 
every encouragement should be given 
it by the people of the United States. 

“The evil that a deeree of the char: 
acter mentioned can do is illustrated 
by what has already occurred in my 
state. It has literally wiped out can- 
ning and other concerns which were en- 
gaged in a business that was valuable 
to the farmers and the consumers alike. 
By taking away from he packers the 
right to make use of their machinery, 
for the distribution of. sq-called unre 
lated lines, wholesome business on the 
Pacifie coast has inf a number of cases 


‘been prostrated. 
Do 


n’t Punish Farmers. 

“Of course, regulate the packers if 
they are wrong, but don’t punish the 
farmers and the consumers by paralyz- 
ing their efforts to serve the public. 
The decree is absurd and grotesque. 
but it is worse: it stays the march of 
business progress. In a country like 
ours, we ought. above all things, to be 
progressive. 4 We ought to utilize, to 
the fullest possible extent, all the ma- 
ehinery we have.” 

Continuing, he said: 

“The plea of the wholesale grocers 
that they will suffer pecuniary loss if 
the consent decree is modified, cannot 
be recognized. It is in no sense valid. 
If they are unable or unwilling to so 
equip thmeselves-as to be able success- 
fully to complete with the packers, that 
is not the concern of th® government. 

“The only concern of the government 
is to see that business of any kind is 
not crippled by laws and decrees which 
manifestly are unjust. Co-operative 
farm organizations and others want to 
get their product to the consumers 
with all possible speed, at the lowest 
possible cost. If the wholesale grocers 
are able to perform this service in an 
efficient manner, let them doit. But to 
exclude others from the right to engage 
in this kind of activity is a proceed- 
ing that reason will not support. 

“As I have already said. this decree 
has ruined hitherto thriving concerns 
in my state. If allowed to stand, there 
is no telling how muck injury will re- 
sult from it. e consumers in the 
cities are just as vitally eoncerned as 
the organizations and indiv**uals who 
can their fruit, vegetables and other 
food supplies. It is hardly to be ex- 
nected that our government can, with 
these facts in mind, give any consider- 
ation to the plea that the modification 
of the consent decree is going to drive 
some wholesale grocers out ot business. 

Must Drop Out. 

“Tf the wholesale grocers are unable 
to hold their place in the industria! 
procession. they will just have to drop 
out and allow something or somebody 
else to step in.” { 

Senator Stanfield said he was sure 
when the farmers, through their organ- 
izations, demanded so long and so ur- 
rently that the packers be regulated. 


to be astured that the big five would 
not be guilty of acts which work an 
injury to agriculture. 

“But itis absurd to believe that any 
farmer would think that the scrapping 
of packer equipment would add any- 
thing to the resources of agriculture 
or afford any protection to men en- 
gaged in producing and selling the food 
of the nation,” said Senator Stanfield.

On the eve of his return to resume 
his duties in congress, Congressman 
W. D. Upshaw highly commended the 
nativity play presented at thé Audi- 
ee as a municipal Christmas 


pagean 

“Before 1 return to Washington I 
feel constrained to offer my enthusi- 
astic congratulations to the people of 
my home city on the wonderful wealth 
of sacred inspiratidns that came to 
the thronging thousands who wit- 
inessed the nativity play at the Audi- 
torium Sunday afternoon. 

“It is eause for further congratuia- 
tion that this marvelous presentation 
of Bible truth and sacred history has 
been repeatedly witnessed in Atlanta, 
but it so occurs that in my driving, 
busy life I havé, never had opportunity 
to see it before. And now 1 realize 
the mental and spiritual poverty of 
every man, woman and child who has 
never sat under the spell of this inde- 
seribable Atlanta production. 

“I ceuld but remark to Mrs. B. M. 
Boykin, president of Atlanta Woman's 
club, ‘that evermore | must look back 
upon that mountain-peak experience 
on New Year’s Day as a unit of com- 
putation and commiseration for every 
man and woman I meet who has ney- 
er felt the impact of that enriching 
and inspiring experience.’ 

‘To Mrs. Dora Hood Johnson, the 
remarkable gifted Atlanta woman who 
gave this play to the world, Atianta 
owes a monument of appreciation and 
a debt of gratitude that can never be 
paid. And a proportionate debt is 
due the brilliant cast of Atlantans 
who supported the author with such 
rare histrionic talent. “lt seems al- 
‘most a pity that every Sunday is not 
a Christmas of New Year Day, for 
the recurrence of its presentation will 
cause every time an unspeakable uplift 
that will make a better and a happier

Washington, January 4.—Georgia's 
suit against the state of South Caro- 
lina, brought under an act of the 
Georgia legislature passed in 1917, 
involving the boundary dispute be- 
tween the two states, which has pre- 


in the supreme court today. The 
final location of the boundary line be- 
tween the two states is declared of 
utmost importance in view of the 
twenty-one hydro-power sites on the 
three rivers, Savannah, Togaloo and 
Chattahoochee, which forms the 
boundary. 

Georgia claims that the boundary is 
the middle of the three rivers where 
there is no island, that the islands 
have been conceded to it by South 
Carolina and that where there is an 
island in any of the three rivers the 
boundary line is midway between them 
and the South Carolina shore. 

South Carolina claims’ that the 
boundary in the rivers, where there 
is no island, is the low-water mark 
on the Georgia side. and that where 
there is an island, that the line is low- 
water und k on the north shore of the 


MORE BLOOD CLOTS 
FOUND IN MYSTERY 


Macon, Ga., January 4.—(Spe- 
cial.)—The finding of two pools of 
blood on the main highway between 
Camp Wheeler and Macon today add- 
ed renewed zest to the search tor 
the body of A. P. Sexton, missing 
Royston planter, who is thought to 
have been murdered several days ago 
and his body thrown in a swamp near 
Macon. 

Specimens of the blood are being 
examined at the Macon hospital to de- 
termine whether or not it is from the 
body of a-human being and in the 
meantime the territory for several 
miles around the place where the clots 
were found is being combed by sev- 
eral searching parties. 

Sexton’s relatives are convinced he 
was murdered, and today a Pinkerton 
detective arrived here to aid in solving 
the mystery. 

Both city and county sleuths are 
aiding in the search, and several other 
parties are continuing the _ search 
along the highway between Macon 
and Royston. 


RAIL REVENUES 
TO BE REDUCED .- 
ABOUT $80,000,000 


New York, January 4.—Freight 
rate reductions on tarm_ products, 
made voluntarily by the railroads and 
ordered by the. interstate commerce 
commission will cut down railroad 
revenues throughout the country by 
gpproximately $80,000,000, it is esti- 
mated here. The commission’s order , 
calling for a decrease of freight rates 
on hay, grain, grain products and al- 
jalfa for trans-Mississippi territory 
will go into effect on Saturday and 
will add 61-2 per cent to the 10 per 
cent voluntary reduction of rates on 
various classes of farm products made 
effective January 1 by all railroads 
except those of New England. 

4 Arrangements have been made by 
“he commission to resume next Wed- 
nesday the inquiry upon which will be 
based that-body’s action in directing 
further rate decreases. One week will 
be devoted to Hstening to evidence sub- 
mitted by the carriers, while shippers 
of coal, coke, building materials, lum- 
ber and forest products will give tes- 
timony from January 19 to January 
30. The hearings will continue into 
February, when tariffs on grain, flour, 
live stock, packing house products, 
fruits, vegetables, canned goods and 
dairy products will be under scrutiny. 

The investigation will not be con- 
cluded much before March 1, and if is 
probable the commission will not be 
able to-reach any decision before 
April 1.

Frankfort, Ky., January 4—A

row Wilson, read in the lower house 
of the Kentucky general assembly to- 
day, said that “each of my birthdays

Governor Denies 
Starvation Reports. 
From Mine Fields 


Charleston, W. Va., January 4.— 
Governor Morgan, answering a request 
of United States Senator Howard Su- 
therland for information “concern- 
ing reports that men, women and 
children in certain West Virginia min- 
ing communities were destitute and in 
a starving condition” today denied 
that the reports were true. 

“Frankly, let me say that these re- 


ports,” wrote Governor Morgan to 
Senator Sutherland, “in so far as I 


have been able to determine from in-}: 


vestigations which I caused to be in- 
itiated, are grossly exaggerated and 
are seemingly the product of imagina- 
tive minds of interested propagandists 
who are desirious of distorting condi- 
tions that exist in minor communities 
as a result of depression in coal in- 
dustry, and difficulties arising from 
the maintenance of contract between 
employers and employees.” 

“It is true,” continued Governor 
Morkah, “that scattering cases of pov- 
erty have been discovered, but the wel- 
fare agencies find these cases even in 
times of general prosperity. And it is 
equally true that there has been no 
suffering in this state during the pres- 
ent depression which the local authori- 
ties or local welfare agencies have 
been unable to alleviate.” 

Governor Morgan detailed investi- 
gations by George F.. Daugherty, state 
abor commissioner in Fayette and 
Raleigh -counties which, he said, dis- 
closed that the “reports of distressing 
conditions were not of a serious na- 
ture and that the county authorities 
and Red Cross were prepared to give 
aid in any case of distres&S or suffer- 


A Raléigh county committee was 
quoted by the governor as reporting 
to him that “in no instance did we 
find a family starving and in every 
case we found they had food enough 
to last for several days. To be sure, 
Christmas was not perhaps as bright 
as it might have been had the men 
been working, but there was no dire 
necessity anywhere.” 

The committee distributed candies 
and other things for Christmas among 
fifty-seven families with a total of 281 
individugls, the report added. 


SPROUL WILL NOT 
SUGCEED PENROSE 


Phifadelphia, January ¢ 4.—Gover- 
nor William C. .Sproul will remain 
the chief executive of the state -of 
Pennsylvania and decline the oppor- 
tunity to go to the United States sen- 
ate as successor to the late Senator 
Boies Penrose. he announced Offi- 
cialv here Wednesday night. 

The governor’s decision to refuse 
the appointment which would have 
been made by the lieutenant gover- 
nor following his resignation, was 


tray the trusteeship given him by 
the people.” 

Sproul stated that he would not 
“desert the office of governor, the 
highest gift of the people of the cém- 
monwealth, nor use it to further my 
own ambitions.” 

He said that during his campaign 
and at his inauguration he expressed 
a feefing of profound respect for the 
office and that feeling - has been 
strengthened as his term has gone 
on. 

In his statement, however, he inti- 
mated that he would probably run 
for United States senaror next elec 
tion.

NINE PER CENT 


IN TREASURY BILL 


Washington, January 4.—VDespite 
informal requests from the adminis- 
tration urging close following by 
congress of the estimates submitted 
by the new budget bureau, the treas- 
ury department appropriation bill re- 
ported today by the house appropria- 
tions committee disclosed a cut of ap- 
proximately Y per cent.. The measure 
is the first of the regular supply bills 
to be completed by the committee un- 
der the new system provided by the 
budget act 

The bill as reported carries a total 
of $118,610,959 for expenses of the 
treasury during the fiscal year be- 
ginning next July 1. This is $12,606,- 
827.38 less than the amount requested 
in the budget and $17,770,591 less 
than the total for the current fiscal 
year. ‘The measure probably will be 
taken up on the floor tomorrow.. 

For enforcement of prohibition, $9.- 
250,000 is recommended—S$750U,000 
less than was requested, but $1,750,- 
| 000 more than was available this 
| year. Prohibition Commissioner 
Haynes told the committee while the 
prohibition unit had 1,139 field 
agents and clerks an additional force 
of 750 fieid agents and 153 field 
elerks was needed. The appropriation, 
Chairman Madden said, would provide 
for approximately 75 iess additional 
persons than number requested. 

The committee eliminated all re- 
quests for salary increases and re- 
duced the estimates under public 
buildings approximately $2,800,000. 
Among the items eliminated was 
$500,000 for purchase of a site in 
Washington for a national archives 
building, $1,000,000 toward cornstruc- 
tion of a vault for the _ treasury, 
$735,000 for repairs to public health 
service hospitals caring for war vet- 
erans, which will be supplied, Mr. 
Madden said, under appropriations for 
the veterans bure a uand $73,000 for 
the Boston immigration station. 


ROBERTSON QUITS 
CHAMBER PLACE 


(Continued From Page One.) 


a 


wholesale industrial movement similar 
to that carried out in Baltimore, Md. 
The other was that the chamber 
should use local men and a local staff 
in furthering the work of the organ- 
ization. 

Upon the policy of the chamber, 
said Mr. Foote, the personnel will 
depend, in answer to a query as to 
whether any changes in the staff 
eould be recommended by the commit- 
tee. 

The president and three vice presi- 
dents of. the chamber compose the ex- 
ecutive committee. They are Mr. 
Foote, Robert K. Rambo, Robert C, 
Alston and Paul H. Norcross. 

In the annual report of Charles E. 
Robertson, secretary of the chamber, 
made public Wednesday, a compari- 
son was drawn between the growth of 
Atlanta and other cities during the 
period of business depression, and it 
was shown that Atlanta had con- 
tinued to expand while other cities 
had remained at a standstill. 

Under the head of ‘‘new business,’ 
the report says: 

Not a Good Year. 

“Nineteen hundred twenty-one has 
not been a good year for business ex- 
pansion, and as a natural consequence 
we can-not claim any. particular ad- 
ditions to our industrial population. 
In spite of conditions, however, we 
have brought to Atlanta a large num- 
ber of branch offices of foreign cor- 
porations. Although two new office 
buildings—the Palmer and the Metro- 
politan—have been added, and many 
offices have been vacated by doctors, 
there is at present only 2 per cent 


which fact speaks for itself. —...... 

“Atlanta ae pecul 
nate during. : 
no industrial mt of tre- 
mendous size, consequently — our 
unemployment problem has not been 
so serious. Our more than 500 
small and medium-sized factories have 
been more or less affected, bunt not to 
anything like the extent of the larger 
imdustries of other cities of similar 
size. 

“The chamber of commerce has been 
severely criticised for its inactivity 
along the line of industrial expan- 
sion. In this connection itvis signifi- 
cant to note that of all @ities of its 
class Atlanta alone has continued ‘its 
growth during the business depres- 
sion. It has fewer unemployed, iess 
distress and fewer homes and stores 
vacant. 

Follow Economic Lines. 

‘Industrial expansion must necessa- 
rily follow economic lines. It is no 
longer attracted by ready-made propa- 
ganda, nor does the progressive city 
offer such inducement as free sites, 
water, taxes, etc.

had many opportunities to secure new

Ninety per cent of them call on 
tim to throw a monkey wrench into 
Mrs. Zander’s machinations. They 
come from every section of the country 
ir such quantities that the Chicago 
postoffice is actually being badly over- 
worked. Mr. Smith's mail for one 
day this week amounted to more than 
3,000 letters, and all the communica-

A goodly proportion of these letters 
came from Georgia and neighboring 
states, showing that the south is as 
deeply interested in this all-consamiag 
question as any other section of the 
country. 

Neo Solace From Creator. 

Mr. Smith, the creator of the 
Gumps, however, has refused to give 
solace to his anixous enquirers. He

what will happen to an aging man 
who has fallen in love. 

“And still further,-there’s no telling 
what will happen to anybody who has 
a widow on his trail.” 

It looks like the Gumps and their 
thousands of friends) are sailing 
through a stormy sea. 

But then again, Sid Smith is a kind- 
hearted fellow. 


It may all turn out right, just like | 


a fairy story.

complaints of lax enforcement of the 
Volstead act and frequent shifts in 
federal prohibition headquarters. 

When Federal Judge Knox this af- 
ternoon ordered the seals broken, it 
was found that the defendarfts had 
been charged with defrauding the gov- 
ernment by issuing false and fraudu- 
lent withdrawal permits, whereby 
liquor exceding vastly the amounts al- 
lowed any one defendant for the com- 
pounding of drugs had _ been with- 
drawn. The offense, alleged to have 
involved wholesale quantities of liquor, 
ranks with a felony and, upon convic- 
tion, the defendants would face three- 
year prison terms,

The indictment contains but one 
count, with overt acts cited in support 
of the charges. The method alleged to 
have been employed parallels’ that 
charged against post office clerks: re- 
cently asserted to have issued fraudu- 
lent money orders far in advance of 
the current number which legally 
could be issued. As in the case of 
money orders, the withdrawal permits 
are made out in blank and numbered 
serially.

married life is the happiest... 


| measures, and each tries to apply to 


the other his »wn standarc of meas- 
urement with inevitable misunder- 
standings. 

A woman who has been married 2U 
years and is unusually happy with her 
husband told me that she could never 
see a young couple in their first year 
of married life without wishing she 
could tell the wife some of the big 
and little things she has learned about 
men and wherein they are different 
from women. 

Wherein They Differ. __ 

Here are some of the masculine in- 
-\e preane which she has discov- 
ered: | 

“Men are apt to feel at their best 
at night and grouchy in the morning, 
especially before they have gotten 
their coffee into thei. 

“Men concentrate more than wom- 
en. That is why they hate to be 
spoken to when they are reading. 
Woman’s work is of such a nature that 
she is accustomed to thinking of 
half a dozen things at once (as soon as 
the baby finishes his bottie 1 must 
call up and order the dinner’), and 
never gets the habit of concentration 
as must successful men have it. 
“Men hate to ask directions of any 
sort. Don’t know just what this has 
its root in, but it is true of nine men 
out of ten. 

‘“‘Men hate things to be very hot. 
They can not stand as hot a bath or 
as hot food as women. 

‘“‘Men do not like supersensitiveness. 
Hurt feelings, especially if ostenta- 
tiously displayed, enrage them instead 
of appealing to them. 

Men Hate Tears. 

“Likewise men dislike tears. ‘hey 
seldom weep themselves, when they 
do they pass through a painful and 
devastating cataclysm instead of find- 
ing emotional relief. Consequently 
they do not understand women’s cry- 
ing and try to prevcent it by a dis- 
couraging manner. Women often 
think this manner applies to the sub- 
ject over which they are weeping rath- 
er than to the tears themselves, and 
further complications result.” 
Of course there are men who have 
feminine attributes and there are wom- 
en who have masculine attributes. 
That fact modifies these findings some- 
what. But these habits of mind which 
this woman has sketched are mascu- 
line, and the average male possesses 
some if not. all of them.

Music Club Hears 
Lecture Recital 


On Modern Sonata 


The Atlanta Music club was pro- 

vided a special program yesterday, 
which combined, in admirable fashion, 
cultural value ‘and entertainment. 
i Dean H. H. Bellamon, of Chicora 
College, S. C., assisted by Miss Mari- 
on Purcell at the piano, gave a lecture 
recital on “The Sonata,” a _ subject 
which did not prove dry under his 
treatment. He had a personality to 
hold the absorbed attention of his 
hearers, the convictions to drive his 
information home, and the illuminat- 
ing element of humor. 

He compared the old sonata form 
with the modern, which has become 
usually a larger and connected con- 
cert composition, and he dwelt at spe- 
cial length on the sonata of Charles 
Ives, which is called “Concord, Mass. 
—15840-60,” and in which he brought 
out the delightful personal  eccen- 
tricities of -the composer as well as 
the good points of his work. 

An ae statement by Dean 
Bellamon was that Busoni, celebrated 
Italian pianist and composer, consid- 
ered Walter Stokoff, of St. Louis, the 
greatest modern American composer, 
and that much of Europe hold the 
same opinion, while America does not 
know he exists. Even the American 
publishers could give Dean Bellamon 
no information about his works. 

Miss Purcell is a pianist of attain- 
ment, and provided a most pleasing 
een to Dean Bellamon’s lec- 
ure. 

The next event in the Study elub’s 
program will be a special concert Sat- 
urday afternoon at Egleston hall by a 
group of artists, headed by Miss 
Knowlton, of Kollin’s college, in 
Florida, who are en route home from 
concerts in New York and at Pea- 
body conservatory in Baltimore, 
where they presented the same pro- 
gram—compositions of Susan Dyer, 
— will form the Atlanta selec- 
ion.

Weight of Woman’s Vote 
As Analyzed by Expert 


BY LOUISE DOOLY 


“The ‘Four Ladies of the Apoca- 
lypse’—that is what I call the four 
women members of the advisory board, 


‘U. 8. delegation to the arms parley, 
b:cause they are such a revelation to 
men.” 

The clever utterance was that of 


Mrs. Meredith Ellis, of ‘Washington; 


D. C., in Atlanta for a few hours en 
rocte to California, and the guest 
while heré of Mrs. John K, Ottley. 

“These woméen are so utterly dif- 
ferent from what the men on the board 
expected them to be,” she continued, 
“that it is a continuoys marvel. 

“No less are they an enigma to the 
newspaper reporters. Women who 
won’t talk. The idea is preposterous. 
Yet every method of interview has 
been attempted without avail. 

“Reporters have even tried to goad 
them into making statements or ex- 
pressing opinion on the work of the 
conference by telling them that the 
women of the country are pushing 
them for statementa. ‘Your sister 
women, hearing no expression from 
you, are beginning to think,’ the more 
persistent of the newspaper men have 
told the silent four, ‘that you have 
no real voice in the parley; that your 
advice, your opinions on the board, 
are ignored.’ 

“And then a polite retort is made: 
‘Are the men on the advisory board 
making any statements? Have you 
succeeded in making them talk?’ 

Women to Be Proud Of. 

“These four women,” continued Mrs. 
Ellis, “are « group that the women 
of America may well be proud of. They 
come from the far west, the middle 
west, New England, and then one, 
through her years of experience in 


the Far East, has had first-hand study | 


and knowlcdge of Pacific problems: 
Mrs. Thomas G. Winter, of Minneso- 
ta; Mrs. Katherine Philips Edson, 
of California; Mrs. Eleanor Frank- 
lin Egan, of New York, writer on 
Asiatic subjects, and Mrs. Charles 
Sumner Bird, of New England. They 
were selected, too, without regard for 
political party. 

“Sought on all sides, of coursé, as 
public speakers, all hut Mrs. Bird are 
responding, and they are making great 
impressions,” 

Mrs. Meredith is herself a woman 
of national leadership, conspicuous by 
her deeds, rather than by her ‘per- 
so. ality; for in appearance and man- 
ner she js rather one’s ideal of the 
old-fashioned, the ultra-feminine type, 
this heightened by her low voice and 
almost timid manner, and her cheeks 
becomingly turning pink when some 
of the honors which have come to her 
are put forward. . 

She was a pioneer in the successful 
promotion of the suffrage movement, 
and took active part in the campaign 
in Colorado in 1893 when women of 
that state were given the vote. 

“Tt was the panic year,” she said, 
“and I remember one man said to me, 
‘We haven’t.got anything else to give 
you women this year except the vote, 
so I guess we will have to give you 
that.’ 

“Tt is no unmitigated joy to be a 
pioneer in anything, however. After 
we women’ in Colorado got the vote 
we had to go through the teething and 
measles stage, which included misrep- 
resentation, as well as accusations, 
even from. the women of the other 
states, which had not yet the suf- 
frage, that we were not living up to 
our guarantees; we were not pushing 
as we should the legislation the 
women should have. ; 

“One thing we have accomplished 
which we value highly; and that is 
that the men of Colorado, where* the 
women have been in public life. for 
thirty years, look us in the eye: and 
take us seriously, instead of bowing us 
out politely, but without substantial 
co-operation. 

An Open Mind. 
“We have learned things and we

instance, we have a very good child 
labor law in Colorado as far as it goes, 
but it does not provide for the child in 
the country, and we see a great need 
for a change, on account of the large 
number of foreigners in the wheat 
fields, where the man at the head of 
the family sits up and smokes and eats 
and makes his wife and children earn 
the family living. In two legislatures 
we have tried to have our law amend- 
ed, and we lost out. This time we are 
initiating a bill of our own, and we éex- 
pect to get it through. 

“Probably the biggest thing the 
women of Colorado have to their 
credit is the initiative and the referen- 
dum. It is conceded that the women 
put that through, and we know we 
have a medium in it by which the 
people can directly express them- 
selves.”’ 

Mrs. Meredith was for five years 
head of the election commission in 
Denver, and. her election to it is an 
interesting story in itself, hinging on 
the reluctance of the women when 
first given the vote to put themselves 
forward for office, the too complacent 
acceptance by the men of their self- 
effacement, and then the women’s 
choice of Mrs. Meredith as the wom- 
an best suited as an entering wedge; 
the heated campaign, and Mrs. Mere- 
dith’s winning out at the head of the 
ticket. She was expected to be in 
office only during one administration,

which would involve only one election. 
Instead of that there was a change of 
political conditions, which kept her in 
office five years and included thirteen 
elections. 

M Meredith is a charter and life 
member of the Woman’s club of Den- 
ver, a charter mémber of the Woman's 
Civic club of Washington, gnd a mem- 
ber of the District of Columbia League 
of Women _ Voters. 

The W t of Women’s Vote. 

Since Mrs. Meredith is conceded to 
be one of the best posted women in 
the country on political science, her 
views must be regarded as particular- 
ly weighty on a subject like that of 
the ultimate meaning of the women’s 
vote. 


“What is your answer to the fre- 
quent accusation that the women will 
divide into the poltical parties accord- 
ing to the way their husbands vote, 
thus producing a balance which will 
leave matters as they were before the 
women were given the franchise?’ 

“One answer,” she said, “is the plain 
fact that the women, while they ally 
themselves with parties already estab- 
lished, which is as it should be, will 
scratch their ballots. 

“This very fact was the basis of 
one of our best political reforms in 
Colorado. Politicians admid there that 


-every ballot since women have voted is 


a scratched ballot. A woman. will 
adhereto the principles of her party, 
but she will scratch the candidate from 
her own party who has not lived up to 
his promises, and vote for a man of 
the opposite party who will. 

““*You didn’t vote for this man, and 
yet you promised his party your sup- 
port,’ a man will reproach the Colo- 
rado woman. 

“Yes, but he didn’t do what he 
promised to do,’ the woman will retort. 
They keep tab on his record. They are 
not satisfied with his premises. 

“And thus the numbered or party 
ballot became a useless thing. ‘G. O. 
P.’ at the top of it meant notihng 
to a woman, if the men named on it 
did not stand for the things she want- 
ed, and so they were finally done away 
with. 

“And right here, let me point out a 
splendid opportunity which faces you of 
the south. 

To Women Voters. 


“T seq that your State League of 
Women Voters is holding its conven- 
tion this week in Savannah, and I can 
think of no message that would be 
more vital to them than this: 

“If the democratic party would again 
take up the reins—if it would gird 
itself successfully for a return to dom- 
inance, then the women must preside 
at the renascence. You are expected 
to. You are fresh on the field. You 
have no political axes to grind. You 
are provided with ideals. You can 
build on a foundation of principles, 
rather than persons. 

‘Two political parties are an excel- 
lent thing, butisit nota pity that both 
do not take principles more seriously, 
and make principles, than persons, the 
great issue? 

“Let the women of the south take 
that as their motive in their first 
steps in citizenship. They céuld thus 
be the leaders in a most constructive 
patriotism.” 

Woman’s News Service. 

Another interest of Mrs. Meredith’s 
which is of great concern to the women 
of the country is the Women’s News 
Service, Inc., which was inspired by 
Ida Clyde Clarke, now its editor, and 
first sponsored by the General Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs. Mrs. Mere- 
dith is convinced of the great future of 
this organ of woman’s opinion, and ex- 

ts that its financial foundation will 

e so assured by spring that it will 
then be in actual operation. It now has 
involved in the launching of the move- 
ment, said Mrs. Ellis, some of the most 
substantial women in the country, both 
on its executive and edtorial sides.

OWNERS OF AUTOS 
WARNED TO CARE 


FOR THEIR TAGS 


Automobile owners. who buy license 
tags for 1922, are advised to see that 
these tags are securely attached to 
their cars, as they will face consider- 
able inconvenience in obtaining dupli- 
cate tags this year, in a statement 
issued Wednesday by Charles O. Cook. 
cashier of the motor vehicle depart- 
ment in the office of Secretary of 
State S. G. McLendon. 

Mr. Cook said last year more than 


2,000 duplicate tags were issued. The ‘ 


automobile owners are advised partic- 
ularly to inspect their cars when they 
take them out of the garage. to see if 
the tags still are attached. Last year 
many of the tags were lost in garages, 
according to claims made by owners in 
seeking duplicate tags. 

This year it will require thirty or 
forty days for the state department 
to obtain duplicate tags as they will 
be ordered from the factory. To ob- 
tain a duplicate the owner will be re- 
quired to furnish an affidavit that 
the tag was lost and also produce 
proper records to show the original 
purchase of the tag. 


Shrine Minstrels 
Start Rehearsing 
At Temple Tonight 


At the request of Potentate Bayne

ing Wednesday night Mr. Somers will 
pick from the assembled talent nobles 
who can sing, dance and tell stories 
to make up the chorus, give volume to 
the glee club and take minor parts 
in the comedy skits. 

With the exception of a few whose 
talents are well known, no special in- 
vitations to participate have been ex- 
tended, so it is up ‘o any noble who 
can add to the enjoyment of the oc- 
casion to volunteer his services. 


FINE BUSINESS DONE 
BY EQUITABLE LIFE 


Members of the local force of the 
Equitable Life Assurance society met 
and discussed the work of the old year 
and made plans for the new year at a 
luncheon Wednesday afternoon in the 
Ansley hotel, Norman E. Ellsworth, 
district manager, presiding. 

The Georgia agency of the Equita- 
ble, through its Atlanta headquarters, 
it was pointed out, wrote $2,500,000 
insurance in 1921 In excess of that 
written in 1920, which was a peak 
year; paidfora million in excess of 
that written in 1920, and carried over 
for settlement in Janaury and Februa- 
ry, 1922, an additional million. ; 

This great record, according to Wil- 
liam E. Duncanson, agency manager, 
was the result of optimism, intensive 
training and systematic hard work of 
its representatives Cesepnent Georgia. 

The program for 1922 calls for an 

$2,000,000 in 1922 over 


increase 0

Eecentriec and Colerful Are 

Reinstated In Gowns in the New 

Things Fashioned for the Mid- 

season Which Are Forerunners. of 

What. Will Be Shown to. the Buy- 
ers in February. 


Those in the dress business begin 
to grow a trifle uneasy when the 
month of February approaches. It is 
then the French open the doors to the 
American buyers and exploit the new 
lines, fabrics and trimmings. The pub- 
lie is rarely worried at this season. 
It says that the burden rests upon 
those who make clothes, not upon 
it, and American woman is only in- 
frequently interested in a fashion un- 
til it appears in the shops in sufficient 
force to convince her that things have 
changed, 

The American buyer can well say 
what a theatrical producer said to 
the public after the first night of a 
new play: “What to you is only a 
pleasant evening is to me a venture 
of $50,000." None outside the busi- 
ness realize the millions of dollars 
risked on the buying of a new fashion 
in February openings in France, the 
tremendous courage it takes to exploit 
a new garment by the manufacturers 
over here, the anxiety caused by the 
discarding: of one line of fabric for 
another, with its resultant loss of 
stock and money. The public does nor 
sit by and calmly watch the ventures 
and the struggles. It does not even 
know that anything of interest’ is 
hanpening. 

Details from France mean much. 
however, if they appeal to a woman’s 
personal wroblems. Therefore, when 
. few of the new frocks show the re- 


Afternoon gown of black velvet with 
pointed sleeves of coral crepe

The girdle is also of the beads. 


vival of the ornamental sleeve which 
was in danger of eclipse after too 
much of it in early autumn, every 
woman turns her eyes with query and 
enthusiasm to the — speaker. a? 
they seem to say, “there’s a way to 
fix over my old crepe frock so I can 
wear it in the spring.” So it is. That 
is the reason the fact is imporfant, 


One of the smart new gowns in 


Paris is of black velvet with a long 
skirt with a diagonal line given by 
the overskirt, a _ trick which Callot, 
Chanel, and Molyneux exploit in new 
clothes. The girdle is Egyptian in 
character, as well it might be, for 
Egypt was the land of gorgeous gir- 
dies in its prime; this girdle is fash- 


ioned of steel beads wrought in flovwy. 
ers against a flat surface “and drop 
ping in two nants at the sides. 
Phe separate sleeves are of coral : 
gette, a color and fabric that seem. 
have made a deep impression on 
France. They are bell-shaped, t 
fall over the hands, and are layi 
embroidered with scallops of s 
beads to match the girdle. 

These separate sleeves should have 
a long life.. They solve the problem 
of how to dress for dinner at,7 when 
one does not know just what is a

A woman who had recently rec 
from France came into an afterrz 
reception, dressed in a mist gray 
gette frock without a touch of ¢ 
or trimming on it, The drapery

long. Some one asked her to sta 
dinner, then go on to the the

or the evening. Informality gage 
place to formality in five minutes, 
Paris has been indulging in this amug- 
ing trick since September and it is a 
wonder more Americans have not 
made the best of it 

What was done in a twinkling with 
that gtmy crepe’ gown can be done 
with this new black velvet one.. The 
coral sleeves can come out. They are 
merely snapped to the armholes. When 
they are removed, there is a fre 
that shows the arms and: neck qt 
bare. With one neutral-colored gow 
a woman can have enough. separgl 
sleeves to give variety to its appear- 
ance and its usage. It is the aper@f 
econfimy. One must not cloud the @x- 
periment, however, by choosing a gown 
that has ornamentation, such as 6ol- 
ored embroidery, or fanciful lining. 


Some of the sleeves can be traig- 
parent, others opaque. Fur sleeves 
are used on cold days with the im 
mense cuffs that serve as a_  moff. 
Another pair of sleeves, such as 
sweeping ones of georgette or ev@n 
metallic lace, puts the gown in fSe 
class for evening. It is an ancient 
fashion begotten in the epochs when 
gorgeous sleeves were the distinction 
of the frock, when no man was too 
proud to bedeck himself in such fine 
when jewels and precious peltry were 
considered important arm coverings.

THE MUSHROOM UNUSUAL. | 


Almost everybody considers mush- 
rooms delicacies. And there are so 
many ways of serving them that eyve& 
if you are tired of them in their more 
usual’ forms—though they are never 
better than when plain broiled @n 
toast—you may find them desirable in 
some other way. - 

Mushroom croquettes, for in- 
stance, are delicious. The mush- 
rooms are formed into a croquetge 
mixture with crumbs and white sauce, 
and are really worth trying. 

Another interesting way to cook 
them igs to dip the big ones _ into 
beaten egg and then bread crumbs, 
and then to fry them brown in deep, 
hot fat. | 

Scalloped Myshrooms—Cut the 
mushrooms if too large, after peel- 
ing them and trimming the aetalks. 
Throw them for a few minutes into 
boiling water, then drain and throw 
into cold water to whiten them, 
Dry well and saute in hot butter for 
three minutes. Then add, when al- 
most done, a teaspoon of flour apd 
some chopped parsley. Stir, ana in, 
thrée minutes add a cup of boiling 
broth. Let it simmer very gently 
for about ten minutes. Add lemon- 
juice, salt, and pepper. Remoge: 
from the fire and stir in the yolk @f 
an egg beaten up with a few drops of 
cold water or two teaspoons of sher- 
ry. Fill shells with this mixture; coy- 
er the top with bread crumbs; dot 
with butter; set in the oven until thgr- 
oughly hot, and serve. 

Broiled Mushrooms—Select the 
largest mushrooms that are to be had. 
Peel. Cut the stalk one-half an inch 
from the tops. Baste well with — * 


butted, sprinkle lightly with pepy 
and salt. Heat the broiler very—hot! 
lay the mushrooms upon it with the 
upper side down, close it carefully, 
that the mushrooms may not be brok- 
en, and broil them over a clear fite, 
turning the broiler first on one side, 
then on the other side.. As soon as 
tender, which will be in about five 
minutes, open the broiler, remove the 
mushrooms. carefully to trimmed a gl | 
well-buttered slices of toast, or thin 
bread fried in butter. Moisten with 
melted butter, and serve.

‘ormer Atlantan Making 
| : 
i: Success on Concert Stage 


A chiropodist once told me that the | 
feet are the most neglected and least 
understood part of one’s person. 
Women buy any shoes that are fash- | 
ionable at the moment and never con- 
sider the health or the comfort of 
the feet. Nor while they are wearing 
unhygienic shoes do they ever bother 
to give the feet the extra care need- 
ed to overcome the constant harm 
they are doing. 

Short-vamp shoes crowd the toes 
and make them curl under. If the 
shoes have high heels the weight of 
the body is thrown almost directly 
upon the toes while they are in this 
helpless position. Pointed toe shoes 
usually have a long-vamp, .crowd the 
toes together toward the tip of the 
shoe, so they are less able to take 
the weight of the foot. -They also 
throw out the joint of the big toe, 
—s a bunion inevitable later in 

ife. 

For many years we have been wear- 
ing pointed toe shoes and for many 


MISS ROSA POWELL. 


Miss Rosa Powell, of New York, 
formerly of Atlanta, is making a great 
“guccess on the concert stage. 
* Miss Powell sang recently in Rich- 
smond, as co-artist with Giovanni Mar- 
tinelli, of the Metropolitan Opera 
weompany, and in spite of the artistry 
sand popularity of this distinguished 
tenor, she shared honors with him in 
encores and recalls. 

Miss Vowell has a host of friends 
a. Atlanta since her residence here 


before the world war, when she was 
soloist of the Ponce de Leon Avenue 
Baptist church, and took an active 
part in the musical life, 

She left Atlanta to go with the 
Y. M. C. A, in their entertainment 
service with the A.‘E. F. in France. 
and on returning to America took up 
her residence in New York, where 
she has continued her study of voice 
with Salvator Fucito, Caruso’s coach 
and accompanist. 


Today's Short Story 


BY GEORGE T. BYE 
lilustrated by Arlene Coyle

The first night Walter Hoyt called 
fon Olive King, he said at 11 o'clock 
‘be was afraid he was keeping every- 
Endy up. 
. Dear me, no,” called Mrs. King 
from the next room, where she should 
not have been listening; “we stay up 
to all bours of the night in this family. 
gular night owls, aren’t we, Oli¥e, 
dear?” 
(As a matter of fact, Mr. King for 
an hour had been suppressing yawns 
with angry difficulty and had sig 
led and hissed to his wife that he 
d had enough of this foolishness and 
@ wasn’t going to sit up another 
minute to say good night to that kid.) 
: Second Night. 
Olive went upstairs to put on her 
t to accompany Walter to the cor- 


HOUSEHOLD LIES 


ner drug store for ice cream. 

“Hasn’t she a warm, sunny nature, 
the little darling?’ murmured Mrs. 
King to Walter. “Never an unkind 
word crosses her lips. I don’t know 


what I’d do if she would even frown.” 
(That day Mrs. King had cried for 
an hour because Olive called her an 


old fool.) 
Third Night. | 
Walter and Olive were going for a 


walk. 

‘Don’t tire her,”’ Mrs. King begged 
of Walter. ‘She is a delicate, fragile 
creature, bright as a cricket and just 
as dainty.” 

(To tell the truth, Mrs. King had 
scolded Olive that day for overeating 
and warned her she would be a fat, 
sloppy woman before she was 20, and 


years before that shoes wtih short- 
vamps, and as yet very few people 
have designed a shoe that combined 
common sense and good looks. As a 
result we have all been wearing harm- 
ful shoes and few of us have been 
exercising our feet to keep them in 
good health. 

Every day when you are in your 
bare feet, you should take the big toe 
of each foot and move it up and down, 


as well as side ways, so that the big 


| joint does ‘not stiffen or gtow large. 
Then all the toes should be moved up 
and down, so as to strengthen them.. 


| 


Then the whole foot should be 
srtetchéd out and relaxed and 
stretched out again and again, te ex- 
ercise the ankle, the Achilles tendon 
of the heel, and the bones of ‘the arch. 


Helen F.—The agar-agar wafers are 
just as effective as the agar-agar in 
flake form and probably easier to 
take. 

Thelma A.—You can discourage the 
growth of hair on the face by rubbing 
the skin occasionally with peroxide of 
hydrogen. 

Helen—I am glad that the pilocar- 
pine hair tonic has done your hair so 
much good. If you will keep up the 
treatment, it will make it grow and 
bring it in thicker. It takes a long 
time to improve the health of the 
hair and you must be patient. I do 
not think that adding bayrum or al- 
cohol to the tonic will dry the hair. 
If your scalp is quite oily, you can 
shampoo it every three weeks and 
even every two weeks, if it gets too 
oily. But I would suggest that you 
brush a little powdered orris through 
the hair when it gets oily and then 
brush it out thoroughly. ‘This will 
make it dry-and fluffy. 

A Reader—Send mé a letter with a 
self-addressed stamped envelope for 
the formula of my hair tonic.

Fourth Night. 

“She is such a sweet little inno- 
cent, and while I know you would not 
take any young woman to a question- 
able picture, still I would urge you 
in this case to make extra sure,”’ said 
Mrs. King while Walter waited for 
Olive who was putt®ng on her yarty

the movies when they show, the neigh-

“You would be a fool to try your 
_ snippishness on him.” 


(Only three hours earlier, Mrs. 
King, with flaming face, had shouted 
at Olive that she had found another 
one of those dirty gutter magazines in 
the girl’s room and that she would 
tell her father the very next time.) 

Fifth Night. 


Walter had not appeared at 38 
o'clock. 

Said Mrs. King: “I hope you 
haven’t made yourself unpleasant to 
that Hoyt boy. He comes from a good 
family and you would be a fool to try 
your snippishness on him?’ 

Answered Olive: “Is that so? Well, 
if he doesn’t come, I know the rea- 
son, He told me last night of all the 
silly cautioning you have been doing. 
That’s probably queered him, and I'll 
never forgive you if it has.”

MARYA: You're smiling now, like 
the sun peeping through the mists. 
Look in the glass and see for yourself. 
LADY: Would you like to sell it? 
MARYA: Oh, no. But maybe you 
could find one like it, if you try. 
LADY: I believe—I could. I must

Could you come out with me to point

ONE REEL YARNS 


THE SNOWMAN. 

“Why don’t you run out and play 
in the snow?” said Aunt Carolyn, as 
Nita sat listlessly by the window 
watching the pretty flakes swirl down. 

“I'd rather not, please,” said Nita 


quietly. That was her usual reply to 
any suggestion that she amuse her- 
self, ever since she had lost her 
mother and had come to &tay with 
Aunt Carolyn. 

“There’s little Jimmy Foster out in 
the yard,” persisted Aunt Carolyn. 
“He looks lonely. Why don’t you go 
help him make a snowman?” 

“I’m too big for snowmen,’ 
Nita, smiling a little. 

“Nonsense,” her aunt laughed, hur- 


? 


replied 


her. 
she had a chance to make much of 
a fuss, and beforé Nita knew what 
had happened she was out in front, 
shyly making plans. with the little 
boy next door. And in a short time 
she had forgotten she was beginning 
to grow up, as she and Jimmy rolled 
up huge balls of snow to make their 
wonderful snowman. The crisp air 
made her cheeks red. and she laughed 
as she had not done for many days. 
“Goodness,” said Nita an hour later, 
as she stood before the grate. “I’m 
nearly frozen Aunt Carolyn, but just 


look at our lovely snowman. I’m as 
proud of it as Jimmy is.” 
During the night the. weather 


turned unexpectedly warmer and the 
sun came out like a big ball of fire 
next morning. Nita had slept late, 
and Aunt Carolyn was putting on 
the breakfast when she came running 
down stairs. “I must go out to say’ 
good morning to my snowman,” said 
Nita. She ran to the window. In a 
minute she was back, and there were 
tears in her eyes, 

“The snowman has melted away,” 
she said. “He’s gone. All 
That’s just the way—things go.” 
Nita was very quiet while they ate 
breakfast. They were just finishing 
when there was a knock at the door 
and litltle Jimmy came shvly in. “Our 
snowman’s melted,” said Nita, trying 
to smile. 

“Oh, well. don’t you mind.” said 
Jimmy. “Mother says that when the 
snow begins to melt that’s a sign 
spring is coming, with all the nice 
flowers. And I like flowers better 
than snow.” 

Nita’s face lit up. “That's richt.” 
she said, and she turned to smile at 
Aunt Carolyn. “TI had forgotten about 
the spring.”

South to Benefit 


By French Revival, 
States Corrigan 


] 
John Corrigan, dr., of Atlanta, de- 
tailed as consul at La Havre, France, 


reached Atlanta yesterday in clothes 
that looked like they came from 
Peachtree street rather than the Rue 
de la Paix, spoke without oo la las, 
Oui, oui’s or frenzied gesticulation 
and showed by the increased number 
of his grey hairs that a consul’s life 
is not all beef and skittles or cognac 
and pate de fois gras, or all it is 
cracked up to be by our present-day 
and bygone fictionists. 

Mr. Corrigan has been on duty for 
two ywars at La Havre and will re- 
turn to that post when his six weeks’ 
leave of absence expires. 

_ He speaks hopefully of the French 

Situation. “As soon as the problem 
of reparations assumes any definite 
shape and the adverse rate of ex- 
change is remedied, the tremendous 
recuperative power of the French re- 
public will show itself,’ says Mr. Cor- 
rigan. 

‘The south will benefit, too, for as 
soon as France is on its feet, the 
manufacturers will be on the market 
ffor more American cotton than ever 
before, while the war taught them the 
advantages of American agricultural 
machinery. 

Mr. Corrigan was for a number of 
years Washington correspondent of 
The Constitution. He resigned when 
America entered the war and was 
commissioned a captain in the army, 
and served for 16 months in France. 
Following the war, he entered the 
American consular*service and is now 
a consul of career. 

“I feel like a countryman coming 
back to Atlanta after four years of 
absence,” he said. ‘Havre is as large 
or larger than Atlanta, having prob- 
ably 225,000 population; is an im- 
portant business center and the second 
port of ‘Europe in the amount of cot- 
ton imports received. But when it 
comes to life and movement, oh my! 
what a difference. I am _ almost 
afraid to cross the streets here. At- 
lanta is running true to form in grow- 
ing overnight, whereas Havre is still 
suffering from the paralysis of the 
war.” 

Mr. Corrigan returned by the steam- 
er Paris, of the French line. He was 
a fellow passenger with Douglas 
Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, Mme. 
Emma Calve and Charles W. Morse. 

“Fairbanks is one of the most de- 
lightful fellows I ever met,” he con- 
tinned. “There is not the least bit 
of affectation about him. He is en- 
thusiastic over the future of the mo- 
tion pictnre industry, but modest as 
to his own leading part in that devel- 
opment. While in France he was 
seeking to arrange for the presentation 
of his latest picture, “The Three Mus- 
keteers,” in competition with a French 
film version now being shown.” 

Several Georgians have come to the 


years. Nathaniel FE. Stewart, of 
Americus. Ga.. after serving as consul 
general thronghout the Near East, as 
inspector of consulates, is now on 
temporary detail at the state denart- 
ment in Washington. North Win- 
ship, of Macon, is at Milan, and oth- 
ers are holding important posts. 


HARBOR INTERESTS 
TO OFFER CLAIMS 
TO STATE BOARD 


Representatives of harbor interests 
in Savannah, Brunswick and St. 
Mary’s will appear before the state 
harbor commission ‘Thursday in the 
governor's office to present the claims 
of those cities for recognition as the 
official “state port” of Georgia. The 
meeting will be held at 10 o’cloek in 
the office of Governor Hardwick and 
Secretary of State S. G. McLendon, 
who is president of the state harbor 
commission, will preside. ’ 

Among the Savannah men who will 
appear are J. F. C. Myers, chairman 
of the Savannah harbor commission, 
and Colonel A. R. Lawton. 

Recently President McLendon sent 
out letters to business interests and 
city officials of the three ports ask- 
ing them to appear before the com- 
mission and file information concern- 
ing their respective harbors which 
the commission will need in selecting 
an officia] port which eventually will 
be improved with state aid money. 


CANDY, COMPANY PLANS

A stock valued at approximately 
$60,000 and the building, valued at 
$40,000, was lost in the fire, which 
originated in an undetermined manner.

The Constitution’s Weekly Nove! 


THE GIFT SUPREME 
BY GEORGE H. ENGLAND 
(Copyright, 1922, for The Constitution) 


7 | Next Week, 
-4 “The Knight of the Lovely Land,” by Evelyn Campbell. 


(Gontinued From Yesterday) 
Meiny Stagg, at this precise hour, 
was sitting in the front window of 


Con Dougherty’s “Grapevine Cafe,” 
over a bottle of mountain dew and 
the remains of a breakfast so late 
it might almost have been designated 
a dinner,’ 

“Damn the luck!’ he grunted stu 
pidly, drumming on the dirty table- 
cloth with dirtier nails. “If things 
ain’t goin’ all to the fritz, I’m a re- 
former. Flora’s in the hospital—my 
ingll, Punk Flo—that’s another line 
cut out. Between the Jardin des 
Palmes an’ the Chateau Square she 
never cleaned up less’n fifty or sixty 
a week—most all clear velvet for me. 

“Then my gent has crabbed the 
Vinton game, till it ain’t producin’ a 
red. Old Vinton has quit, cold, an’ 
the young boob has copped off Muggs, 


“an’ the Graun skirt has croaked, an’ 


all them prescriptions is down to that 
damn mission—any old time I’m liable 
to get sloughed in—can you beat it?” 

Poisonously enraged, he picked up 
his whisky glass, poured himself a 
stiff drink and sucked the glass dry. 
Again he bleared out into the heat“and 
stifle ef the street. An oath burst 
from his loose lips. He crouched half- 
standing; his bloodshot eyes stared 
at the figure of a man striding rapid- 
ly along the opposite sidewalk—a man 
whose bearing spoke of energy, hope, 
eagerness—a man in every way the 
strong antithesis of his own sodden 
self, 

“Him!” he snarled, sinking back 
ggain into his chair, as this man turn- 
ed the corner into Salem street and 
vanished. “Him, so help me! The 
damn silk-stokin’ missioner—an’ pik- 
in’ toward St. Philip’s, too!” 

A dawning thought of dread pos- 
sessed his muddled brain. 

“Huh? S’pose Muggs an’ Dan has 
‘spilled it to him, where the girl is? 
An’ cut me out o’ the chance of sell- 
in’ him that info, too? If they have, 
if they have—” 

For very rage his mottled hands 
twitched spasmodically on the table. 
By chance they came in contact with 
the exceedingly keen and pointed steel- 
steak knife that had been brought to 
carve the porterhouse. _Instinctively 
Meiny clutched it by the handle. It 
jay so nicely in his bloated palm, 
balanced so truly, fitted his grasp with 
such perfection that a kind of bar 


barous thrill transfixed his heart. 
Furtively he glanced about, saw 
that no one was watching him; then, 
with a-quick gesture, slid the knife 
into his inside breastpocket. 
A few minutes later, having mate- 
rially lowered the liquor in the bot- 


" “We, he slouched out of the Grapevine,

the corner, disappeared from view.

were the longest and the most nerve- 
torturing of. his life. Bradford had 
to grip his self-control in both hands 
to maintain anything like the calm, 
necessary menta? balance he knew he 
must have for the supreme appeal he 
meant to make. | 

The girl’s sudden, noiseless’ appear- | 
ance ig the doorway thrilled him | 
through and through. As he stood | 
up and faced her, he saw in one all- . 
enveloping sweep, of vision that the 


same Sylvia. still stood before him— _ 
a little paler form long night-vigils 


with the sick and dying, a little older | 
in certain indefinable maturities of | 


expression, and with a more maternal 
compassion looking from her blue- 
gray eyes, yet still the same yearned- 
for woman he had “loved and lost 
awhile.” 

For a moment neither of them 
moved or spoke, each studying the 
other, in an earnest gaze. Then, with 
a sudden gesture of appeal, she ask- 
ed. 

“Why have you come here?” 

“For you!’ He advanced toward 
her, but she put up her hand in nega. 
tion, and drew back. 

“Oh, if I'd known it was you, Brad- 
ford, who wanted to see me—”’ 

“You'd have refused?’ 

She nodded silently. 

“It’s all so futile,” she answered. 
“So futile and so full of pain! Why 
open up old wounds that try to heal? 
I hoped this place would be my sanc- 
tuary. I dreamed of peace and safety, 
here, in this!’ She dropped her hands 
sweepingly along-her nurse’s costume, 
as if it had been a nun’s robe. 

“If you knew the work I’ve been 
doing, Sylvia, and am doing—” 

“I know everything Bradford. It’s 

wonderful! Nothing must ever stop it, 
now. Nothing must ever come between 
you and that labor.” 
“Good!” He stretched out ‘appeal- 
ing hands. “Couldn’t we have worked 
together, Sylvia? Couldn’t we have 
co-operated? Couldn’t we have—” 

“No,” she denied, shaking her head. 
“I'd only have been a handicap on you 
in innumerable ways. After the horri- 
ble charges made against me—” 

“Damnable lies, as I know now!” 
he interrupted savagely. “I’ve got the 
proof.” 

“Proof-?”’ 

“Yes. It’s all open to me, now, as 
a book, the villainy that drove you 
away. My. father’s conspiracy with 
Irvin Stagg, and—” 

“When did you find out, Bradford?” 

“Just a few hours ago, from a dope 
fiend I’m trying to cure.” 

Sylvia smiled oddly. 

“T only learned last night, myself," 
said she. “From a dying woman of the 
streets. Strange, isn’t it, how things 
happen in this world?” 

“You know?” he demanded eagerly 
“You know the whole story, too?” He 
grasped the back of a chair with trem.- 
bling hands, as he stood facing her, 
and peered at her with eager-burning 
eyes, 

“Shhh, Bradford! 
she cautioned him. 


Not so loud!” 
“Yes, I know the

“Sylvia !” 

“What is it?’ 

“Why not—why not come back to 
me, now? Now that we both under-

been put over on ‘you? Why not? 
Come back’ to me—let’s start all over 
again. you and I, with unshaken faith 
and trust in each other—with eyes

blind to the past and say ta only the 


future—”’ 

He drew a step nearer; but she re- 
pelled him, still, with her uplifted 
hand. 

“Don't, Bradford!” she entreated. 
“This is something to be solved by 
reason, not by emotion. By the head, 
not the heart. Even though every 
accusation against me were technical- 
ly disproved, I'd be a drag on you, all 
your life. Nothing really is disproved, 
in the public mind. Once a charge is 
made, some of it always sticks. Al- 
ways some taint remains, especially in 
the case of a woman. 

“No, Bradford. If that were all, I'd 
let my heart rule my head. But there’s 
a great deal more. Your family is still 
there. an impassable barrier between 
us. Your father’s opposition is still 
alive, more uncompromisingly biiter 
than ever. If I were to go back to 
you, with that opposrcton still active, 
there could be no security for either 
of us, no peace, no happiness, no 
chance for constructive and enduring 


work. Sooner, or later he’d devise oth- 
er means to discredit and ruin me. 


And in the end he'd succeed in turning 
oninion avainst me. If evidence were

hacking, he’d have it manufactured. 
Money can do all that, and more. I 
know what the future: would hold in 
store for us, Bradford—for you, if I 
consented to what you're asking. I'd 
only be ruining you. No, no, there can 
be nothing more between us, as long 
as he objects.” 

“As long as he objects 


“Which means—forever.” 

Vinton could find no answer, for he 
knew the truth was with her. Still, he 
did not wholly despair. He ttretched 
out both apjealing hands with a cry. 

“Good-by,” said Sylvia, stretching 
out her hand to him, absolute finality 
in her voice. A moment, and she was 
gone—gone silently to the hidden, .in- 
ner places of the House of Pain; and 
Bradford, ont on the sidewalk once 
more, was plodding wearily back to- 
ward the Haven. 

Spent,- broken, crushed, Bradford 
slowly and dejectedly returned to the 
Haven, planless and miserable beyond 
all telling. Exhausted as he was, he 
nevertheless went out into the kitchen 
to make sure that preparations were 
under way for a good, substantial 
supper, against the coming of “his 
boys” from work. Then he returned 
to the deserted dining room, sat down 
in a chair close by the door that 
opened into Moon court, and, bowing 
his head on his arm along the edge 
of the table, drew the long, tremulous 
sigh of a man close to the brink of 
absolute exhaustion. 

And at this moment the spirit of 
murder entered the Little Haven in 
the venomous, slimy person of Meiny 
Stagg. 

At the door Meiny paused a second. 
swept the prospect and found it safe. 
His cowardly heart would risk no 
chance of conflict or retaliation. Se- 
cretly he hoped to strike and unde- 
tected slide away, back underneath the 
surface of his stagnant tarn. His 
bleared, whisky-reddened eyes shifted 
about the dining room as he advanced 


93> 


across the threshold silently, crouch- 
ing, big-paunched, unwholesome as a 
toad. His hand, deep in his pocket. 
seemed grasping something as he crept. 
close! 

All at once, measuring the distance 
of his stroke, he withdrew from his 
pocket his mottled hand—his hand 
that gripped a_ freshly-ground sstee! 
steak-knife. 

“Hey, you!” shouted a sudden voice 
from the door of the living room, where 
the cripple appeared, staring with ter- 
ror. “Drop dat, you!” 

Meiny shot a poisonous glance at 
the twisted little figure, now hobbling 
forward at its best speed, but answered 
nothing. Even a 
warning before it strikes, but Meiny’s 
sodden soul—if soul he had—dwelt in 
far fouler depths than any serpent’s. 

At sight of the steel, flickering in 
the air, Joe set up a wild, ear-piercing 
scream of terror. 

Startled from his reverie, Bradford 
turned.. The knife, aimed to shear 
through the back-muscles and between 
the ribs right to the heart, drove up 
to its handle in his left lung. 

With clutching hands that struggled 
to grip the table-edge Bradford la- 
bored to rise. A strange choking cough 
burst from his lips, now salt with the 
taste of blood—and on the whitewash- 
ed wall that seemed to dance and 
shimmer before his eyes a bloody rain 
grew visible, a bright crimson arc spat- 
tered there by his agonizing gasping. 

Cursing, Meiny snatched out the 
knife and lifted it, dripping, for an- 
other stab. 


But Joe’s crutch, smashing down 
upon his head, sent the blade spinning 
into the sawdust. With some super- 
human effort the cripple had managed 


rattlesnake giver} ’ 


to throw himself forward, to stand 
& moment unsupported, to deal a 
paralyzing blow, 

Meiny croucheu, his plans thrown 


out of joint by this unexpected at-) 


tack. He had expected a quick kill 
and an easy, undiscovered get-away. 
His liquor-fuddled wits had taken no 
aceount of the cripple. Now he faced 
disaster. A second he“paused, trying 
to think. Yes, he would kill the boy, 
too—the only witness. He bent, his 
hand stretched toward the knife. But 
now again that terrible ear-piercing 
shriek of Joe’s chilled the foul blood 
in his veins. 


' 
Heavy footfalis and other erjes from 


the kitchen, the living room and above- 
stairs, numbed his vulture-heart with 
panic. 


} 
' 


Bradford, who had half struggled to 
his feet, fell forward on the table—all 
things now fused in blackness before 
his eyes—and slid limply to the floor. 
Turning toward the street, the mur- 
derer broke into a staggering run. 

Joe, braced against a table, hurled 
his crutch with his last ounce of en- 
ergy, just before his anemic body 
collapsed in a dead faint of horror. 
The crutch whirled clattering against 
the doorway and fell across it, precise- 
ly as Méiny reached it in headlong 
panic. 

Tripped by the missile, the spawn of 
Irvin Stagg stumbled over it and dove 
headlong. Spewing obscene curses he 
sprawled across the sidewalk as some 
of Bradford’s men burst into the din- 
ing room, where now, face-downward 
in the blood-drabbled sawdust, their 
stricken leader lay.

Billy Gibson writes 


question: Writes Bill: 


“Saw Tex Rickard’s statement in which he intimates that 
the reason for Benny Leonard's refusal to box in Madison 
Square Garden is that he demands ‘set-ups’ as* opponents and 
that Riekard demands he make weight, which it is alleged 


Benny refuses to do. 


“Since the inception of the Walker law, Benny Loenard has 
boxed two championship contests in Madison Square Garden, 
The first of these matches, Leonard 
vs. Joe Welling, was promoted by Rickard. However Miss Anne 
Morgan staged the Leonard-Mitchell affair, the proceeds of- 
which went to devastated France, while the Ward exhibition 
was for the benefit of the Jewish hospital in the Bronx. . 

“In both of his championship battles Leonard weighed in at 
134 pounds at 2 p. m., one pound under the recognized class 


and one exhibition bout.

the country, barring this same Rickard. 

“With best wishes for Benny and myself, I am, sincerely, 


This looks like a good chance for some of the other promoters—

with Tendler. 


_ They would be. 


WHITE WANTS 
A CHANCE. 

Another young wan who has been 
campaigning for another bout with 
the champion is Charlie White. White 
writes that the fight he gave Leon- 
ard. when they last met—when he 
knocked Benny. out of the ring and 
bad him in serious trouble before the 
champion riilied and flattened White 
in the last round—entitles him to a 
return ma th. 

That weuld be a good champion- 
ship bout, better, perhaps, than one 
berween Leonard and Tendier. White 
has been winning steadily during the 
last few months, and shows the same 
old wallop. Aside from his hard hitt- 
ting, White isn’t Leonard’s equal. He 
lacks Benny’s . wonderful change- of 
pace, and ability to fight desperate- 
ly when in trouble. 


WANTED: 
AN OPPONENT. 

“TI don’t draw a color line, and I

ALWAYS 
IN SHAPE. . 

IHlarry ills, by the way, is very 
different from Jack Johnson, whose 
actions during the time he held the 
championship caused practically all 
of the prejudice against colored box- 
ers, He is a Jongshoreman, and wlfen 
not busy with some match goes back 
to his regular job of loading ships 
ut the New York wharves. 

Incidentally this makes him an ex- 
eeedingly dangerous fighter, for he 
never grows fat and soft. He is al- 
ways in condition. Along the water 
front they like to tell stories about 
Wills’ feats of strength. A favorite 
trick of his is to walk up a gang plank 
with a big -barrel on bis shoulders— 
2 load for two strong men. 

If Dempsey put in his spare time 
hetween bouts at one of his old trades, 
lumbering, road building, or mining, 
he'd last longer as a champion and 
be a tough man to handle for many 
years. However, no’ champion ever 
did anything like that, so Jack lacks 
an inspiring example. 

‘Bob Fitzsimmons came nearest to it, 
for he had a habit of hunting up a 
horseshoer's shop in every town he v‘s- 
ited, and spending a couple of hours 
turning out horse shoes. As for the 
rest of them, Sullivan never drove a 
cab or played semi-pro ball after be- 
coming a ring .champiin; Corbett 
didn’t even sweep out a bank; Nhar- 
key never sailed any ships; Jeffries 
cut out the boiler shop: Burns aban- 
doned lacrosse; Johnson didn’t go 
back to Teégding cotton bales on the 
Galveston wharves, and Willard never / 
drove a six-horse team or punched cat- 
tle while the crown was.tilted athwart 
his battling brow.

MAJORS’ DEAL 
IS HELD UP 


New York, January 4-—A hitch in 
the proposed three-cornered trade ot: 
baseball 
ington, Boston and Philadelphia teams 
of the American league, by which 
Roger Peckinpaugh, former, captain 
of the Yankees, would- become manager 
of the Se:.ators, developed today ata 
conference between Clark Griffith, 
owner of the Nationals, and Harry 
Frazee, head of the Red Sox. : 

Griffith came to New York especial- 
ly to talk over the deal with Frazee, 
and returned to Washingten without 
any definite understanding having been 


Frazee stated after the conference 
that there was nothing he could say 
other than that the proposition had 
gone through, and that it remained 
for Griffith to make the next-move. 

It was understood that both club 
owners bad been in communication 
with Connie Mack, who is in Texas 
az‘ that word was being - awaited 
from him before the transaction could 
be consummated. 

Phe trade was «aid to include .send- 
ing Joe Dugan to the Red.Sox and 
Joe Judge and Outfielder Bing Miller 
to the Athletics. Other players also 
were reported to be involved. 

Later Mr. Frazeé said that Mr. 
Griffith advised him that he could ob- 
tain Dugan from the Philadelphia elub 
and trade him to Boston for Peckin- 
paugh, the Boston magnate said that 


he wanted additional players, and that 


Mr. Griffith’s refusal to make the 
trade other than on even terms caused 
the hitch. 


N. 0. BOOKIES 
IN TROUBLE 


New Orleans, January 4.—Forty- 
seven bookmakers, together with their 
forty-seven cashiers, operating at the 
Fair Grounds race track, were tech- 
nically arrested at the conclusion of to- 
day’s racing card by being directed to 
report to the sheriff's office on war- 
rants issued on information furnished! 
by District Attorney Marr, charging 
violation of the Locke antii-gambling 
law. Bond was fixed in each case at 


The action of the district attorney 
in causing tne arrest oz all the book: 
makers, or “oralizers,” as they are 
called here, marks the resumption of 
the fight he started agailnst alleged 
race track gambling at last winter’s 
meeting. A large number of suits in- 
stituted by the district attorney at that 
time are still pending inthe state 
courts. 


Secured Injunction. 


At the time the suits were instituted | 
last season, the bookmakers, working 
in conjunction with. officials of the 
Busines 
promoters 
Grounds track, secured an injunction 
restraining the district attorney and 
other parish and state officials from in-| 
terfering with the system of laying! 
wagers at the track, and udder this 
injunction, they were permitted to 
complete the meeting undisturbed. 

The oral method of laying bets at 
the track, which the district attorney 
contends is in violation of the Locke 
law, consists of the bettor securing 
from the bookmakers the odds offered. 
The name of the horse to: bet on, the 
position ‘to be played, the odds and the 
amount of the wager, are written by 
he bettor on a slip of paper, signed by 
him and turned over to the bookmaker. 
If the horse wins, the bettor collects 
by applying to the cashier and. identify- 
ing himself by signing his name along- 
side of the original signature. 

. Might End Racing. . 


‘What effect the arrest of ‘the book- 
makers will have on the winter racing 
season here has not been determined. 
It is known that officials of the Busi- 
ness Men’s Racing association have 
had under consideration various con- 
tingencies which may arise in connee- 
tion with the district attorney's fight 
on the oral system, but no gnnounce- 
ment has been: made of their probable 
action. 

An unconfirmed report was current 


late today that.today’s action meant* 


the death knell for winter racing in 
New Orleans, that the meet would be, 
called off tomorrow, but this was given 
little credence among followers of the 
sport. “Another report, also  uncon- 
firméd, was that the Fair Grounds 
meet would be transferred to the 
Shrewsbury track, in Jefferson parish. 
just outside the city, where a thirty- 
day racing program. was finished las’ 
Saturday.

Pete Daley has picked a winner, and 
it’s the Atlanta Athletic club. 


| This announcement is important 
because it marks the first time that 
this venerable basketball rooter - has 
fever predicted anything exeept the 
hardest sort. of battle for the bas- 
keteers on Auburn avenue, Pete, as a 
rule being So anxious for the club to 
win that !« can do nothing except 
dream of the possibilities of the lo- 
cals suffering defeat. 

But Pete asserts this time that 
the A. A. C, is going to lick the Spar- 
tanburg Y. M. C. A., and he does so 
because the Carolinians doubted the 
ability of Atlanta turning the .trick 
last year. , 

“Il watched the Clemson Y. M. C. A, 
come to Atlanta with feak and trem- 
bling,’ Colonel Daley asserted. ‘Ibe 
coming of the Camp Benning outfit 
made ine sit up nights and wonder if 
the club was going to win. I dreaded 
seeing the boys against the Central 
college five. In other words, 1 haven't 
had an easy day’ since the season 
started.” 

“I know the team is just about the 
greatest that Atlanta bas ever had,” 
Pete continued. “But against the 
teams I[ just mentioned 1 never heard 
a single one of the A. A. C. players 
offer any pre-game desire to win. 
They simply took it for granted that 
they were going to do it and let the 
matter drop. 

“But there’s a different atmosphere 
around the clubhouse now,” Pete 
stated. “I’ve heard more than one 
of the men assert that they are going 
out to lick Spartanburg as much as 
the law will allow; they’re going to 
battle. from the start to the finish. 
Doing that, I am satisfied that A. A. 
C. will win every game on the sched- 
ule and bring home-the national cham- 
pionship for good measure,” 

Pete declares that the action of the 
Spartanburg officials last year in ex- 
pressing doubts over whether the local 
varsity could have improved on the| 
showing made by Bean’s reserves ‘has 
made the Auburn avenue clubmen mad 
as hornets. "They're out gunning now. 
The writer knows of at least two At- 
lantans that are confident Atlanta is 
going to win, and by no little margin, 
either. 

However, Coach Bean isn’t confi- 
dent, but for that matter were his 
stalwarts facing the BingVille Baracas, 


Joe would register distress: until -

the struggle went on sale yesterday,

COACH BIBLE WON’T 

COACH THE PETRELS. 

Returning from an unusually good 
supper last night, radiating good 
cheer from. the fact that Wednesday 
had been pay day, and that our usual. 
flock of creditors had failed to put in 
an appearance, we found this note in 
our typewriter: 

Cliff: Clark Howell, Jr., tele- 
phones that Bible—whoever he 
is—has«. declined OUgiethorpe’s 
coaching offer, though he regrets 
he can not come to Atlanta. 
Aforementioned Bible—probably 
the nNing.James version—has just 
aecepted offer of $5,500 to con- 
tinue as coach of Texas A. and 
M. next year, and I don’t blame 

‘him a bit, for I'd coach Tuskegee 
or pull up young corn_or slit in- 
fants’ goozles for haif the amount, 

Also Bible has been appointed a 
member of: the coaches’ commit- 
tee on rules; the coaches, proba- 
bly figuring that his name will 
exert a behign influence and ex- 
cuse some of their rascalities. 
Anyhow, I’m not acquainted with 
this Bible, which,.I am informed, 
does not begin with Genesis. and. 
doesn’t end with Revelations, 
which is the dickens of a Bible to 
write about.” 

Howsomever, 1 am kwite koh- 
fident you can produce some- 
thing illuminating, erudite, syllo- 
gistic and startling ad this form 
of the Holy Writ. Go to it, kid. 

(Sig MR. WOODRUFF. 
This Biblé is being discussed in the 

homes of southern football fans at this 
time about as often as the other Bible 
is being read. Coach Bible is the gen- 
tleman who coached the Texas Aggies. 
for that memorable victory over the 
Centre Colonels a few days ago. 

Report early yesterday had it that 
the Oglethorpe Petrels were about to 
sign him as their coach for the fall, 
campaign, and the rumor created quite 
a bit of excitement. Bible is, one of 
the most capable football men in the 
south, and it is to be regretted that he 
has elected to stay in Texas. He 
would have looked mighty good at the 
head of Oglethorpe’s gridiron war- 
riors next season. ' 

Coach Bible. was in the army with 
e number -of Atlantans during the 
world war and is well-known here. ' 


COACH ALEX | 
"TS PLEASED 


- BY JOHN STATON. 

.. ... Tech’s Left End. 

' Coach Alexander, who bas just re- 
turned from the coaches’ meeting in 
New York, was very optimistic over 
the results of the conference, or to 
put it better, the iack of results. The 
coaches met and talked a lot, but 
above that nothing of special signifi- 
eance was accomplished. The most 
important bit of legislation was the 
recommendation of the coaches to the 
effect that the rules governing foot- 
ball should remain just as they. are. 

If this recommendation is adopted 
by the rules committee—and there is 
every reason to believe that it will 
be—football will become a better game 
every year. If the rules remain un- 
changed, it will allow the game to 
become standardized. It will give the 
game a chance to catch up with itself. 

With new rules infused into the 
system,.there naturally appears & cor- 
responding increase in freak plays, 
plays which aim to get the advantage 
on a technicality. 

A new rule is a golden opportunity 
for some coaches to hatch out a play, 
based on the new rule, which play is 
usually illegal, or at least untair foot- 
ball. So it is.to be hoped that the 
rules committee will see fit to adopt 
the recommendation of the coaches, 
and give the game a chance to be- 
come standardized. 

Of course, there was the usual pow- 
wow about the jump shift, but that 
system of play has gained such favor 
awong the coaches that the dissent- 


ing voices were few and far between. 
The jump shift is thoroughly sound 
football, and has come to stay. 

Some of the coaches favored making 
the field goal in basketball count 
more than two points. They argued 
that the best team is often beaten by 
free throws: The free throw is a 
good thing, but does not involve any 
sport. It is a comparatively easy 
matter to stand still, take aim and 
then pitch the ball through the loops 
for one point. This matter was put 
on the shelf after some discussion, 
so if any change is made it will be 
made in 1923.

NEGRO TO HANG 
FOR MURDER 
OF WHITE MAN 


Thomson, Ga., 

cial.)—Claud Dunn, 
with the murder of Gustavus E. 
Reese, prominent McDuffie county 
farmer, this afternoon was _ found 
guilty and sentenced to hang January 
24. 
The trial was held at a spetial ses- 
sion and the most important evidence 
offered by the state was given by the 
defendant’s son, Robert Wylie UVunn, 
who declared his father attacked Mr. 
Reese and was cutting him in the 
back of the head. 

Young Dunn declared he was cut 
in attempting to save the white man. 
After compelling Reese to unbreach 
his shotgun and remove the shells, he 
testified, Dunn then took his own 
gun and snot him. 

The défendant asserted that Reese 
was killed during a struggle for pos- 
session of a shotgun. After Keese 
was dead, Dunn testified, with the 
assistance of Clark Smith, a negro 
preacher, he wrapped the body in a 


negro, charged 


The jtiry was out only a few min- 
utes in reaching a verdict. Smith 
and other negroes charged with being 
accessories in the crime will be tried 
at the regular term of court here in 
March.

THE BIG REFORM 

The big reform that seems certain 
to come out of the organization of the 
coaches is that they will put a quick 


check upon the extension of the foot- 
ball season through the winter and 
check or stop the custom of long trips 
and taling students away from their 
studies for weeks. The tendency to- 
ward advertising and gate réceipts by 
long trips certainly is incompatible 
with opposition to professional foot- 
ball, for by such trips, taking students 
away for weeks, the colleges border 
upon professionalism themselves, 

The organization of the coaches is 
certain to actas a deterrent. They see 
the dangers to the sport more clearly 
than others do, and they are determin- 
ed to remedy them for themselves with- 
out waiting for public opinion to be 
aroused to a point where it will com- 
pc’ reforms in the sport. 
FOOTBALL MYSTERY 
EXPLAINED. 


One of the mysteries of football dur- 
in the last season was the failure of 
the University of Pennsylvania 
team. It was hard to figure that 
a university with 13,000 students 
could turn out such poor material. If 
13,000 students Gould produce only a 
145-pound back, one of the smallest 
squads in the country and one of the 
worst teams ever seen representing a 
major school, something was wrong. 
Many of. the critics fell upon John 
Heisman, the studious, and upon his 
assistants. .Of course a coach must 
shoulder the bulk of the blame when 
his team goes wrong, but every one in 
football Or knowing the game under- 
stands that the coach seldom is to 
blame, 

I have just learned what the trouble 
is at Penn. Heisman, of course, can- 
not say anything and can only grin 
and do the best he can. But one who 
knows Penn inside out tells the story. 

“Heisman is really a great coach,” 
hs said, “one of the best, and he had a 
capable and efficient and hard-work- 
ing corps of assistants. It was a 
coaching staff that could bave taken 
almost anv minor college and made a 
sensational team, but it could do noth- 
ing with Penn. 

“You would think that with 18,000 
enrolled any one could pick a good 
team. The first big trouble is in the 
enrollment itself. Deducting the spe- 
cial students, the freshmen, the wom- 
en, the summer students and the post 
grads and others who are barred from 
athletic competition, there are about 
2,000 from whom a team can be se- 
lected. That is enough. The fact is, 
however, that the University of Penn- 
sylvnnia is terribly overcrowded and 
the faculty would be glad to see a few 
thousand less. They are not seeking 
students, and while not antagonistic 
to football, they are not particularly 
interested. The application lists are 
filled and the waiting list long. If a 
good football player from some prep 
school wants to enter Penn he not only 
is not encouraged, but no effort Is 
made to get him in; in fact, if any- 
thing, preference is given others. I 
know last fall three of the great prep 
school stars of Pennsylvania chose 
Penn, wanted it and were wanted. 
They were not solicited, but came seek- 
ing education, and they were refneed 
admission because their applications 
had not been made in proper form at 
the proper time.

Perhaps the biggest forward step yet taken in football was the 
organization of the American Football Coaches’ association in New 
York. The formation of this association means a straight-fight of the 
sollege coaches and athletic directors, backed by the faculties and 
student sentiment, against professiona] football.

scouting and the danger of professionalism creeping into the college 


It means a clearer

are entirely in earnest, and the character. of the leaders of the move- 
ment is a guarantee that they seek reform, 


It indicates that the coaches 


= 


Heisman ever had the same eleven men 
out for practice two days in suecessign 
during the season, 

THEY COME 

TO LIFE, 

“The team rallied for the Dartmouth 
game and made a nice showing. It 
was #eemingly coming to life. But for 
the fact that Dartmouth plared its 
best game of the season against Penn, 
Penn would bave won by a big score. 
The coaches were encouraged, They 
thought the tide had turned and the 
team would come to life. The players 
seemed to take new beart. 

“At the next practice the coaches, 
six of them in uniform, were on the 
field waiting at 3:30. They waited 
fora long time. Some one asked Heis- 
man if he had called off practice and 
learned that he had not. At 4:30 
there were six players on the field: 
not one first team man, not one sec- 
ond m man among them; they were 
third string and fourth string players. 
The others failed to show up. 

“After the season was over Mr. 
Heisman evolved a fine plan to get out 
material. He declared for devoting 
the entire month of December to foot- 
ball training for all students. He in- 
vited every. student to come out and 
join. Besides bulletins and printed 
notices in the ‘varsity publications 
he made a list of about 150 ‘fellows 
eligible to play, who from physical ex- 
amination had shown they had the 
weight and other requisites for foot- 
ball. He wrote each of those a per- 
sonal appeal. About fifty replied giv- 
ing more or less good excuses why ther 
could not accept. Just nine respond- 
ed with whole hearts, ready for work. 
The others did not even reply to the 
coach's invitation. 

“From those facts it ought to be 
clear what the trouble with footbal! 
at Penn is,” 

Now we understand.

Stocks Are Expected — 
To Suffer Further Losses 


BY R. L. BARNUM 


New York, January 4——The movement of prices on the stock ex- 
change today was irregular as was to be expected following the session 


of violent liquidation on Tuesday. 
were below the minimums of the previous session, but the — did ; 
not end without the customary rallies due to short covering. 


Prices during the morning hours: 


nsider- 


able confusion exists here as' to the course of prices in the immediate 
future. Some interests are of the belief that the selling of Tuesday was 
considerably overdone, and that a trading market can be looked for for | 


a few weeks at least. 


The consensus of opinion is that following a 


further reaction, prices will again gradually work higher. , 
' Some of the weak features of today’s market included’ Genera 


Motors and Sinclair Consolidated. 


The former established a new low 


record, the decline being based upon the assumption that the directors 
will pass the quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share at their meeting to 
be held after the close of the market. Wall street gossip has it that tie 
executive committee has recommended the passing of the dividend for 
reason of conservatism. The company, it is understood, must make fur- 
ther heavy adjustments of inventory and bank loans and accounts ard 
bills payable are reported to be large. 

It is again rumored here that there will be a change in the manage- 
ment of the Sinclair Consolidated corporation, although nothing official 
can be learned here in view ef the company’s strict policy to disregard 
all rumor. The report, however, ig that the Standard Oil company of 
Indiana, which is already interested in the Sinclair pipe line, will even- 
tually acquire a substantial interest in the parent company. 

Call money after opening at 51-2 per cent, dropped to 4 per cent in 


the early afternoon. 


Oil Loan Reported. 

The meeting of the stockholders of 
the Haskill Barke company to vote 
their approyal for the sale of the prop- 
erty to the Pullman company has been 
postponed until January 12. 

It is reported that the Standard Oil 


The drop in the rate had only a slight effect on 
security prices. Time money is obtainable in large blocks at 5 per cert. 
A similar rate has been reported on several occasions recently but up to 
the present only small amounts were available at that rate.

Company of California~is negotiating 
to arrange a $40,000,000 loan in the

This money, according .to the report,

The Pennsylvania has announced the 
placing of an order for 80.000 tons of 
rails for 1922 delivery. Last year the 
road placed contracts for 200,000 tons 
of rails. 

Montgomery Ward sales for De- 
eember were $7,425,000, against $10.- 
050,000 for the same period of 1920. 
For the year the figures were $75,956,- 
0U0, against $112,333.000. 

Your correspondent had a short talk 
today with one of the leading bankers 
in Wall street. 

“What do you see now?” he was 
asked, 

Here was the reply: “We can not 
set a better line on our domestic situa- 
tion than by watching what the farm- 
ers are buying as shown in the large 
mail order houses. What I have said 
to you many times before can not be 
repeated too often. Things here are 
not going to get right until the agri- 
cultural situation is straightened out 
either by an increase in the prices of 
what the farmers have to sell or in a 
decline in the prices of what the farm- 


‘er buys. 


The volume of exports from America 
declined because of impoverished con- 
dition of European countries rather 
than through weakening of demand for 
our goods. Hardening of foreign ex- 
change in December indicated revival 
of confideneé in the international sit- 
uation, Betterment of exchange, how- 
ever. was disappointing in that its ap- 
preciable increase in foreign buying 
did not accompany it.”

Trust company, is' making a_ public

GOOD ADVANCES 


Chicago, January 4—Readiness 
with which all margin calling was met 
today on,the exchange, even ‘where 
the amounts demanded were excessive, 
had a decidedly stimulating effect on 
the grain markets here, Wheat closed 


strong at 3 to 3 7-Se net higher, with | 


May $1.11 1-2 to $1.11 5-8 and July 
$1.01 to $1.01 1-8. Corn gained 
1 3-8 to 1 5-8c; oats, 7-8 to le and 
provisions, 2 1-2 to 20 cents. 

The fact that rumors of impending 
financial trouble for board of trade 
firms had in every instance failed to 
be substamtiated, and that ample 
funds were shown to be available, led 
to general buying and a sharp ad- 
vance as soon as the wheat market 


spread that yesterday's selling was 


of offerings. Another bullish influ- 


ence wag gossip that export business | 


on a liberal scale was in progress and 
that purchases for Europe during yes- 
terday’s depression amounted to 1,- 
000,000 bushels. Absence of moisture 
in the dry sections of Texas, Okla- 
homa and Kansas, together with un- 
welcome rains in Argentina, tended 
also to renew bullish sentiment. On 
the price bulges some heavy selling, 
ascribed to eastern interests, was en- 
countered, but reactions that ensued 
were transient, and the finish was near 
the top figures of the day. 

Corn and oats advanced with wheat, 
Shipping demand for the feed grains 
appeared more active. On the other 
hand, country offerings had been 
largely shut off by yesterday’s break 
in prices, 

Notwithstanding irregularity in the 
hog market, provisions reflected the 
upturn of grain values.

Coffee. 


New York, Janua 4.—The market for 
coffee futures opened 2 points lower to & 
points higher. Eariy cabdies from Brasil 
showed small irregular chances and there 
was gome covering here after yesterday's 
decline, but the market weakened later 
owing to reports of @ decline in' Santos and 
talk of lower firm offers in the street. 
There was some trade selling on the set- 
back, which carried May contracts off to 
8.35 and September to 8.29. Closing prices 
were about the lowest of the day, showing 
net losses of 9 to 20 pointe: January, 8.42; 
March, 8.53; May, 8.35; July, 8.30: Septem- 
ber, 8.30; October, 8.30; December, 8.30, 
Sales were estimated at 32,000 bags. 

Spot coffee was quiet at 9% for Rio 7s,

Madge Kennedy (Herself ). 


( son age to Atianta Theatér.) 

Madge Kennedy, oneof the noted 
beauties of the stage, comes to the 
Atlanta theater three nights be- 
sinning next. Monday in Henry W. 
Savagg production of “Cornered,” 
direct” from a six months’ run at 
the Astor theater, New York. Miss 
Kennedy, who is one of the best 
known and beloved actresses of our 
Stage today, will be supported by 


innocent, round-eyed, 
modest type of young woman, Miss 


tion as a comedienne a few years 
ago when she was the originator 
and featured player of such roles 
in “Twin Beds” and “Fair and 
Warmer,” farce comedies, whose 
tremendous vogue was due in great 
part to the talent and personality 
of this young woman. By her ex- 
cellent work in plays of this charac- 
ter there is no doubt but what she 
outranked all feminine contempora- 
ries and became easily the leading 
comedienne of the American stage. 
About three years ago she went into 
motion pictures as a screen star, 
and had no trouble in immediately 
enhancing her reputation and add- 
ing new laurels by her splendid tal- 
ents, delectable beauty and rare per- 
sonality. In “Cornered,” written, 
by the way, by the actér&uthor, 
Dodson Mitchell, Miss Kennedy 
found the vehicle she searched for 
all the time she was appearing in 
the field of the camera. In it she 
Plays a dual role—a shabby shop 
girl, who associates with crooks, 
and a refined young heiress. To 
each character she is said to bring 
histrionic talents of a high degree, 
and her work in each was gener- 
ously acclaimed by criticis and the- 
atergoers alike during the run of 
the play on Broadway. Seats for 
the engagement go on gale today. 


Keith Vaudeville. 


(At the Lyrie.) 

“Rice Pudding,” the headline at- 
traction at Keith’s Lyric today, Fri- 
day and Saturday, is a tasty con- 
coction of Felix G. Rice’s. Its prin- 
cipal ingredients are youth, beauty 
and tunefulness. Mr. Rice, who 
has already won many laurels as 
a composer, is out to seek just as 
many in a new field, that of the pro- 
ducer and exploiter of juvenile tal- 
ent. A epcial scenic setting en- 
hances the offering and forms a 
delightful background for the work 
of the Misses Meadows, Arnst and 
Masters Roscoe and Poast, who, 
with Mr. Rice, compose the person- 
nel of the “Rice Pudding” act. 

Lynn and Lorayne, in “Beech 
Nuts.” offer a black and tan act, 
in which the characters are drawn 
60 true to life that in the north 
managers have felt it necessary to 
make public announcements that 
the team were really of the Cauca- 
sian race. 


Loew Vaudeville. 


(At the Grand.) 
A highly interesting and enter- 


the production of commodities entering 
into trade. . sk: 
Inflation hadits start in the United 
States during the war, when great 
amounts of bank credit were brought 
into use for the flotation of govern- 
‘ment loans and in response to the de- 
bands of business which was over- 
stimulated. After the war, following 
five months of slackening demands, 
business was again overstimulated, 
The demand for commodities ap- 
peared to exceed the supply, prices rose. 
more ¢tedit was wanted from _ the 
banks, and the latter, at first thinking 
it necessary to support the revival of 
the peace industries, responded. It 
soon developed, however, that the in- 
crease of bank loans was’ financing a 
competitive struggle for labor and 
s and forcing both wages and 
prices higher, in the same manner that 
issues of paper money would operate. 
In other words, the increasing 
amount of purchasing power put into 
effect by bank loans was deprciating 
the value of all money, including gold 
itself. Under ordinary conditons, with 
the rest of the world on the gold basis, 
as before the war, such an increase of 
bank loans in‘the United States ac- 
companied by rising prices, would 
have turned the trade balance against 
this country, caused exports of gold, 
and by the loss of bank reserves, com- 
pelled a restriction of lending, but with 
the trade balance heavily in our favor, 
|e steadying influence was not in ef- 
ect. 


The Stand Against Inflation. 
By the fall of 1919, the United 


States was in the grip of a cycle of} | 


rising prices and wages which began 
to alarm:-careful observers. The rail- 
road brotherhoods gave notice in Au- 
gust of their intention to strike unless 
wages were raised to compensate for 
the advancing cost of living. The move- 
ment for higher wages was gencral, 
and it was apparent that the higher 
wages, when granted, would again in- 
crease the cost of living, and that there 
would be no stoping place if the influ- 
ence of inflation was given free play. 

Thecountry atthattime was at the 
parting of the ways. The reserves of 
the federal reserve banks were down 
pactically to the limit set by the fed- 
eral reserve act—a limit fixed with 
careful and unbiased judgment when 
the act was passed before the war. The 
federal reserve act provides that the 
reserve requirements may be suspended 
for a period of thirty days, and that 
such suspension may be renewed for 
periods not exceeding fifteen days, but 
these are clearly emergency provisions. 
Moreover, the law provides that a 
graduated tax shall be levied upon the 
amount by which these reserves fal] 
below the regular limit, and also that 
the rate of the tax shal’ be added to 
the regular discount rates while the 
deficiency continues. These provisions 
cipariy show the purpose and spirit 
of the law. 


The banking situation had practical- 


ly reached the position where the law 
required these provisions to become ef- 
fective, and all signs indicated that 
unléss inflation was checked they must 
a automatically effective very

acter songs, and King brothers, 
Herculean athletes. The feature of

marked success at the Howard this 
week, 

In this first production to follow 
Mr. Ingram’s wonderful picturiza- 
tion of “The Four Horsemen of the 
Apocaf¥pse,” many of the specially 
perfected photography devices used 
in the filming of the Ibanez story

pictorial excellence of “The Con- 
quering Power.” You will also re-

OF WATER BOARD 


Receipts of Department 
for Year Total $906,- 
814.783— Atlanta Uses 
8,927,000,000 Gallons of 
Water. 


Officers were elected and a budget 


for the year adopted by the board of 
water commissioners at its first 1922 


meeting held at city hall Wednesday 
afternoon. W. E. Dunn was unani- 
mously re-elected president, making 
the eleventh consecutive time he has 
been chosen for this post, and William 
J. Davis was unanimously re-elected 


vice president. The term of each is 


one year. 

Superintendent W. Zode Smith sub- 
mitted the tentative 1922 budget ask- 
ing an appropriation for the water 
department’s operation and maifte- 
nance of practically the same amount 


expended last year. His report show- 
ed water receipts for 1921 of $906,- 
814.78, a falling off from receipts of 
1920, due, it was explained, to the 
abandonment of Camp Gordon and to 
decreased activity by many commer- 
cial plants during the business depres- 
sion of past months. Other receipts 
were $68,238. 

Among the appropriations approved 
was the sum of $20,864 to lay new 
water pipe in Ormewood; $5,000 to 
make water connections in Kirkwood ; 
25,000 for the purchase of new water 
pipe; $50,000 to provide for distribu- 
ting pipes on streets to be paved un- 
der the baby bond plan; $65,000 to 
make new water eonnections ; $193,000 
to buy fuel and supplies; $97,000 for 
general maintenance; $168,104 for pay 
rolls; $1, for service pipes; $3.- 
434 to cover expense incident to the 
widening of West Peachtree street; 
$12,900 to take care of expense in 
connection with widening Peachtree 
street; $1,837 to supply water to 
Washington park; $7.000 to complete 
—_ buildings; $8,000 for office sup- 
plies. - 

Atlanta used 8,927,000,000 gallons 
of water last year, according to figures 
of the superintendent, and-te deliver 
this tremenduous volume to the city 
the great pumps exerted a total force 
behind it sufficient to lift the entire 
quantity 567, feet high, or higher than 
the Washington monument. It re- 
quired 24,451 tons of coal] to do the 
pumping. 

Mr. Smith stated that there are over 


| 400 miles of water pipe in the city and 


17 miles of service lines, extending in 
streets where mains have not yet been 
laid. There are 34,144 water services, 
3,570 fire hydrants and 5,180 valves. 

Total operating expenses of the wa- 
terworks department, including main- 
tenance, interest and depreciation, 
amounted to $601,870.34.

IN AUTO ACCIDENT: =: 


Two Young Men and Two 
Girls Badly Bruised 
When Auto Skids Into 
Street Car. 


Four persons were badly bruised 
and shaken up when an automobile 
driven out Highland avenue by George 
W. MecWhite, Jr., skidded into an in- 
bound Highland avenue Street car near 
Highland View, shortly after 11 
o'clock Wednesday night. They are 
Miss Mary Love, of 11 Peachtree way ; 
Miss Laura Baker, of 427 Greenwood 
avenue; George W. McWhite, Jr., and 
J. H. McWhite, both of 24 St. Louis 
place. Mr. McWhite was driving the 
party home from an entertainment. 

After being given fifst aid treat- 
ment at the home of Mrs. S. M. Deans, 
960 Highland avenue, the injured peo- 
ple were taken to Grady hospital. 
After having their injuries ‘dressed 
they went home. The automobile was 
not badly damaged.

OPIE IN PROBE 


Continued from First Page. 


frankly but pathetically announced he 
could not read or write, cleared up his 
recent statement concerning the shoot- 
ing of a soldier because he had sneaked 
uway from his command to quench his 
thirst at a little spring. It developed 
that the command was trying to con- 
ceal its position from the enemy and 
that all hands had been warned that 
the first man attempting to walk out 
in the open would be shot. The sol- 
dier walked 50 yards beyond the dead 
line, refused to halt when ordered, and 
they shot him in his tracks. 

There was much testimony relating 
to executions at Is-Sur-Tille, none of 
the witnesses being able to say. wheth- 
er the victims had been tried beyond 
the claim of some to the contrary as 
the trap was sprung. War depart- 
ment records, containing the list of 11 
legal hangings, listed two at Is-Ssc- 
Tille. 

Served in Prison. 

Quite inadvertently, a member of 
the committee brought out during the 
poem ee of a former soldier that 
| since the war he had served 14 months 
in the Georgia penitentiary for steal- 
ing an automobile. No attempt was 

made, however, to discredit his testi- 
mony on that account. It related 
solely to executions, conducted pub- 
licly with soldiers drawn up as wit- 
nesses, in accordance with military 
regulations. 

After he had testified late today, 
Chairman Brandegee told St. John 
that he might return home, but the 
witness stated that Senator Watson 
had directed him to remain here over- 
night for further examination tomor- 
row. 

When asked to give the names of the 
four men with him at the time he is 
alleged to have seen Major Opie shoot 
a runner, St. John mentioned first 
Robert Barksdale, of Lynchburg, a 
cousin of one of the major’s lawyers, 


BETTER THAN

A BAD COLD 


New Elixir, Called Aspi-

The sensation of the year in the 
drug trade is Aspironal, the two-min- 
ute cold reliever, authoritatively guar- 
anteed by the laboratories; tested, 
approved and most enthusiastically 
endorsed by the highest authofities, 
and proclaimed by the cemmon peo- 
ple as ten times as quick and effec- 
tive as whiskey, rock and rye, or any 
other cold remedy they have ever 
tried. 

All drug stores are now supplied 
with the wonderful new elixir, so all 
you have to do to get rid of that-cold 
is to step into the nearest drug store, 
hand the clerk half a dollar for a bot- 
tle of Aspironal and tell him to serve 
you two teaspoonfuls with four tea- 
spoonfuls of water in a glass. With 
your watch in your hand, take the 
drink at one swallow and call for 
your money back in two minutes if 
you cannot feel your cold fading

it. 

When your cold or Sete due to a

burg, and Henry J. Burbee, of Law- 
rence, Mass. It was indicated that 
the committee would call them as wit- 


- Called as the “:st witness at the 
resumption of the hearing Hubbard de- 

clared there was nothing in the cof- 
rie by whicl the bodies could be iden- 


“The bodies were identified by the 
cross on the outside of the coffin and 
the black caps were not removec be- 
“ e the bodies were shipped to the 
United Sta:es for burial,” Hubbard 
testified. 

; to Detail. 

Describing his work i: the field as 
assistant embalmer, Hubbard went 
into great detail. while Chairman 
Brandegee was attempting to find out 
what be knew about charges of illegal 
hangings. 

“You've written a long letter. now 
tell us, in your wn way, what you 
know abort the hanging charges,” 
Chairman Brandegee insisted. 

“While at a vem*tery in France 
heiping to get the bodies ready for 
shipment home,” thc witness said, “I 
saw three hodies brought up with the 
rope and biack cap as_ they were 
when the men were hanged. I think 
two were negroes and one a white 
mm. I think it.wasa disgrace to the 
army ‘at the bodies went the par- 
ents withont the black - being re- 
moved.” The witness gave the names 
ot several persons who were present 
at the cemetery with him. - 

“There was too much hurry in the 
registration service.” he continned, 
“any many sad mistakes in identifica- 
tion were made.” 

No Tags on Bodies. 

“There were no tage on the bodier. 
of the three soldiers?” Senator Over- 

an, demotrat, North Caroiina, asked. 
olied. did not see one,” Hubbard re- 

e 

“Were bodies that were not proper- 
ly identified shipped home as identi- 
fied?’ Senator Brandegee asked. 

“They were,” Hubbard replied. 

Many women in the crowded com- 
miitee room whe lost sons overseas 
leaned forward and listened closely to 
Hubbard’s long recital of “careless- 
ness”’—some with tears in their eyes. 

“Do you know if those three men 
were executed in accordance with the 
law?” the chairman asked. 

“TI do not.” 

“Have you any evidence that the 
men were hanged without trial?’ 

“No, sir.’ 


Indentified By Crosses. 


Hubbard insisted that the bodies of 
the three soldies “hanged” were identi- 
fied by the cross on each grave, and 
he presumed they went to the right 
parents. 

“Are you prépared to swear there 
was no tag in any of the three cof- 
fins?” Senator Watson asked. 

Don I. Jacobson, formerly of New 
Haven, Conn., but now living at Guth- 
rie, Okla., was called next. 

Jacobson then told how he had put 
the noose around the neck of a negro 
soldier hanged after court-martial con- 
viction. After the hanging the body 
was cut down and a short stretch of 


rope left around the neck. he said. 

Answering Senator Watson, the 
witness said the man hanged was.a 
negro, convicted of rape, and he died 
proclaiming his innocence. 

Georgian Summoned. 

Polk Golden, a young farmer, of 
Newnan, Ga., who was living in ‘Ari- 
zona, when drafted and sent overseas, 
was questioned concerning a letter he 
recently wrote Senator Watson to the 
effect that a soldier was shot by or- 
ders of a major because he went to a 
spring to get a canteen of water. The 
men, he said, were ordered to remain 

under cover and a soldier disobeying, 
started toward the spring and was 
shot. A battle was raging nearby and 
guards, he said, were trying to conceal] 
the position of the squad. 

“How far was the man out when 
shot?” 

“Fifty yards. He was told to halt 
and refused. 
were not to approach the spring.” 

Golden then testified that he saw 
an officer shoot a private in the Ar- 
gonne sector. The man killed, he said, 
was an Italian from New York. 

“Any talk about it in your com- 
pany, or any complaint made?’ 

“IT didn’t hear any.” 

“After you saw the man fall dead 
you pet, out, did you? 


Why didn’t you make an inquiry to 
find why the man was shot?’ the 
chairman persisted. 

“I didn’t think about it.” 


Had Orders to Shoot. 


The officer, the witness added, 
stated that he had orders te shoot the 
man. 

“Can you read or write?’ Senator 
Watson asked Golden. 

“No, sir.’ 

The first flare of the day started 
when Emmett Cochran, of Savannah, 
Ga., was called. 

“What do you know about hang- 
ings?’ the chairman asked. 

“Nothing. I am here to answer 
a by Senator Watson,” he 
said. 

“Senator Watson has made no 
charges,” the Georgia senator shout- 
ed. “I think the witness should con- 
fine himself to evidence.” 

Cochran finally was permitted to 
read a letter from Colonel William 
Hayward, explaining why he had asi» 
ed Cochran be transferred to an- 
other command becaufe of the alleged 
shooting of a private in France. 

Cochran testified that he had been 
tried by court-martial and acquitted 
of charges of killing a soldier. Hx- 
plaining the circumstances of the 
shooting, Cochran, a lieutenant, said 
he had ridden into a town where sol- 
dier disorder had been reported. A 
negro in his command, he said, rush- 
ed up and seized his horse. When or- 
dered to let go, the witness declared, 
the negro stepped back and started 
to shoot, but that he shot quickly in 
self-defense. 

“I was acquitted, the court being 
unanimous that the shooting was un- 
avoidable,” Cochran declared. 

At this point the committee re- 
cessed until 2 p. m. 

The hanging of two American sol- 
ditrs at Is-Sur-Tille, France, in 1919, 
was described today by F. B. Fitch, of 
Lansing, Mich. He said in answer 
to questions thaf since the war he had 
served 14 months in the Georgia pen- 
re for the theft of an automo- 

ile 

Fitch was unable to say whether 
t' men hanged had been tried by 
court- martial.
