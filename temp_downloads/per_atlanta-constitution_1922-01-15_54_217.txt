Hamilton, Ala., January 14.—¥ol- 
lowing the declaration of a mistrial 
in the case of Sergeant Kobert Lan- 
easter, Alabama national guard, on a 
charge of murder growing out of the 
lynching of W. M. Baird, coal miner, 
a year ago, late today, the cases of 
éight other gnardsmen, also charged 
with murder in the same case, were 
continued until the regular term of the 
Marion county circuit court, which 
begins the fourth Monday in April. 
Bond for the accused soldiers was 
— by Judge A. E. Gamble at $2,500 


ch. 

Horace C. Wilkinson, speeial prose- 
eutor, admitted that Lancaster was 
entitled to bond, in view of the fact 
that his case has twice resulted in a 
mistrial, but resisted the release of 
the other guardsmen on bail. When 
his obijection- was ovegruled he re- 
served the rizht to appeal to the su- 
preme court for a writ of prohibition 
to prevent the release of the defend- 
ants.

hours’ deliberation. ‘This is the taird 
time he has faced a Marion county 
jury in connection wifb the Baird

mistrial, and the second trial was 
continued. gee 

When the order declaring a mistrial 
was entered, the youthful soldier 
smiled and rubbed his hands, his bride, 
who has been by his side throughout 
the trial, patted him on the arm, and 
his aged father grasped him by the 
hand. Lancaster is a member of 
company M, and his home is at Tusca- 
loosa. He, with the other accused 
ruardsmen, were on strike duty when, 
Baird was taken from the Walker 
county jail at Jasper and shot to 
death. Baird, a striking miner, -was 
charged with killing a member of

When the appropriation bill comes

he would make an effort to have the

ful if they will go beyond the esti- 
mates of the budget bureau.

GASOLINE TAX BRINGS 
$182,444.97 10 STATE 


Gasoline tax returns for the past 
quartertotaled $152,444.07, according 
to reports to W.A. Wright, comp- 
troller general of Georgia, it was au- 
nounced Saturday. Several small deal- 
ers were still to be heard from. Gen- 
eral Wright stated that he theught the 
quarter would yield about $190,000. 

The tax act, fostered by Governor 
Hardwick for ‘bringing adaitional rev- 
enue to the state, was passed at the 
last session of the general assembly. 
General Wright states that the reve- 
nne from the tax should amount to 
more than $1,000,000 a year. 

“Although the returns for the 
last quarter would indicate that t&e 
yearly revenue would not exceed the 
original estimate of $800,000, it mu 
be taken into consideration that dur- 
ing the summer the returns will be 
much heavier,” General Wright said. 
“IT believe that for the summer quar- 
ters we will get about $300.000 each.” 

The largest returns-made for the 
last quarter came from the Standard 
Oil. Company in Georgia which sub- 
mitted a report Of all ‘oil’ and’ gas 
shipped.in and out of the state. The 
check sent by the Standard Oi] com- 
pany was for $70.580.71, indicating

ANONYMOUS NOTE 
LEADS TO FINDING 
OF SLAIN WOMAN 


C,, January 14.—After 
receiving instructions in an unsigned 
note, a deputy sheriff early today 
found the body of Mrs. Miles Pearsall 
in the backyard of her home, five 
miles east of this city, it was learned 
tonight. The woman was shot through 


Wilson, N. 


Iceted, it was said, if it was decided to 
carry out the formal nayl ceremony 
of farewell:to the ships that are w/) 
be destroyed. The oldest of the 
second line battleships is the Ken- 
tucky, first commissioned May 15, 
1900, and which went out of commis- 
sicn May 29, 1920, after twenty 
years and fourteen days of continu- 
ous active service in the navy. If 
the ceremonial sinking is carried out, 
it seems likely that the Kentucky 
would be the ship desi¢nated to receive 
these hono*s, intended to represent 
the pride of the navy, and the Amer- 
icar people in the work that has been 
done through the years by all of the 
old battleships that now are to be de- 
stroyed. 

It would be the purpose of the navy 
to make this ceremonial sinking as 
impressive as possible. Probably the 
ship would be kept intact, painted and 
her brass work polished for the last 
time and put to sea on her last trip 
under her own power. At the select- 
-d point, she wou'd be dressed from 
stem to stern with flying flags and} 
with her battle emblems flying from 
her masthead, her seacocks would he 
onened and as she sank the fleet would 
fire three salvos and the national sa- 
lute of 21 guns in honor of the passing 
of a loyal comrade. : 

Shantung. Problem Moves. 

The Shantung negotiations took 
another step forward today, while all 
of the other activities of the arms 
conference were ata standstill. 

Meeting for the twenty-sixth time 
since they began their separate con- 
versations, the Japanese and Chinese 
agreed on some of the preliminary 
moves looking to complete restoration 
of Kiao Chow territory to China. 

At the same time there was appar- 
ent in some quarters a mounting hope 
that the question of the Shantung 
‘railroad, thé only point on which -the 
two delegations have found themselves 
completely deadlocked, would be set- 
tled soon. on the basis of American 
and British “compromise suggestions,

‘| 1922; Hardwick, 


Macon, Ga., January 14—(Special.) 
Dr. R. Miiis, a local chiropodist, 
reported to the sherifi's office today 
that he had been iured to an isolated 
spot on the Columuvus road, late last 
night, where he was brutally beaten 
by masked men. 

A young woman, said to be employ- 
ed as a manicurist in a local barber 
shop, and a friend of Dr. Mills, receiv- 
ed a threatening letter, warning her 
to leave the eity. 

The letter wag turned over to the 
sheriff, who is making an investiga- 
tion: It is admitted the letter has 
a bearing’ on the assault that is al- 
lezved to have been made on Dr. Millis 
last night. 

Dr. Mills claims heweceived a tele- 
phone call from a person who claimed 
to be in need of his professional serv- 
ica, he being informed an automobile 
would be sent for him. The machine 
carried him out the Columbus road 
a distance of six miles, where’it met 
another car. Several masked men got 
out of the other car, he said, dragged 
him from his machine and beat him. 
one striking him over the head with 
the butt of a pistol. 

Dr. Mil'’s is well known here. He 
was’ formerly proprietor of the Demp- 
sey Hotel barber shop, but about two 
yéars ago opened offices in the Bihb 
building for the practice of chiropody.

HOW BIG MARKET STRUCTURE veiti. LOUK WHEN COMPLETED. 


Construction of a $300,000 market 
building at Ivy street and Auburn 
avenne will begin about March 15, ac 
cording to announcement made Satur- 
day by the Market Engineering and 
Development Company of Atlanta, 
with offices at 1606-1607. Candler 
building. HKobert & Co., architects, 
who have prepared the plans, declare 
that when the building is completed it 
will represent the last word in modern 
and sanitary construction. .The com- 
pleted plans call for accommodations 
wri aataaae 40 and 50 retail food spe- 
clalists. 


Control of the property was obtained 
through the Adair Realty company. It 
embraces the entire old Healey home 
site, and the completion of the market 
is expected to mark an important real 
estate development of that entire sec- 
tion, and furnish a new and attractive 
addition to the downtown business sec- 
tion. 


Demand for Space. 


The Atlanta market will follow the 
general plan of similar structures now 
in succossful operation in a number 
of northern and western cities, Nota- 
bly in Cleveland, Ohio, and Los An- 
geles these markets have proved tre- 
mendously popular with retailers and 
shoppers alike, and indicationis are 
that it will be similarly greeted in At- 
lanta. There has already been a con- 
siderable demand for space in_ the 
building here, although the actual 


plans were only conipleted this week. 
The market plan contemplates, the 
furnishing of a compact shopping dis- 
trict all under one roof, where the pur- 
chaser may buy foodstuffs, kept and 
displayed under the most modern sani- 
tary conditions with every convenience 
provided for satisfactory shopping. 
Each one of the 40 or 50 sheps 
handles a specialty. For. instance, 
there will be shops for fresh meats, 
for fresh vegetables, for dairy prod- 
u¢ts, for fish and sea food, for  oates 
and eggs, for coffees and téas, for 
cheeses and delicatessen, for es and 
candies, in short for everyth that 


is not staple. 
Pre Every Comfort. 

The building is arranged to vide 
every comfort and convenience for pat- 
rons, several thousands being accom- 
modated at one time in-the vast struc- 
ture. In the basement of the building 
will be a complete refrigerating plant 
connecting with the show cases and 
the private refrigerators of each booth. 

Everything offered for sale in the 
market will be under glass, while an 
attractive floor of concrete and marble 
and the finish of each beoth in white 
vitriolite and nickel insures clean- 
liness all the time. 

Attractive offices enclosed in glass 
will permit retailer and customer te 
transact business without interfering 
with the activity of the various shops. 

The second floor will be a balcony.

Civic Organizations and 
Private Citizens Unite} 
in Call for Increase in 


Policemen. 


With civic ‘organizations and pri- 
vate citizens* backing . the proposal 


majority of the city fathers in favor 


of carrying it into effect, is ex- 
pected that council Monday afternoon 
wil] rush through the recommendation | 
finance commitee calling for 
the addition of fifty policemen te the 
present foree. 

That this measure will be the most 
important to be considered during the 
meeting is universally conceded, for 
sentiment for the fmmediate enlarge- | 
ment of the force in order te check 
the recent unparalleled increase in 
erime, it is declared, is 100 per cent 


strong. 2 
Funds Included. 

The finance committee in making 
the city’s budget several days ago 
included funds to take care of the in- 
crease in police ‘pay rolls incident to 
the merease, and its action called forth 
numerous ‘expressions of approval 
from civic organizations and private 
citizens. : 

Among the organizations deciaring 
in favor of immediately putting the 
increase into effect are the church co- 
operative committee, the Lions, the 
Kotarians and the Kiwanis, while in- 
dividuals indorsing it are without 
number. 

The organizations calling for the 
increase have without exception drawn 
attention to the urgent need of more 
policemen to meet the present emer- 
gency, and haste in securing the en- 
la force was stressed. 

The crime situation here showed its 
first signs of abating late last week, 
when there was a perceptible shrink- 
age in the number of crimes of ali 
kinds.

Secretary of War Weeks is. ha 
t contract prepared under which 
Jord will take over the government 
1itrate plant at Muscie Shoals. Weeks 
vill submit the proposal to a 
‘or approval. The understanding is 
that neither Weeks nor Secretary of 
Commerce - Hoover is enthusiastic. 
about the Ford, proposal, aithough it 


is the only comprehensive plan put | 


forward as yet, and the best proposi- 
tion made to the government, 


Hot Fight Foreseen. 


That the contract will be riddled } la 


by congress is the expectation of both 
Weeks and Hoover. The enemies 
Ford made when he gave what sup- 
port he could to former President 
Wilson, the new enemies made through 
the Newberry fight and the legisia- 
tors who are opposed to any associa- 
tion of government projects with pri- 
vate industry will launch their fire 
on the’ contract. 

All of this, of course, will be aug- 
mented by a terrific fight on the part 
of the fertilizer manufacturers’ or- 
ganization, that fight having already 
opened. 

On the other hand, various organi- 
gations of farmers are lining up be- 
hind Ford’s proposal. Ford has prom- 
ised to mahufacture fertilizer and sel! 
at a price to yield not more than & 
per cent on the investment in the 
property. That may mean cheaper 
fertilizer, and at least will mean a 
more abundant supply of this farm 
necessity. So the farmers will give 
Ford as much support as is ~ossible. 


Ford Lies Low. 
In additivn to this support, the leg- 
islators from the Mississippi valley 
will do what: they can to have the 
‘ord proposal indorsed in such form 
as Ford will approve. Ford has 
promised also that out of the Muscie 
Shoals experiment will grow a new 


valley. 

As in the Newberry case, Ford has 
retired from the scene of hostilities 
to permit congress te do what it will. 
The only suggestion that came from 
him is that “money is being spent” 
to prevent a contract being made be- 
tween the governinent and him. 

So there is always something to 
keep the interest up, even though the} 
arms parley has lost its front page 
position. 


FORD EXASPERATED 
BY DELAYS, 
Washington, January 14.—Henr 
Ford in a statement tonight dec 
that Secretary Weeks was appa if 
delaying settlement of the Musee 
Shoals proposition and that “the ferti- 
lizer trust, the power and chemical in- 
terests of Wall street, the money 
brokers and other interests that fear 
to have Muscle Shoals developed along 
lines that will serve all the peop'e 
most, are deluging Weeks and congress 
with literature that grossly misrepre- 
sents the facts. 
“This is not a political matter,” he 
added, “to be jockied and juggled 
about. Why doesn’t Secretary Weeks 
take it or leave it, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as he 
would.a private busirfess matter? I 
mean that now, after six months he is 
still asking what appear to me as 
irrelevant questions and delaying set- 
tlement of this matter. We didn’t 
want Muscle Shoals for selfish pur- 
poses in the first place; hanged if we 
care Very much whether or not we get 
it now. We didn’t make the* govern- 
ment a selfish business proposition—it 
was an industrial philanthropy which 
we offered—an offer based on a de- 
sire for. great publie service. 
Asking Nothing. 

“A subsidy means getting something 
from the government for nothing. 
We're not asking the government for 
a nickel—instead. we're giving the 
government an offer unprecedented 
for its generosity. If the fertilizer 
men think this offer means a subsidy 
why don’t they go and talk to Major 
General Beach, chief of the army 
engineers. 

“Say, those fellows would climb the 
Washington monument rather than 
get the army chief's figures.” 

Discussing charges that he could 
not make fertilizer at Muscle Shoals 
on a profitable commercial basis, Mr. 
Ford declared that Thomas Edison 
says we “oan.” 

“I’m not a chemist.” he added. “but 
Edison has been down there and knows 
every detai) of this proposition. He 
is working’ on this thing right now 
in his laboratories at East Orange. 
He says that with Muscle Shoals we 
can give the American people a better 
fertilizer at a much lower price than 
they have had before. :

. The Federal Land bank at Columbia, 
operating in the states of North Car- 
colina, Georgia and Florida, has closed 
loans since organization to December 
31. in the amount of $8,193,935. Com- 
missioner Lever said it was not until 
February 28 last year that the su- 
preme court handed down its decision 
upholding in every particular the con- 
stitutionality of the act, and as soon 
thereafter as possible an issue of bonds 
in the amount of $40.000,000,was of- 
fered to the public and loaning — 
tions were again begun about June 


st. 

A bill by Senator Harris introduced 
several months ago provided for the 
purchase of $200,000. of farm lean 
bonds by the secretary of the treas- 
ury, and similar legislation for pur- 
chasing that amount. of farm loan 
bonds by the War § “Finance 
corporation passed the senate. 
but was defeated in the house. 
Senator Harris said he would contin- 
ue his efforts to get further funds for 
increasing the loans. He was chair- 
mean of the committee from the agricul- 
tural bloe which recently called on the 
farm loan board.

He will then sail into certain ad-

Wilson Message 
Optimistic Over: 
Party Prospects 


Nashville, Tenn., January 14.— 
“Congratulations on the prospects of 
the party and on the choice of that 
fine ‘Tennessee democrat, Cordell Hull, 
as-the head of .the national com- 
mittee,” are contained in a letter re- 
ceived today from Woodrow Wilson to 
Clyde Shropshire, former speaker of 
the Tennessee house of representa- 
tives, 

Mr: Shropshire, who was chairman 
of the resolutions committee at the re- 
cent assembly of democrats here upon 
the occasion of a dinner to Mr. Hull 
received the following expression of 
thanks and appreciation from the 
former president for a message sent 
to him’ upon his sixty-fifth birthday: 

“The message sent me on the oc- 
casion of my birthday by the demo- 
cratic executive committee of Tennes- 
see and other democrats from every 
county in the state gave me genuine 
pleasure. 

“I hope you will have some oppor- 
tunity to express to all of them my 
deep appreciation as well as my con- 
gratulations on the prospects of the 

rty and on the choice of that fine 

ennessee democrat, Cordell Hull, as 
he head of the national committee. 

“It is delightful to have such as- 
surances of confidence and support as 
the message brought me. 

“Sincerely yours, 
“WOODROW WILSON.”

“We have never needed Muscle

The decision of the court furnished - 


B. Miller, who was the secretary 
of tne national committee, 
~ As the secretary is the active ex- 
ecutive officer, the fight in ity in- 
volves the control of the committee, 
it is\anm epen secrét that there wae 
not tke must complete policy harmony 
het ween tary Miller and the pres- 
ent chairman. re wus. however, 
absolute ‘harmony between Miller and 
Will.H. Hays, who was chairman un 
til last summer. 
Two men are being advanced for the 
secretaryship. One is W. E. Halley, 
secretary of the Ohio state senate, who 
was campaign manaser for Daugherty 
when he was a candidate for the nom- 
ination to the United States senate, 
and pre-campaign manager for Har. 
ding. Naturally, he will be backed to 
the limit by the president and his at- 
torney-getferal. 


Adams’ Candidate. 


The other man is George Lockwood, 
ef Muncie, Ind., editor of ‘The Nation- 
al Republican, the party organ, Mr. 
kwood has the backing of Chair- 
man Adams. ° 

None can now tell how the national 
committee will decide, but the betting 
is on Mr.. Halley. The friends of Mr. 
Lockwood fear that the administra- 
tion will have toe much power for 
them. The understanding is that they 
resent keenly the control that Attor- 
ney-General Daugherty appears to 
have in the matter of appointments to 
big jobs. They feel that the president ' 
has made too many “personal” appoint-. 
ments and has disregarded too much 
the advice of those whe are charged 
with building up the party organiza- 
tion. Some express the opinion that 
a victory for Mr. Halley will mean the 
resignation of Chairman Adama. 

B'aming Committee. 

Mr. Daugherty and his friends. on 
the other hand, are said to be disap- 
pointed with Chairman Adams and 
blame the committee for permittin 
the party to fall into a-.condition o 
unpopularity in the country, partly 
exemplified in the adverse results at 
the polls last November. They euay 
Mr. Adams is not aggressive enonch. 

The real fact is, however, the. na- 
tionx] committee is being blamed for 
republican administrative and jegisla- 
tive policy. 

The Nevyberry verdict and the active 
perenne of President Harding an 
ringing about the resvit, with the 
known pressure that was brought on 
Poindexter and Willis to force their 
affirmative votes ard other such 
tactica, at both ends of Pennsylvania 
avenne, are responsible for the flood 
tide that is running against the re 
publican party. ’

Rachman 
The Great Pianist 


Has Gone 


Mr. Angus Perkerson, in The ~ 
Atlanta Journal, says: 


“There should be some way’ by 
which you couid take such a con- 
cert home with you and have it-all 
over again, a bit at a time. Try 
Chopin’s “Valse,” for instance, just 
after breakfast; his “Polonaise,” a 
little later on-in the morning, and, 
as the day gave you Strength, go 
on to the Beéthoven sonata. In this 
manner, mulling over it, the excel- 
lence of the program would be 
plainer.”

~ Memorial Continental - hall «is the 
wene of events upon which the future 
of. the vorld war hangs suspended. 
‘The conference on the limitation of 


armament and Far Kastern problems 
is marking an epoch In the world's 
Krom our stately hall the 


the world, and the voice of- destiny 
is the voite of God. It has seemed 


the public sessions of the conference, 
which fave been Leld in our hail, that 
the atmosphere was full of spiritual 
forces; it has seémed as if the power 
of the spirit was at work and that 


The 


raised above the’ Jevel of diplomatic 
muneuvering for material advantage. 
In the beginning it was opened with 
prauyer—-an incident which was in it- 
sti. Mnitsual, as evidenced by the com- 
ment it occasioned in the dispatches 
vi a few. correspondents. 


it convened in an atmosphere still | 


hued with uplifted + thoughts 
nroused by the honors paid... to. aur 
unknown dead, when the memory of 
supreme sacrifices made in a common 
cause, a common struggle tor right- 
eousness and justice, had drawn the 
nations once mere together in_ the 
same spirit in which they had fought 
together in the world war tor liberty 
and civilization. ‘The spirituality of 
those supreme moments when the na- 
tion dedicated itse® once more at the 
bier of 1ts dead to the high ids¢als for 
whici it had given #ts sons, when our 
allies brought their tributes conse- 


inillions of lives which they had given 
—the spirituality of a time like that 


to the conference. 
Power of Spirit. - 

If we believe in the power of the 
spirit at all we must believe in its 
influences now upon the minds of 
the men assembled around the table 
in the great auditorium of Memorial 
Continental hail—a memorial erected 
to the great souls of the nation’s 
founders, the men and women of ’76, 
who also made supreme sacrifices for 
iberty, righteousness and _ justice. 
hus the great nations that won the 
war againct the spirit of war and 
militarism are met together- again to 
win peace, to put the seal of security 
upon the priceless things of the spir- 
it rescued at such cost from the ma- 
terialistic onslaughts of German im- 
perialism. East and west, cbristian 
and non-christian, are working to- 


burdens of humanity and promote mu- 
tual understanding . and goad-will 
among nations—for all that nations 
have to do is to understand one an- 
other, to have due eonsideration for | 
one another’s nteds, -and: the golden 
rule wil be an eecomplished fact. 
The spirit of the conference is work- 
ing in that direction: it is moving 


pence, justice, good-will and a firmer 
fellowship among men. 

England and America are being 
drawn even closer togetifer than ever 
before in the bonds of a mutual un- 
derstanding ande solidarity of inter- 
ests, When one English-speaking na- ; 
tfen leads the way in offering a great 
naval sacrifice on the altar of lim- 
itation of armament, and the other 
said, “I am with you,” the world took 
a long step toward peace; for as long 
as the British empire and the United 
States of America work together in 
a comman cause, the world is safe 
from brute force and aggression. Ani-

Combing Won’t Rid | 
Hair of Dandruff || 

The only sure way to get rid of 


dandruff is to dissolve it, then you de- 
stroy it - entirely. To do this, get 


about four ounces of ordinary liquid | 


arvon; apply it at night when retir- 


ing; use enough to moisten the scalp 


and rub it in gently with the finger | 
| tips. 


Do this tonight, and .by morning, 
most if not all, of your dandruff will 
be gone and three ‘or four more ap- 
plications will completely dissolve and 
entirely destroy every single sign and 
trace of it, no matter how much dan- 
druff you may have. 

You will find, too, that all itching 
and digging, of the scalp wil stop at 
once, and Wour hair will be fluffy, 
lustrous, glossy, silky and soft, and 
look and feel a hundred times better. 

You can get’ liquid arvon at any 
drug store. It is inexpensive and nev- 
er fails to do the work.—(adv.)

Mud Creek

“Mark Hopkins on one end of a

the best kind of a university.” 

This saying of a wise man of anoth-

the splendid news that Charles M. 
Neel, that grand old patriarch of Geor- 
gia education, has deserted his apple 
orcahrd at Cornelia, where he retired 
to rest, and has opened an academy 
where 160 girls and boys of Haber- 
sham county are gettimg the benefit 
of the same kind of a tiniversity which

Mark Hopkins, could make out of a

specify.) Georgia clubwomen, always 
erilisted in behalf of rural education, 
take this opportunity to welcome Mr. 
Neel back to the schoolroom, and most 
cordially to greet Mud Creek academy.

members of the faculties of local uni- 
versities, who have been chosen be- 
cause of their special study ‘along the 
lines on which they are to ‘speak. 

That Atlanta should have this op- 
portuity is due to the vision and in- 
spiration of the educational committee

MRS. J. A. GUINN. 

Club women throughout the 
state, and especially those of the 
Fifth District federation, will feel 
in the announcement of the death 
of Mrs. J. A. Guinn, of Conyers, 
Georgia, a loss to which it will be 
difficult to reconcile themselves. 

Mrs, Guinn, at the time of her 
death, was president of the Civic 
Improvement league of Conyers, of 
which she was a founder, and the 
leader since its organization. She 
was at one time vice president of 
.the Fifth. District federation, when | 
she did extensive organization 
‘work. But it was throngh her 
work in her own community that 
her influence was strongest, ‘and 
in its results even more far reach- 
ing than in the larger office. 

Her most conspicuous achieve- 
| ment was the inauguration, and 
, successful direction, for four years, 
of the annual Rockdale County 
fair, an enterprise conducted on 
the same lines as is: the average 
county fair conducted by men, but 
in many details with superior judg- 
ment and success. A descrption 
of Rockdale County’s fair of 19 
appeared on ‘The Constitution's 
club page in October, and the 
unique achievement it recorded has 
been copied in many parts of the 
country and used by women speak- 
ers in many types of organizations 
as an example of the outstanding 
constructive work of women. 

While Mrs. Guinn, in the man- 
agement of the Rockdale fair, was 
each year given the loyal and intel- 
ligent co-operation of other women 

of her community,’ 5s women are 
foremost in ty Be rs. Guinn the 
credit for their inspiration, their 
direction and their encouragement. 

Of equal value to her eommunity 
and county was her edycational 
work. Although it was not so pic- 
turesque in its manifestation as 
were-the annual fairs, it was sub- 
stantial, intelligent effort for~ the 
welfare of the youth. of her . gec- 
tion, and she is credited with some 
of the most progressive move- 

ments in the interest of education, 
both in the schools and with dem- 
onstration agents under the de- 
‘partment of agriculture, which has 
sbeen effective in le county. 
- With all her,. strongminded

First Annual Session. 

Fifteen months after the date of 
orgnnization. the grand chapter of 
Georcia he'd its first annual session 
in the hall of Lorraine chapter ‘in 
Tennille. There was a conatifuent 
number of chapters present and the 
erand chapter was opened in ample 
form, Mrs. _ Christie, grand ma- 
tron. presidin 

We rote that’ the first grand nA- 
tron, Marry Cassil. like some of his 
successors, sent circular jetters to all 
the Masonic lod¢*s to arouse interest 
in the order. We are giad that to- 
day we have the full suppgrt and-co- 
ope-ation of Masonry. 

We quote this*excernt from the 
rrand patron’s address: “The oasis in 
the desert’ of life are many and every 
traveler needs assistence in going 
from one to another.” It is our part 
to be ever on the alert and give as- 
sistance. We note that there were 
seven ehanters reported in this first 
annual... There was a total member- 
ship of 399, Electa chapter having 103 
members. ‘ 

We have surely made progress in 
the last twenty years. 

The first annual of Georgia e'osed 
to meet in Fitzgerald May 7. 1903. 


Recent Activities. 

* A letter from the grand matron, 
Mrs. Narey H. Davis, informs us 
that she has heen busy several daye 
with the installation of the officers 
in several chapters in northeast Geéor- 
“ia, She reports the chapters in thriv- 
ing conditio* and ready to enter inte 
the labors of a new vear with zeal and 
enthusiasm. Mrs. Davis hae officially 
visited over a hundred charters in the 
atate and will go to south Georzia for 
a month’s tour of inspection includ 
‘ng several chapters. 


Recently our most worthy grand 
patron, Dr. Alfred McWDaniels, of 
San Antonio, Texas, organized a sub- 
ordinate chapter in Prince Edward’s 
Island, Canada. Truly we are hav- 
ing our order extended to all parts 
of the world. ur order with its 
tenets ws destined to play a great 
part in interpreting the brotherhood 
of man. 

News from the matron of the Ma- 
sonic home in Macon tells us that the 
many gifts and donations of various 
kinds sent from our chapters to the 
children of the home, added much to 
the jov and pleasure of the children 
at thie festive season.

In a letter received from Mrs, Wal-

appreciation of the fact that the Or- 
der of Eastern Star in the state has 
received such constructive recognition 
from The Atlanta Constitution, and 
says it ib greatly a » agg ae in the 
chapters in that section. 

Mrs. Colquitt further says that 
peace and harmony prevail in all the 
ehapters there, and that the arbools of 
instruction, held. in the Cordele and 
Savannah districts, are well attended 
and are sources of much good and in- 
spiration. She. reports 155 active

donations for the Masonic Home fund. 
are growing each day and that many 
supplies have just been purcbased for

: ‘3 In the course of an evening's reading recently, two striking view- 
points Of the capacity, the aptitude of women presented ves. 
 @Qne was an ysis_by, a well-known woman writer, Mary Alden 
@ Hopkins, of the greatest obstacle women must meet who will make a 
> , success in business or the professions; namely, the barrier raised up in 
» {| their cvn minds by a sub-conscious retention of the age-old tradition 
_ of the inferiority of women. \ 348 
ae. The other view was presented by. Frederick J. Haskin, who built 
"~~ upon a statement by Dr. Simon Katzoff, psycho-analyst. .Dr. Katzotf 
|; Stated before a New England board of education that the training of 
> . Women in the most important business of life for women—that of 
_ being wives—is woefully neglected. 
pi. Mr. Haskin agrees with Dr. Katzoff, while dwelling at the same 
-- time on the “tyranny” the American wife exercises in the home. 
mo ‘The American husband, said Mr. Haskin, is the most petticoat- 
' “dominated man on earth. “In the typical American household,” says 
» * Mr. Haskin, “the husband is deprived of a large part of his personal 
_* liberty in the matter of his associations, engagements and habits. His 
* _ wife’s wishes are presented to him, not.in-the form of requests, but of 
' demands. Yet the average American male accepts this situation philos- 
to feminine domination 


bey 


ie ~  ophically. For one thing, he has been trained 
- from early childhood, for the American youth is ruled by his mother 
' far more than by his father, and he is commonly enslaved by his elder 
_ < sisters as well. It seems quite natural to him to have his wife take a 
|, Similar attitude of ownersbip.” 

foe “Doubtless the American attitude is in many ways admirable,” 
“It gives the woman an unusgal opportunity to

| © sealize herself as an individual and develop any abilities she may have 
—~©6=C(wsS «Sor @ woman of good character and intelligence it is an excellent sys- 


“ tem. But the flaw in it is that the American tradition does not demand 
* enough of the woman to justify the large amount of-freedom she is 
ven.” 2 4 . 
a 4 He calls attention then to the years of training required to make ‘a 
_. woman eligible -to practice a profession or take a rea] stand in the 
,» business. 
- “But she to whose mercies the destinies of one man and three or 
. four children are to be trusted requires no training whatever, accord- 
‘s ing to the American custom.” 
Pe The points of both writers are well taken. It is a curious paradox 
that the woman in the home is marvelously independent in that setting, 
* put the woman transplanted to a business setting, is, as a rule, inwardly , 
’ lacking in confidence, even in those cases When she most emphatically 


., asserts her independence. 
When she starts out in business there are barriers in her own mind. 


, he 


In some instances she is able to climb over them, or push them aside— 


'* more frequently, they remain barriers always. 

. “Inferiority,”” as Miss Hopkins says, “is impressed upon women 

from the day they are born. Timidity, docility, anxiety and indecision 

"* are expected of women, and women very largely live up to the reputa- 

tion which has been given them. Whether or not these qualities are 
inherent in their nature is of less importance than that they believe 
them to be. Inferi6rity can be taught to a child. ' 

“Boys who are brought up on “don’ts,” “mustn’ts” and “can’ts” re- 

act to this negative training in the same way girls do. They grow up 

_ with a sense of inferiority to other boys.” 

Conditions will change. Considering the brevity of the years in 
which women have taken part in business, the number who have step 
ped over the barriers of tradition, is much more remarkable than the 
fact that many more are still held back from fullest expression by un- 
necessary fears. 

The idea] situation will be nearer at hand when the womaniin the 

home learns to”perceive through training that tyranny is an outworn 
method of administration; and when the woman in business learns 
through experience and contact that public opinion is not necessarily 

-, infallible, because it has from time immemorial gone without contra-

' That the flapper has invaded China,’ 
or rather, that China has produced ber} 


own, is made evident by the story told 
by Emma Sarepta Yule, in Scribner’s 


for January. 
Chinese traditions are being set 


ps it requires even more courage 
to aside a custom in that land of 
long clinging to a usage, than in our 
faster ing western lands; at any 
rate, when parents objected to their 
daughters taking part in street pa- 
rades, and demonstrations, they were 
pee with this reply, according to Miss 
ule: 

“We are taught by our sages to 
obey our fathers and mothers, but our 
republic is the father and mother of 
four hundred millions. Therefore, we 
should place the interests of our 
greater father and mother above the 
wisheg of our own parents.” Which 
all goes to prove that Kipling might 
have said “women” in place of men, 
in his poem of Bast and West. 

To note the illustrations of, this 
article, “Miss China,” makes oné ¢cal- 
ize that China is indeed awake. There 
are pictures of the biue triangle of 
the Y. M. ©. A., held by keen-looking 
girls, no Oriental lethargy there: of 
better baby shows, with plump yellow 
kids on the most approved of modern 
scales; of co-eds in the Union Medical 
college in Pekin, which was opened 
by the Rockefeller Foundation, where 
Chinese girls are studying to become 
physicians. 

“Miss China made her debut in the 
mammoth student movement in 1919, 
when thousands of students in both 
private and government schools rose 
In protest against the part Japan was 
being permitted to take in the govern- 
ment of China.” !

Speaking of China, Sunset Magazine 
for January mentions the fact that 
two American-born Chinese girls, Miss 
Mary Chin and Miss Lena Chinn, who 
are not related, except by the simiiar- 
ity of their ideals, are both studying 
with the intention of later going to 
Ohina, which they have never seen, 
to become teachers, and to carry to 
the Chinese women the _ western 
schemes for the education of women. 
According to the evidence presented 
by Miss Yule, they had better ‘not

are so variable that the popular idea 
of a certain per cent for different 
items seems impossible, though many 
economists are budgeting in’that way. 
Take the income, $2,600, used in the 
budget published last week, for in- 
stance, that was to apply to three peo- 
ple. Such an income may be that of 
a college professor, a brick mason. a 
plasterer, a secretary, a clerical posi- 
tion, or many others. It does not re- 
quire a great deal of imagination 
to understand that the different 
needs _ an desires of each of 
these families would mean a diffet- 
ent per cent for each outlay, while, 
of course, the income remained the 
same.

a nage than James Branch Ca- 
bell. 
In their Janua 


4 , 1922, number, in 
an article called in General,” 
which really amounts to a contribu- 
tor’s column, “The iewer” says: 

_*‘The contributor’s list of The Re 
viewer is driving its subscribers to 
madness. Vincent Starrett writes 
from Chicago: ‘Ben Ray Radnor,’ is 
of course, James Branch Cabell; but 
ix James Braneh Cabell also ‘Frances 
Newman?’ .The situation is becom- 
ing bewildering and will you not fol- 
low “The Lineagevof Lichfield’ with 
‘Thc Pseudonyms of James Branch 
Cabell? Or is ‘James Branch Ca- 
bell” a pseudonym? Or is he a 
myth—and did he invent himself> 
ese things must be resolved finally 
if The Reviewer is to circulate else- 
where than in a madhouse.’ ” 


Quite Simple, After All. 


The article continues: “The situa- 
tion is really quite simyple, and it is 
the lurid imagination of Mr. Star- 
rett which bewilders him.” 

To those who know Frances New- 
mar. in the flesh, the situation has a 
joyful poignancy, while even the At, 
lantans to whom she is unknown per- 
sonally have been proud to claim her 
as an Atlanta woman, and most of her 
wider circle of readers have felt that 
she was a very fine woman, actually 
ax well as metally. It seems that she 
i7-now having the additional dignity 
thrust upon her of being considered 
a myth! One might even be pleased 
at being mistaken for a “pseudonym” 
under like circumstances. 

Asserts “The Reviewer:” “ ‘Fran- 
ces Newman’ is Miss Frances New. 
man, of Atlanta, Ga., and she has 
written notable literary introductions 
for The Atlanta Constitution. We 
can vouch for her authenticity, for 
she is frequently in Richmond.” 

The entire story of Frances New- 
man’s connection with tnis macazine 
is not without its satire, for it was 
H. ¥.. Mencken, that stimulating. 
arch-hater of the south, or of its leth- 
arzy (and surely a man may be per- 
mitted to abuse his own section of the 
country). who first wrote BEmily 
Clark, editor of The Reviewer, sug- 
vesting that she ask Frances Newman 
for articles. 

James Branch Cabell, who is head 
of the ndvisory board of the maga- 
zine, and who knew Miss Newman 
personally. immediately realized the 


wisdom of the, advice, and what is 


father unusual, took it, with the re 
sult that “The Reviewer” for Au- 
ust 1, 1921, contained in the follow- 


; wy of the Young 

invellectpale,” by I . Benign 

“The Last Island, rge er- 
and “Charlotte, Russe.” by Jo 
Hergesheimer. 

Mr. Oabell then asked Miss New- 
man to contribute a series of articles 
to the October, November and Decem- 
ber numbers, which were to be edited 
by him. 
- Series by Miss Ne ‘ 

The first of this series, “Avoiding 
the Abbey, a Note on Growing Older 
With Compton a yee was pub- 
lished in tober, 1921." “Advice to 
Living Authors,” in which Miss New- 
man begins by mentioning Mr, Andtew 
Lang’s “Letters to Dead Authors.” 
appeared in the November issue, while 
the December number contained “The 
Young Publishers.” Choosing the book 
most in demand during the past year, 
“Main Street.” Miss Newman com- 
mences her brilliant essay by mention- 


ing the astonishing fact that to the 


majority of readers of this exceedingly 
pular book, the name of Harcourt, 
race & Co. as yet remains an un- 
known quantity. :

title of which is “Urbana, Illinois.

year-old schoolboy of Atlanta.” Ru- 
mor has it that Hansell Baugh is ex- 
tremely indignant .at this misstate- 
ment of facts. for has he not since 
then attained his eichteenth birthday, 
and is he not enjoying the dignity of 
being a university freshmen, even 
though he is agfreshman at Emory? 


The life — in the public eye is 


apt to be Mi: 

Tt was through Migs Newman that 
Mr. Baugh’s work was drawn to Mr,

is primarily interested in tke idea of 
a budget. ney 

“A budget means apportioning an 
income to,an expenditure leaving a 
margin for saving, which, of course, 
is investment. The important point is 
the making of a budget by the indi- 
vidual and the earnest effort to fol- 
low it, and more than half the battle 
is wen when the apportionments are 
actually set. : :

dressed, so he will spend more on 
clothes and laundry. Mr. Jones, who 
is a mason, necds fewer well-made 
clothes, but wants porterhouse steaks 
twice a day. Professor Smith also bas 
to pay higher rent than Mr. Jones. as 
he must live in a different community, 
so he certainly can’t spend as much 
for food. Mrs. Smith must necessarily 
watch out for wastes in the kitchen, 
and examine every penny, while. Mrs. 
Jones has perhaps become more oreless 
profligate in her expenditures. Some 
families spend money for books, others 
for beds and tobacco. Some enjoy 
spending a little for gifts, others use 
the same money for recreation. 

“So the practical idea of a per cent 
system is impossible, as is also a par- 
ticular budget for individual groups 
of people. The budget must be made 
to suit the habits of the budget- 
maker, the underlying principle. as 
stated before, is. to live within the in- 
come and a bit under. 

“In the. tentative budcet published 
last Sunday, taxes and telephone 
would come under the head of in- 
surance; beat for house and cooking 
with rent, as would lights. 

Up to the Housekeeper. 

“As to $10 weekly for food, it ought 
certainly to nourish well a family of 
three. Prior to 1914 or rather 1917, 
when prices began to soar,’I fed a 
family of three adults and a child on 
$8 weekly, which included the highest- 
priced milk and many delicacies. Now 
for four adults and an adolescent child 
(who, you will doubtless admit, eats 
more than an adult) I spend $20 week- 
ly for food, have guests in for menls 
several times a week; this includes 
delicacies that are not commensurate 
with a $2,600 income, The United 
States army allows 27 cents daily 
per man in the army; you must know 
that mushrooms and truffles are not 
included in their menu, but that they 
are surely given the freshest and most 
nourishing food. as well as what is 
known as a well-balanced ration. 

“T hope that this will answer Mr. 
Fowkles’ questions, and that it will 
be a help to others towards ‘making 
a budcet.’” 


‘suggested ‘to the mother that children‘s 


Gentralia, 
Wash., is making an Edna KEerber 
success, by manufacturing dresses at | 
the head of a $3,500-a-month com- | 
pany. Mrs. O’Brien modestly began | 
with her own dresses, then she branch- j 
ed out with a small establishment; 
then the needs of a small daughter 


clothes for sale in the stores at that 
time were not so attractive as they 
might be made, with the result that 
Mrs. O’Brien is now building a fac- 
tory, large enough to house 100 work- 
ers, to supply the demands of the 
stores of the western coast. Like Mrs. 
McChesney, Mrs. O’Brier. does her 
own cutting and designing. 


Harper’s for January contains a

Mrs. Margaret ‘Wintringham, of 
Louth, the second woman to take her 
place in parliament, became a can- 
didate for the seat made empty by the 
death of her husband last June. Quite 
a contrast to the brilliant and witty 
Lady Astor is this new independent 
liberal member of the house of com- 
mons, a slow, deliberate, housewife, 
who only consented to run on con- 
dition that she never be required ‘to 
make any speeches, see reporters or 
write articles for election purposes. 


Of interest to women throughout 
the country is the fact that there is 
a new hotel for women.in Washing- 
ton, accommodating 400 guests, sit- 
uated at the corner of North Capitol 
and E streets, just across from the 
Union station, and within a stone’s 
throw of the capitol. A special fea- 
ture of the Grace Dodge hotel is the 
information clerk, whose business ‘it 
is to tell just which senator or rep-~ 
resentative is speaking at the moment, 
and the status of all bills. 


One of the most interesting articles» 


of the month is that by Marjorie Shu- 
ler, in The American Revie of Re- 
views, called “Women as _ Interna-

Teachers’ and Parents’ 


? 


W ork 


Mrs. T. E. Biggs, president of the 
Parent-Teacher Association of Waverly 
‘Hall, Ga., has written an excellent ar- 
ticle for this plage in regard to the 
teachers and the — co-operation 
in the schools. 
. Mrs. Biggs taught for fifteen years, 
~_ is, therefore, in @ position to state 
clearly her knowledge of this feature. 
Her letter is as follows: 

Co-operation Important. 


‘There has never been a time in the 
history ef our state when the co-opera- 


»” tion of the teachers in the schools and 


the pe of our children is more 
vitally important. When'we face vee 
fact that there are today 5,000,000 of 
children out of school for lack of 
school facilities, this one fact is 
enough to make us, as teachers and 
parents, put on our ‘working clothes’ 
_and join our forces to the that all 
our children, and neighbors’ children, 

y have their educational rights. 

herever a need is recognized, 

we must work - courageously, per- 

mga 4 and tirelessly. until we 

that need supplied. There 

- inet be no place in our plans for 

tty selfishness, unworthy motives, 
pride or prejudice. 

“We must have that ‘faith that re- 
moves mountains,’ that ‘love that nev- 
er fafleth,’ and that vision that can 

k way down the vistas of time and 

see the consummation of our hopes for 
potter schools, better equipments and 
a generation of boys and girls ade- 


quately trained to meet the tasks we 
are bequeathing to them. 
Parents 


Responsible. 

“This task of educating our boys 
and girls is one we must not leave 
our teachers to do, We, as ents, 
are wad caper yey responsible for the 

uality of the eaeadion of the children 
our schools. We cannot, if we 
would, escape this respnosibility. 


“Roger W. Babson has said that, 
‘Statistics show that the greatest un- 
developed resources in America are hu- 
man souls, We must see to it that 
this is no: longer true. We must see 
that they ‘grow y fe wisdom and stature 
and in favor with God and man.’ 
What more perfect development could 
we desire? Perchance, someone may 
ask, ‘Must all tiis be done in the 
schoolroom?’ Remember that the ma- 
gprity of children between the ages of 

and 18, spend, the largest part “ 
their day in the schoolroom, and 
think you will need no answer to 4 
question. The school is responsible 
and, to a great extent, for the traini 
of our ehildren in the fundamentals 
of righteousness, as well as in ‘read- 
ing’ ‘riting and ’rithmetic,’ 

“The Parent-Teacher association 
can have a large part in the carrying 
on of this great work. So, as an or- 
ganization, let us lay aside eyery per- 
sonal ambition, eevry difference _ 
opinions, and agree on broad and 
eral principles. Let's put the go iat 
rule into practice in every relation of 
life, and the day will soon eome when 
all our problems will be solved by very 


simnlep rocesses.’

\Methods to Help 


Mrs. F. C. Cole, who is a patron of 
the Lee Street school, has written a 
letter to the Parent-Leacher editor of 
‘Yhe Atlanta Constitution, in Which 
she offers valuable suggestions in re- 
gard to tie 500 children who are out 
of school, or reported by the attend- 
ance ofticer, Her letter follows: 

“Will you allow nie space on yout 
page to make a suggestion? 

“I see that the new attendance off- 
cer -of the public schools states that 
of the large number of children of 
school age who are out of school, the 
most of them are out because they 
baven’t the proper clothing and cannot 
afford to buy the necessary books. 
Why can’t the Parent-Teacher assv- 
giations attend to this matter? To. 
my mind, this is one of the most vital 
works that can be done by any asso- 
ciation. 

“If the names of these children are 


ferent localities in which they are lo- 
cated, I believe the Parent-Teacher as- 
sociations of the different schools 
would gladly see to it thdt all these 
children are properly clothed, furnish- 
ed with books and also given n 
sary medical attention in order that 
they may attend school. Each ane 
could take care of the children belong- 
ing to their particular grade. Those 
schools that do notthave this condition 
to contend with would be only too 
glad and willing to help the other 
schools that have more work of this 
kind than they could attend to. 

“By having the schools attend to the 
children in their renee: dr nes section, 
it will prevent duplication. By this, 
I refer especially to sections of the 
city where regular mission work_ is 
carried on. Those on the ground are, 
of course, in better position to know 
the requirements of their particular 


not any particular.case js already be- 
ing helped by the Associated Charities 
or any church or other charitable or- 
ganization. Of course, in work of this 
kind, unworthy parties frequently get 
aid undeservedly, and thus cause many 
worthy cases to go unaided. 

“The aim of the P.-T. A. in'énter- 
ing into such a city-wide work should 
be to help all children of school age 
(and on the side get in touch with 
some one to take care of the older 
ones, forcing them to support the chil- 
dren where possible, and give them fair 
treatment at home), giving the “child 
proper medical ttention, clothing, 
food when necessary (as it is in many 
cases), and the necessary books, with- 
out embarrassment. to the child, and 
for the self-aggrandizement of no par-’ 
ticular person or association. It should 
be done for the uplifting and the up- 
building of the ¢hildhood of Atlanta. 
The work should be carried on as sys- 
tematically and regularly as the other 
routine work of the schools. 

“If this work is pursuéd by the as- 
sociations in an unostentationus man- 
ner, it will cause the chests collected 
hv the #'fferent ae to be real 
“Hove Chests,” ey have been 
des’enated, and gill help to rive men” 
a child, who othtrwise would go with- 
out an education. a hannier and bright- 
er outlook for the future.”

CIRCUITS OF VICTORY. 
A. Lincoln Lavine, ex-captain in 


the air ‘service, U. S.@&@.,’ and for- 
merly with the’ American Telephone 
and Telegraph company, . nas 
introduced a new and unique method 
a pene the stuty of the great 


‘In the introduction ‘8 reader will 
find very valuable data,“tn which the 
author says: 

Do you remember the Magic mir- 
ror, which was presented by Merlin 
to his king? You gazed into its pol- 
ished depths and lo! you saw, at a 
glance, all plots, treasons. and .inva- 
sions going on about you. Past and 
present could be called up at will— 
the ey a surge of mankinds moved 
in majestic array before your very 
eyes,” « 

Evidently the writer borrowed the 
Mugic mirror to reveal what has hap- 
pened during the past six years! ° 

It seems “but yesterday that this 
great drama, which we ¢all the “world 
war,’ was staged, with its call to. 
arms, its drilling, its shining but- 
tons and —— helmets, and yet— 

And, therefore, to prevent Ameri- 


all a dream,-Captain Lavine has sib- 
stituted for the Magic mirror the 
American telephone, which in both 
yar and peace took an active part 
in every phase of the struggle—from 
the headquarters of the generals to 
the boys in peak at the front. It 
was a special guide with the artil- 
lery, the infantry, the engineering 
corps, the airplane, the submarine— 
it was everywhere and everywhere it 
shared the losses or the victory. 

The work of the.telephone during 
the war will be even now a great sur- 
prise to its numberless readers, for 
it is not the story of the part inyed 
by the telephone, though Fem Ben- 
nett calls it the war’s produest and 
most poetical achievements, “it is the 
history of an Ameriacn family bound 
together by kindred ties of service,” 
composed of 000 men and woiln- 

en—Americans whose hearts filled 
with pure unadulterated patriotism 
did their best. The shining work of the 
signal corpsof the A. BE. F. in France, 
will not tarnish as long as the world 
stands, for it is bistory—it is the 
Magic mirror of the great war. 

“On to Paris!” “Get the south 
‘bank of @he Marne at all costs!” 

What happened? The enemy never 
got there! “They shall not pass!” 
What happened? America! Ameri- 
cans! It was great work! 

But the Secon work that was done 
—the m joyous message was “armi- 
stice.” “Victory!” (Doubleday, Page 
& Co., Garden City.) 


THIS CRIMSON FLOWER. 


This Crim Flower—In Flanders 
Fields. An anger and other verse. 
By C. B. Galbraith. 

Among the attractive little booklets 
that have recently been 2 ublished as 
replies to “In Flanders Field,” none 
has received a warmer appreciation 
than the little booklet by Mr. Gal- 
braith whose white cover is adorned 
with “The Crimson Flower’—the 
‘poppy : 


“This crimson flower shall eveg tell 
Of those who triumphed as they ng 
Who sleep at peace all dreamlessl 
This flower shall fit memento 
For those avhose days were ended well. 
This crintson flower.” 
Mr. Galbraith’s re 
ant Colonel John McCrae’s “In n- 
ders Fields,” has been read by the 
family of the soldier who. wore the 
khaki, and at the literary clubs, and 
at patriotic meetings this poem and 
answer has been among the most at-

and 18 carats fine, says her young 
brother, who, finding it necessary to 
have a change after an attack of fever, 
is carried by Sallie to the Sierra moun-

ends and their adventures begin at 
Bandy’s Flat—an ex-mining town, It 
is a real good mystery story of the

is the leading feature, for Fate se-

Autumn. By Robert Nathaa, who 
has written the story of an old school- 
waster in a New England village—he 
teHs the story with the utmost sim- 
plicity, and the incidents seemingly 
uninteresting are made to move with 
as’ much action as in the: most up-to- 
date, realistic novels. In writing of 
the book, a reader says: “While it is 
not fantastic, there is in the book the. 
quality of fantasy, together “with | 
much more. There is mirth and Ten- 
derness and pity and ‘a feeling for 
beauty both in life and in the words 
which describe life.” 

The title of “Autumn, carries the 
message that this story lies beneath the 
‘commonplace. (Rebert M. McBride 
& Co., New York.) 

Glenwood of Shipbay. By Jobn H., 
Walsh, author of “Cam Clarke,” etc. 
Tom Glenwood—is so different from 
the average hero that he has been 
called the “brand-new sort of hero.” 
He is: one of the real honest, ciever, 
impulsive characters that ugually drift 
along through life; first, success, then 
comes failure donned in its most allur- 
ing attire, and then he is surprised to 
find that he is down and out, But he 
would not give up the game. and ‘ur-

other, wishes to remain anonymous, 
but no one can read her books with- 
out fully appreciating her whimsical 
humor, real wit, and the charming per- 
sonality of the writer as @ woman. 

The story is one for the reader to 
_ firsthand but it is not a story 

tell, for you would make a misser-

story of “Vera,” Eligabeth has also 
drawn the amusing portrait of a very 
“difficult” man. (Doubleday, Page &

Ysaye Is Direct ing 
Orchestra Appearing 
Here.on January 25 


The Cincinnati Symphony orchestra, 
one of the oldest in America and fa- 
mous throughout the country, will 
make its annual appearance in At- 
lanta on January 265, the ‘sixth number 
of the All-Star Concert series. As for 


several years past it will be conducted 
by the great violinist, Bugene Ysaye, 
who has been at its head for a num- 
ber of years. 

The concerts of the Cincinnati Sym- 
phony orchestra have increased stead- 
ily in- popularity since the first visit 
of: the organization, as Atlanta and 
Georgia people have shown added ap 

reciation for symphonic compositions, 
Mr. Yeaye commented last season u 
the easily noticeable wth of dis- 
crimination and appreciation here and 
of the increase in interest shown by 
the audien Outside of the Metro- 
politan orchestra, which is given com- 
paratively: little attention in compari- 
son to the singers, this isthe only full | 
orchestra which pays Atlanta.a visit 
regularly, and concerts of high class 
orchestral music, by an organization 
large enough to do them justice, are 
rare in the south. 

- About 90 musicians make up the old 
Cincinnati organization, many of them 
veterans of more than 20 years. Four® 
of them have been on the rolls since 
the organization of the orchestra 

8 ago. It has become, r. 

Taave says, “one big family,” the play- 
ers as thoro in harmony with one 
another as the members of a long es- 
tablished string quartet. This is one | 
of the factors to which its excellence 
is ascribed.

'. -Schaefer’s hands 


rificed his interest in many other sports to gave his hands and 
kee othér sports, but for years has been forced to ‘content himself 


e as delicate as Hoppe’s, and since he began 


playing billiards as a small boy he has taken care of them. If Schaefer 
could do whatever he wanted to aside from playing billiards, he would 
choose handball as his favorite sport. ‘But he doesn’t dare to. Hitting 
a hard, or even a soft ball, would ruin his hands and keep him out of

the secret of his speed and accuracy

an amateur athlete. His little finger 
is as thick and strong.as an ordi- 
nary man’s thumb. ‘ His palm _ is 
broad and thick, and bunched with 
muscles, His fingers are long. The 
discus never slips from his grip, al- 
though he gets the record distance 
‘with a tremendous whip and gives a 
speeding whirl-to the missile with a 
tug of the fingers. 

Sslien Elliott, who weighed 145 
pounds and put the 16-pound shot 
over 45 feet, spent years developing 
his hands, acquiring bunched muscles 
of thumb and fingers that gave him a 
great “flip” as the shot left his fin-

A TERRIBLE KNOCKOUT 


Tom Carroll, greatest of all pro- 
fessional, weight throwers,’ has a hand 
thaf-measures just six inches across 
the knuckles. As an ordinary big 
man’s hand measures gnly 3 1s2 inches 
it «an be seen that -Carroll has a 
powerful engine to give the final im- 
petus to any weight he throws. 

He tried boxing once, but after 
knocking out a couple of men by drop- 
‘ping his huge paw on their chins he 
gave it up for fear he might kill some- 
one. The first professional heavy- 
weight lie bored was knocked out for 
twenty-four hours. ; 

John L. Sullivan had thick hands, 
wide across the knuckles, and with 
very heavy wrists. Jeffries had thick 
wrists, but his hands were not large 
in proportion to the rest of his 

sique. : 

a Fitzsimmons had very big 
hands and very small feet. He wore 
u No. 6 shoe. There was a peculiar | 
thing about Fitzsimmons’ hands, that 
I have never seen in ‘any other fight- 
er’s mauleys. When his fist was 
closed the knuckles formed a straight 
line. Usually the knuckle of the sec- 
ond finger stands a —— and the 

knuckle nearly as tar. 
Oo When I first noticed this I thought 
Fitzsimmons’ knuckles had been bat- 
tered back by much hitting, although 
this was before Fitz began breaking 
his hands, but he told me they always 
were level. He thought this had some- 
thing to do with his great hitting pow- 
er, as the blows were landed with all 

kles. 
te when he fought Jeffries the 
second time, Fitz broke the first two 
knuckles of his right and drove them

GILMERITES 
SHOW CLASS 


BY ABE NISSENBAUM. 

From the showing that the Atlan- 
ta Prep league teams made during 
the past week, it seems that the fang 
will see some Of the best basketball 
that has ever been played during this 
season. 

All the league games were played 
at the Auditorium and were run off 
in fine style. Although the Boys’ 
High team did not compete in the 
games played Saturday, the Purple 
Hurricane has already met and de- 
feated Rome High and Griffin High. 
The scores which have been ring up 
by the Gilmer Street lads and the de- 
fense which they have ‘shown would 


seem to indicate that they. are the 
dark horse of the league. 

In the games which the Gilmerites 
have played the Hurricane has amass- 
ed. a total of 103 points, while their 
opponents have made only 23 points. 
The team has been coached by Dave 
Johnston, former University of Geor- 
gia star, and also of Boys’ High. 
The team ‘is using the five-man de- 
fense, but the name of the offense is 
not known to the writer: Never- 
theless it can be safely asid that it 
is-a humdinger if it averages 50 
points per: g@me. 

In the game with Rome High. Fri- 
day; Boys’ High brotght out the fact 
that she has quite a few men orf her 
team who will have to be-reckoned 
with before an all-prep team is pick- 
ed. The men ‘of whom the writer is 
speaking are Tom Slate; who was one 
of the stars of the league last year, 
but did not land an all-prep berth, and 
Speer is a mighty 
fine Jong-range shooter and in Fri- 
day’s game he was simply arsenic un- 
der the hasket, the long. boy just 
coudn’t miss. Reggie O'Dwyer, who 
formerly played with Barton High in 
Mobile, but is now playing forward for 
the Purple Hurricane, gave the rail 
birds an exhibition of just how a 
basketball should be handled.  Al- 
though O’Dwyer weighs only about 
145 pounds, he handle. a ball in the 
same order that Alfred Scott, of the 
A. A. C., does.

WINS TRIALS 


Grand Junction, Tenn., January 14. 
Eugene’s Mr. Jim, a setter owned by 
bD. O. D. Stickney, Atlantic City, N. J., 
was declared the amateur field trial 
champion of -America here late today. 
Dr, Stickney handled his own dog. Mr. 
Jim ran a cofisistent, shooting-dog race 
from start to finish, sustaining his 
pace and range and handling three 
bevies without a flaw. His style on 
game was perfect. He was staunch on 
points and absolutely steady to wing 
and shot. 

The stake was run under the Na- 
tional Association of Amateur Field 
Trials clubs. Dr. Stickney’s pointer, 
Sergy, was high dog at the close of 
the heats yesterday, but when Eu- 
gene's Mr, Jim was put down today to 
run with the pointer, Cole’s Dan 
Woolton, owned by A, L. Cole, Ripley, 
Miss., and handled by Mrs. Webster 
| Price, it was soon n that Se 
was out of the race. Cole’s dog ran ‘ip 
poor luck, for the Stickney dog beat 
fhim to the game on every occasion. 
The last brace of the day consistéd 
of the setter, Chester Valley Blue, 
| owned by E. A. Watson. Lynchburg, 
Va., and handled by Dr. Stiekney and 
Ghost, of Joyeuse. owned and handled 
y R. G. Stoner, Courtland, Miss. The 
Ghost was off form, and his owner did 
not run him through the entire heat. 
Chester Valley Blue ran a classy race 
after making a mess of her first bevy, 

Visitors are arriving for the nation-

, 


BY WALTER CAMP. 


New York, January 14.-—At the 
outset of the intercollegiate basket- 
ball season, the University of Penn- 
sylvania is found occupying: a com- 
manding position with bright pros- 


pects for adding another championship}. 


laurel to its crown, having won the 
intercollegiate for three , successive 
times. Penn loses one of its stars this 
season in McNichol, but in Grave it 
bas a foul shooter of excellent, quality. 

No one has been quite able to éx- 
plain why Penn’stands out so promi- 
nently in basketball each year. Las 
year, besides winning the inter- 
collegiate it defeated the New York 
university team, which was considered 
one of the strongest fives in the east, 
Penn suffered only one defeat, inflict- 
ed by Penn State in an extra: period. 


Dartmouth Strong. 


Dartmouth gives promise of offering 
serious opposition this season, The 
team showed well on its Christmas 
trip and Coach Zann hopes it will 
better its last year’s record when it 
finished second in the intercollegiate. 
Cornell is another team that has 
shown play of high quality, greatly 
improved over last year when it played 
brilhantly at times and very in- 
decisively at others. Last season it 
led everything in field goals. Prince-' 
ton is showing better spirit and better 
form after a bad season in 1921, due 
to internal troubles and various up- 
sets, its coach. resigning. 

Basketball’s once proud. figure, 
Columbia, is starting out with only 
average prospects and it is a question 
whether it can pull together a Banpest. 
able team. Yale has shown the least 
promise of.all, having been defeated 


~~ 


all along the line on the Christmas

football. season and the opening of 
ithe track and baseball season. 
Conditioning Value. 


There is a wide difference of opin- 
ion as to its value as a conditioner 
of men. The criticism has been made 
that basketball, instead of improving 
a man’s general condition rather low- 
ers his tone and vitality, owing to 
‘elose and confined air of gymnasiums 
on.which most games are played. 
This contention is not borne out by 
the records. The game has been found 
to. keep the men in good condition 
muscnlarly and to make them quick. 
It has been found to be a distinct 
nid to. football. men in making them 
more proficient in passing and 
handling the ball, 

This in spite of the fact that basket- 
ball and football are of different 
shape. , 

Several fine basketball throwers 
have become stars on the football field 
in throewing the forward pass. 

Injuties in the game are infrequent 
and such as occur are rarely ever of 
a serious character. 

There\has ‘geen some agitation for 
a cha in the rules so as to give 
less value to goals thrown after fouls. 
Advocates of the change make out a 
strong case for it as it has demon- 
strated time and again that one team 
may play the game better, that is. 
it may make’ more successful field 
throws and yet be beaten throngh the 
special expertness of a player on the 
other team in throwing goals after 
fouls. It appears that something 
could be done along this line to im- 


‘prove the equity of the game. ~ 


Modern Catchers Are Far Behind 


BY MACLEAN KENNEDY 


The catchers who were or, are boni- 
fide 300 batsmen in the major leagues 
since 1876.are about as scarce as 
bubbling spring ik the great Sahara 
desert for only two. hold that honor 
—Buck” Ewing and Mike (King) 
Kelly, of the old school. Many years 
have slipped by since these two great 
players were the center of attraction 
ix. big league baseball. The game 
may haye catchers who could.catch a 
better game than either of these stars, 
but, as a power offensively and ¢é- 
fensively, there never stood a cateh- 
er who could compare with these -pow- 
erful players of years ago. 

“Buck” Ewing. played in*the Na- 
tional league for fifteen years or from 
1889 until 1894, and battled in ten 
of them and finished his career in 
the big leagues. with a life’s batting 
average of. .311. . Mike Kelly, .during 
his stay of fifteen years in the big 
show, had_a batting average of .3}4. 


Mike was the greatest drawing card} 


the game ha! days, There were’ 
many rules made for the express Rr 
pose of fojling the tricks that Mike 
introduced into the game, and. many 
o-: these rules are now. contained in 
ou... baseball guides, but, out of Kelly’s 
fertile brain, a pew trick was born.

Ewing Better Catcher. 

“Buck” Ewing was, perhaps, a bet-' 
ter and came within a few points of

him as a batsman; both were great

with. Then there were Charlie Ben- 
nett and the great Bushong, when not

Charlie Bennett wasn’t a poor hit- 
ter by any means, finishing his won- 
derful career in the big show with 
a batting average of 280, but Kelly 
and Ewing were in a class by them- 
‘selves. ey were ball players of 
extraordinary ability and could play 
every position, save that of hurler, 
right up to the required standard. 

Are Rare Animals. 

Yes, the lads who fill that -arduous 
position and can hit over the .275 
mark are as rare as a snow ball inp 
June. One catcher the game contain- 
ed, and he was a left-handed one, eame 
within a few points of being a .300 
man. Jack Clements, catching for 
the Philadelphia Nationals from 1884 
until 1898, was a remarkable catcher 
and after fifteen seasons of big ball 
playing, quit the game with a bat- 
ting average of .205. Some of the 
backstops, of today are heading to- 
wards th® .300 mark. Steve O'Neil, 
of Cleveland, and Wally Schang, for- 
merly of the Boston Red Sox, and now 
with the New York Americans, are 
hitting along at a .300 clip. Sha

Seattle, Wash., January 14.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Football as played by repre- 
sentative teams in the respective sec- 
tions of the United States is pretty 
much on a parity. Statistics on inter- 
sectional games in the last 22 years 
support this statement and in no 
single season has there been more ade 
quate proof of virtual equality of the 
teams than-in the one just closed. In- 
tergectional gridiron combats, too ap- 
parently, have come to stay. 

There were a number of notable 
games in 10921. Chicago defeated 
Princeton, Penn State the University 
of Washington and Georgia ‘Tech, 
Centre downed Harvard and the Uni- 
versity of Arizona, only to fall before 
Texas A. & M., and Washington and 
Jefferson and California played a 
scoreless tie game January 2. 


The 1922 gridiron schedules are re- 
plete with intersectionAl games. Chi- 
cago will meet Princeton arid Univer- 
sity of Georgia, Iowa will play Yale, 
Michigan will meet Vanderbilt and In- 
diana will play West Virginia. Wash- 
ington will bring an eastern team west 
to play in the stadium here and there 
will be the annual east against west 
game at Pasadena again next New 
Year’s day. 


Critics this year have been loath to 
attempt to name a national champion 
eleven. Any selection would be the 
target for a number of broadsides. 
Penn State, Iowa and California, to 
mention a few teams, had great eley- 
ens, but avho is there to say that any 
one was stronger than all the others? 


RECORD 
IS EVEN. 


A complete record of the results ‘of 
games in which Pacific coast or far- 
western elevens have met teams hailing 
from the middle west, the south and 
the east since 1899, backs ap the par- 
ity contention. For convenience sake, 
here Pacific coast elevens will be 
termed western and all others eastern 
teams, 

Since Christmas day, 1899, when 
Glen Warner’s traveling Carlisle In- 
dians came west to San Francisco and 
defeated the University of California 
2 to U, there have been 19 east vs. 
west games in which 26 teams, 11 
— and 15 eastern have partici- 

ted. 

Of the 19 games the east has won 
10 and the west 7,.and 2 have resulted 
in a tie. The east has scored v74 
and the west 152 points. These sta- 
tistics, however, must .be amplified 
to show how nearly equal in caliber 
the average have been. the contesting 
elevens. 


In the course of the intersectional: 


battles teams from eleven eastern 
states have met teams from five wes- 
tern states. The east has been rep- 
resented by Carlisle, Michigan, St. 
Louis university, Michigan Agzies, 
Syracuse, Brown, Nebraska, Pennsyl- 
vania, Harvard, Dartmouth, Ohio 
State, Penn State, Centre and Wash- 
ington and Jefferson. 


WESTERN 
DEFENDERS. 


Uphelding the honor of the west on} 


the gridiron have been the state uni- 
versities of Washington, Oregon, Cali- 
fornia, Montana and Arizona and 
Stanford, Washington State college, 
Oregon Aggies and Occidental college. 

In the recapitulation. of intersec- 
tional games which accompanies this 
story teams of the Multnomah Ama- 
teur Athletic club, Portland, Ore.. and 
the ‘Mare Island (Cal.) and Great 


Lakes (TiJ.) naval training stations'| ; 


are included, for the players were all 
college men. 

On the face of them the statistics 
show the east superior. to the west in 
ae ratio of 10-¢t i

defeated in 1920’by Dartmouth and 
| December 3 last by Penn State. The 
Stanford team which Michigan de- 
feated 49 to 0 at Pasadena in 1902 
was in reality an eleven of “all-stars” 
not in the best of conditien. 

. On the other hand the western eley- 
ens have played at home or a rela- 
tively short distance away while the 
invaders have traveled from 2,000 to 
3,000 miles. But in two instances 
western teams went east and both 
won, the Oregon Aggies from the 
Michigan Aggies at East Lansing in 
}1915 and Wushington State from Ne- 
braska at Lincoln in 1920. 

Since January 1, 1917, when the 
first east vs, west game was played 
at Pasadena as a Tournament of Roses 
attraction the west has won three 
games, the east two and one, the 
recent California-Washingtno and Jef- 
ferson game, resulted in a scoreless 
tie. 

It is interesting to note that Pacific 
coast elevens have gone as far west 
to play football as any Atlantic sea- 
board team. The University of Ore- 
gon has defeated the University of 
Hawaii at Honolulu two suc ve 
years, Thus American football in 
1920 ‘and 1921 was played from Maine 
to the Hawaiian Isiands, 

No story on intersectional games 
would be complete without mention of 
some of the coaches. \Gilmour Dobie

EUROPE WILL 
BACK FIGHT 


New York, January 14.—(By the 
Associated Press.)—Ring followers 
conceding with Texas Rickard ‘that 


another match in America between 
Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier 
would be a financial fizzle, were in- 
clined to believe today that such a 
scrimmage might be staged abroad 
with fair profit, 

' There have been reports from time 
to time that the Frenchman again 
might like to face Dempsey and this 
is confirmed by dispatches from Car- 


tory over Cook, the Australian heavy - 
weight. Dempsey’s manager said the 
champion was ready to defend his 
title any time the guarantees were 
posted. 

Abroad Carpentier is still the super- 
fighter of Europe, having promptly 
disposed of his English, French and 
colonial heavyweight opponents. While 
his decisive defeat by 
as something of a surprise to Europe, 
he has declared that if he were to 
meet the American again he would 
box at long range and seek to wear 
down his heavier opponent to a point 
where a knockout .could be landed 
without peril of retaliation in a toe-to- 
toe mix-up 

Many of his supporters abroad are 
inclined to believe that such a ring 
campaign might succeed, 


Smaller Receipts. 


Owing to financial 
abroad, attendance and gate recelpts 
would not likely approach those in 
Jersey city. Dempsey, however, has 
no worthy opponent for a bout next 
summer and might be willing to box 
abroad for considerably less than he 
received from Rickard for facing Car- 
pentier. 

There are plenty of precedents for 
giving Carpentier a return match, 

Jim Jeffries, after winning the 
heavyweight title from Bob Fitzsim- 
mons in eleven rounds, gave him a 
second chance and knocked out “Ruby 
Robert” in eight rounds. 

Jim Corbett lost twice to Jeffries, 
once in twenty-three rounds and later 


in ten, 

John L. Sullivan fought Charley 
Mitchell twice. 

Stanley Ketchel met Bill Papke 
three times, winning a decision, being 
knocked out and then returning the 
knockout in the third battle. 

Jimmy Britt and Battling Nelson 


tal of fifty-eight rounds, 

Young Corbett after knocking out 
the terrible Te McGovern, gave 
the Brooklyn battler a second oppor- 
tunity and repeated just as decisively 
—and the list might be continued in- 
definitely, if all weight classes were 
included.

single foul called on him. No per- 
sonal fouls, and not even a fowl on

the ball, double dribble, ete. When

keep within the strictest limits of 
the rules, then you might say that 

he is pretty good. ‘ 
Bass played a nice game for the 
home team and led the field in points

# free tries at the basket, made six of 
them good, which is some better than 

he has been doing. 
For Auburn, Dudley and Hahn 
ayed the most deserving game. Dud-

point on was anybodies, that is, if you 
could have neglected what had already 
been scored. Askew went in~ for 
Bass, Singleton for Scott, Oliver for 
Graves and Hartney for Sullivan. The

stunts in this half, falling over each

A. C. Reserves Win. 


The Tech freshmen and the A, A. C. 
Reserves played a pretty game of bas- 
ketball at the Auditorium last night. 
The game was played before the A. 
A. €.-Auburn affair. Both teams were 
“putting out” and interest never lag- 
eed fora moment. There was mt the 
finish to the play that comes with a 
whole lot of playing, but there was 
the never-quit spirit and\a whole lot 
of pep on both sides, which more 
than compensated for what each team 
lacked in a basketball way. ©The 


the A. A. C. reserves. 

Hahn, for the A. A. C. Reserves, is 
some baby when it comes to putting 
them through the loops. He made 
16 of his team’s 22 points. Hahn, a 
brother of the Hahn on. the Auburn 
tenm this year, played basketball him- 
self at Auburn for three years. Last 
vear he was considered one of the best 
forwards in the south and Auburn 
won many a game through the ability. 
of Hub to locate the basket. They 
cold stop everybody but .-Hahn. 

For the Tech freshies, Martin prob- 
ably played the best game, though 
Meacham and Banks played consist:

to a pretty bad start, but that should 
not be discouraging, for they have 
some good material on the squad.: The

Georgia Bulldogs Win Second 
* Game of Season, Beating Furman 


Greenville, S. C., January 14.— 
(Special.)—Georgia defeated Furman 
here tonight in a hair-raising exhibi- 

m tion of basketball. The final score 
wns 32-22. The score up until the 
last part of the last half’was neck and 
meck, with neither team having the 

, 9 wcided advantage. It seems thar 
Georgia's “green” team is going to de- 
velop into ~ formidable machine after 
all. With a victory over Clemson 

wurring them on to greater efforts, 
ae # Georgia boys fought to add the 
Forman scalp. 
..The pass work was all that coyile 
he expected of a team at this time in 
the season. The fellows have learn- 
ed where to find each other on the 
eourts and show a marked improve- 
ment in team work. 

The work of Eddie Rawson was 
the outstanding feature of the night. 
He was the leading scorer for the 

night with 17 points to his credit. 
Not only that, he was all over the 
conrt and like a regular star.

U. S. B. WIN 


BY ROY E. WHITE. 

Tech High and Unfversity school 
won the opening games of the city 
prep basketball league at the City 
Auditorfum court Saturday afternoon 
before one of the largést opening day 
crowds in the history of the league. 


Tech High won over the Marist five 
after an awful battle, the final count 
was Tech High 32, Marist 19. Um- 
versity beat the G. M. A. cadets by a 
31-to-21 count. 

The first game of the afternoon was 
between Tech High and Marist. The 
Tech High team was favored to wih 
by some 30 points, but at the end of 
the first. half the score was: Tech 
High 13, Marist 10. Marist war 
leading up until the last few minutes 
o* pl@y, when the Junior Smithies’ 
five pulled away. by some good passing. 

Richardson Stopped. 

Captain Richardson, of the Tech 
High team, was expected to run away 
with the scoring honors, but Satur- 
day he was almost completely stopped 
when it came’to shooting field goals. 
Captain Bradley, of Marist, had Ri¢h- 
ardson well eovesed all during the 
game, and the Tech High star only 
shot a total of five field goals. It 
cau be said, however, that Captain 
Richardson sent over the foul goal 
shooting record of the’ prep league. He 
shot 14 foul shots_in fourteen at- 
tempts which is some record itse’f. 
The prep league record of foul goals 
iz held by Laird, of University, who 
shot 1Z in succession, in 1918, Rich- 
ardson has an excellent chance : to 
brenk that record. 

The team work of the Tech High 
team was a bit off. During the first 
half they were a bit overconfident, 
and as a result did not play as con- 
sistently as in the last half. The 
Tech Hich forwards tried too many 
long shots in the first half. In the 
second half Tech Higch played a much 
better brand of basketball. Their 
rassing in the latter half was. good. 
The forwards exercised care with the 
shots and made the majority of them 
count. 

Marist. Looked Good. 


The Marist tenm, thoncht by many 
to be the weakest team in the Jeague, 
s’rung a surprise. They held the 
Tech High team almogt at will in the 
first ha'f, but«were unable to keep up 
the work in the second. Captain 
Bradley, of the Marist team, deserves 
much praise for his guarding in the 
eame. He kept the Tech High for- 
wards from shootine at close range 
and spoiled many of the loye shots. 
The team work exhibited by the 
Marist five was good, (They. kept an 
eve on the ball at all times. and took 
ndvantave of every vppertnnitv af- 
forded them. Bailey, Holland and 
Simmons divided the scoring of the 
Marist team hetween them. Dovle, 
who was substituted for Paver, play- 
ed a good game at forward during the 
entire Inst balf.

G. M. A.-University. 


The G. M. A.-University game was 
a fast game and a complete surprise 
to the spectators, for the cadet team 
find been practicing only a few weeks, 
Both teams used the five-man defense 
system and both used it to an ad- 
vantage. University probably used 
the system better than the cadet team, 
dune to more practice and experience. 
The first half ended with a 14-to-7 
a with University on the long 
end. 

Actine Captain Laird and Angley, 
of the University team, shot all the 
points for their mates. They were 
the only University players that man- 
aged to break throuch the G. M. A, 
defense enouch to get a good shot. 
Both these men tried many long shots, 
but all were of no avail. 


Cadets Crippled. 

Coach Burbage’s story of a badly 
crippled team was clearly proven, for 
there are only two men on the team 
who ean shoot goals. These men 
are Fair, at forward, and King, at 
center, King is almost a team with- 
in himself, for his playing in the 
game was the best on the floor.. His 
dribbligg was one of the features of 
the afternoon. He is credited with 
shooting the first field’ goal between 
University and G. M. A., his goal 
coming soon after the tip-off. King 
had the advantaze over Freeman in 
the tip-offs, getting the majority dur- 
int the afternoon. Fair, at forward, 
plaved a consistent game throughout.

t 


Mainly because outside it is one of 
the coldest nights Atlanta has expe- 
rienced this winter, and because it is 
likely to be just as cold when your 
eyes dwell on these lines Sunday morn- 
ing, the thoughts of the writer are 
paving to baseball, the catfish at 
Bay di. Louis, the peanuts and pop 
uies at Ponce de Leon. , 

We are wondering what the pros- 
pects will be and, in order that you 
may ponder this question with us, a 
list of players already sighed by the 
Dutchman and his boss, R. J. Spilier, 
has been compiled for your perusal. 

Because this is the season when we 
are likely to catch anything, colds, of 
course, ruling favorites in the race. let 
ws begin with the catchers. Bill Rari- 
den, “Butch” Sebmidt and Roy. Mc 
Clellan are the. candidates, with the 
chances very good that (bipman, who 
had a tryout last spring at the bay, 
will also return, | 

Mr. Raridegp, was the. well-known 
captain of the Crackers last ‘summer. 
He will be given the chance this sea- 
son of becoming just as-well known, 
but with bis captain's toga considera- 
bly spoiled. In other words, he is 
slated to hatid over this job to some 
other player. Giving up this place 
will probably add to Bill's value as a 
eatcher in the Southern league, pro- 
vided, of course, he can be induced to) 
stick around in this society after bis 
hing of many years in the majors. 

About these other. catchers: Me- 
Mellan showed much class last spring. 
Fle led the camp in batting, but the 
Dutchman felt the youngster ‘needed 
more polish. He prebably took on 
some during the camviign, and will 
nrove formidable this time. Schmidt's 
work throughout the season was good. 
and Chipman will give them all a good 
run for their money. 

Dutch Bernsen wil) be the Atlanta 
first sacker unless he breaks an arm / 
or something else ‘before the grind 
starts. Arthur Ritter should prove a 
star at the kevstone. Jack Martin. 
Roy Fllam and Freddie Graff will 
have third base an‘4 shortstop to divi“’e 
hetween them. The ontfielders will 
be Se-mmv Mayer, Josenh Guvon and 
“Red” Wineo—three tht ranked near 
the top last season, and plucked for 
birrer honors next summer. 

Sniller probab’v has the sienatures 
of a dozen -bush.lercuers and snn4- 
letters that. will be given every 
charee to show their wares. Now, a!- 
tnvether—what’s the ontlook? . 
BOB MARTIN COMING 
ALONG VERY NICELY. 

Amiericn’s sohtier-fighters, Roper, 
Tunney, Smith and Martin, are coming 
along nicely, thank you. Martin, 
listed last in the names outlined above, 
hay suown More prowise taan any of 
his comrades, and is the hope of ex- 
service men for the heavyweight 
honors. ; 

Tunney, beating old Bat Levinsky to 
a pulp Friday night, is the first to 
earn any kind of a title, except those 
that were given in the A. E. F., but 
the wise ones assert that_Gene’s weight 
would be very much against him in a 
duel with the champien. 

This is unquestionably true. The 
other night, Tunney weighed 171 
pounds, which is more avoirdupois 
than he has been able to muster in 
any previous*encounter. He might be 


| 


he'll add much more poundage before 
all of it begins to assemble around 
his waistline as warning of the ap- 
proach of his career’s close. 

Roper, although his maanger ridi- 
cules the idea, is said to have passed 
his year of greatest effectiveness ih 
ring battling.. Roper gave out much 
promise for a while, has done nothing 
lately that would mark him of “con- 
tending caliber. 

Ray Smith’s star was shooting 
along at a terrific pace for a bit, but 
it, too, appears to have about waned. 
He is still good as a box office at- 
traction, and it will be some years be- 
fore he'll have to hang up his fisticuf- 
fing paraphernalia for lack of business. 

Martin, however, has just started. 

Not that he hasn’t been mighty busy 
since returning from his overseas 
service, but until recent months he was 
steered clear of the big game. Now his 
managers have announced that Bob is 
ready for the real competition. 
_: The nation’s experts in boxing have 
weighed Martin carefully. They be- 
lieve he has the goods. The develop- 
ment of a punch in his left glove has 
taken a long time, but the word at this 
time is that Martin is a .two-fisted 
bruiser, with a kick in both mitts. 

He is not anxious for-a tilt. with. 
Dempsey immediately. There are sev- 
eral other heavies that Martin must 
lick before a match with the champion 
would draw mough to cover expenses. 
But Martin is patient and improves 
every day. 

HARRY FOLEY MARCHING 
RIGHT ON TO GLORY. 


Lovks like they’re going to be un- 
able to stop one southern pugilist be- 
fore he puts in a claim for a serap 
with Mr.Dempsey. We are referring

growing, but it is hardly likely that |}, 


—badly, we are informed. The chal- 
enger was Harry Voley, and he start- 
ed on the rampage. His good work 
won him a eliance to appear in a pre- 
liminary battle’ in New Orleans, -and 
‘it_ was the last time he fought with 
‘the secondary rating. : 

In recent months Foley has become 
the greatest drawing card in the Ures- 
cent City, and the fans in that town 
‘will swear thdt,he can lick anything 
in the country. In the meantime, 
Foley is fighting and saying little about 
it, but we believe he’s going to get in 
mee big leagues before he decides to 
quit. 

BING MILLER IS 
“$50,000 BEAUTY.” 

“An official of the New York Yan- 
kee club,” stated a news dispatch re- 
cently, “declared that the New York 
Americans tried to obtain Joe Vugan. 
by purchase some time ago and of- 
fered $50,000, which was refused. Con- 
nie Mack, Athletics’ manager, is said 
to have insisted on $100,000 as the 
purchase price.” 

That statement proves that Bing 
Miller is worth $50,000 as a ball play- 
er to Connie Mack, and the proof of 
the assertion is easy, since Bing and 
Joe Acosta went to the Mackmen in 
exchange for Dugan, who in turn was 
turned over’ to the Boston Hed Sox. 

Unless the lessons learned in the 
arithmetic Mr. Wentworth sold the 
school trustees at Americus, Ga,, some 


}years ago were far wrong, $100,0UU 


divided by two, leaves $50,000, ‘The 
larger amount was the value placed 
on Dugan -by his boss; Miller and 
Acosta were .the players transferred 
for that staggering sum. 
etc., ete. fe 

When Bing Miller was trying to de- 
stroy the Dutehman’s signboards back 
in 1920—playing at the time for Lit- 
tle Rock—we thought he was worth 
something. We knew scores of At- 
lantans that would have paid Bing to 
stay away from Poncey, but few of us 
picked him as being worth $50,000 to 
any ball club in the world. 

According to all reports, Mr..Mack 
hasn’t a ball club up in Pbiladelphia, 
but the cliances are that if he signs 
many more players of Miller’s stripe 
he will have. before the campaign 
starts. As old Tom Sheehan used to 
say about Bing: “When that fellow 
swings the best thing to do is duck,”’ 
Miller might give the Athletics some 
offensive strength. He'll have to pro- 
vide considerably to justify what 
arithmetic has proven to be a “right 
peart”.sum.of these new American 
dollars. 

BRING ON MACON; 

One of the best basketball teams in 
the southland has straightened its ath- 
letic tangle and can vow quanty as 
amateur. The Macon Y. M. C, 
quintet is the one under discussion. 

Atlantans are curious. to see the 
Bibb county athletes in action. The 
record of the organ:zation’ last year 
was brilliant in every particular and 
has earned the five a-ranking that 
was very near the top. 

The chances are that the Macon 
team is not as powerful as it once 
was. The loss of Charlie Morgan 
would burt any basketball machine, 
but the eourt pastime has a large fol- 
lowing in the Central City, and strong 
teams abound there every season. 

Macon, this year, would be no set- 
up for any outfit. The city. has pro- 
duced some of the south’s greatest 
basketball stars, and there are proba- 
bly other very capable performers car- 
rying. the silks of the Macon “YX” 
this year. 

The Constitution is informea by Al 
A. Doonan, ¢ghairman of the athletic 
committee of the Atlanta Athletic club, 
that everything possible will be done 
to arrange a game with Macon. The 
drawing power of the battle would be 
tremendous and the financial success 
of the venture assured. 

The schedules of the A. A. C. and 
the Macon “Y” look to be filled at 
this time, but perhaps a date could be 
sandwiched in that would prove ac 
ceptable to all parties concerned.

BY EDWARD W. COCHRANE. 

Now that Benny Leonard, light- 
weight champion ot the. worid, and 
sex Rickard, Americas leading box- 
ing promoter, have smoked the pipe 
of peace and Leonard is once nwre 
ready to appear in Madison Square 
garden in jw-round batties in detense 
of the coveted title of the 130-pound 
cass, there are a half<lozen gvod 
fighters clamoring for the first oppor- 
tunity to meett he kingpin of the di- 
vision in a decision eficounter. Two 
of these challengers wiil furnish the 
feature bout of this week's boxing 
wogram in the United States, when 
ohnny Dundee, junior lightweight 
champion, and Charley White clash 
for 12 rounds. 

Dundee always has entertained an 
idea that he weuld eventually gain a 


for 15 sessions. They have met sev- 
eral times and the Scotch-wop, as 
Dundee is called; did not finish a 
very distant second. Since their last 
meeting Dundee has improved as a 
boxer, while this cannot be said of-the 
champion, who has been idle a great 
deal of the time and, therefore, is said 
to be slipping slightly. - Dundee is 
older than Leonard, but the little Ital- 
ian has taken the very best of ¢are of 
himself and has been a constant per- 
former in the hemped circle. 

‘ White’s Opportunity. 

White has been chasing the elusive 
title ever since k'reddy Welsh was at 
the top. Some years ago he met Welsh 
in a 20-round encounter in UColorado 
Springs. It was in the days when 
Welsh was due for a trimming, but 
the slow moving, siow thinking White 
stood flat-footed in the ring and al- 
lowed Welsh to make a monkey of 
him. That was White's real opportu- 
nity, because Welsh lost to Leonard in 
short time later, which was expected. 

Last year White fought Leonard in 
Benton Harbor, Mich., and he gave 
the champion a terrific fight, due. to 
the fact that Leonard had been idle 
and untrained for some time and he 
held White too cheaply. Had Leon- 
ard been in his real fighting form he 
would have won handily. His failure 
to do, so, however, caused White to 
become imbued with the idea that he 
can beat Leonard if they meet again. 

Dundee Should Win. 

Thus the battle in Boston is likely 
to furnish a real challenger for the 
title. If either one wins decisively, 
he will be the recipient immediately 
of an offer from ‘I'ex Rickard to box 
Leonard in New York. The chances 
are, however, that the light-hitting 
Dundee will simply outpoint White, 
who will encounter difficulty trying 
to put over his celebrated left hook on 
the jumping Italian. Duidee is too 
clever to lose to White except by the 
knockout route, and should be able to 
avoid the telegraphic wallop in White's 
fork fist. ; 

While this hattle will attract a lot 
of attention, there are sereval others of 
importance on the card.. Uniess there

Loses Battle, 49 to 20 


Tuscaloosa, Ala., January 14.— 
(Special.)—The largest crowd that 
ever packed itself inte a Tuscaloosa 
gymnasium saw the University of Ala- 


bama ulsed .the invation of the 
Georgia Tech Yellow Jatkets here to- 
night. The final score was 49 to 20. 

Tech’s defeat was gradual. There 
was nothing in the play of the Jackets 
that indicated they were to be beaten. 
As a matter of fact for a goodly por- 
tion of the first half, every offensive 
smash by the local collegians was 
met by one just as fierce from the 
Jackets side of the court. 


The Pace Told. 


But the pace told on the Atlantans 
after a bit. From being one point to 
the rear five minutes after the struggle 
started, the Techsters found them- 
selves at the end of the half thirteen 
puints to the bad. It was the result 
of persistent plugging on the part of 
the Crimson, for the visitors were 
fighters that refused to 
budge an inch unless the maximum 
power of the Tuscaloosa machine was 
directed at them. 

Local followers of the indoor pas- 
time had been informed that the baa- 
ketball players of Georgia-Tegh com-' 
prised something that was as far re- 
moved from their football prowess as 
day from night It took them juat 
abont one minute to realize that the 
locals would be very fortunate to even 
win over these “weak sisters” that 


had strayed across the Chattahoochee 


river. The end of the game found 
the Crimson completely converted toe 
the fact that Tech's is a real basket- 
ball team and scrap that refuse to 
admit defeat until referee informs 
them that hostilities are over. 


2 Jackets’ Stars. + 
vg ” Roane, Jimmy Brewster § ~~ 
and Al Station were the ouft-° © = 
standing stars for the Atlantans, © 


Brewster and Staton are Tech foot- ' ae 


ball players and were given much ap- . 
plause when they started. Their 
showing was good enough to earn the 
praise of the big crowd. Brewster did 
some things with the ball that ‘Tusca- 
loosa customers didn’t know existed 
and the work of Staton in guarding © 
the fleet forwards of the Alabama ° 
machine was brilliant. ‘ 
Stabler, Gazzoli and Carter were * 
the leading lights for the Alabamians, - 
Carter was high-scorer of the lot with © 
fifteen points, but Stabler was just - 
to the rear with fourteen. Gazzoli, ~

Another Big Week of Basketball 


Begins for Preps’ Supporters 


The second week of the Atlanta 
Prep league will be a very interesting 
one. First, the Boys’ High five plays 
the strong Gordon team from Barnes; 
ville, on the Boys’ High court, Tuesday 
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. The secon? 
interesting game of the week. will be 
played Wedensday night between the 
G. M. A, varsity and the Oglethorpe 
‘freshmen. -The place of that game has 
not been decided as yet, but will be 
announced later. 

The third and fourth games of the 
week will be played Friday afternoon 
at the Auditorium. Boys* High plays 
Marist, and. University plays’ Tech 
High. Both these games are well 


‘worth seeing, for the prep teams seem 


to have the best teams in the history of 
the league. Every team in the league 
is using the five-man defense system, 
and the games are as interesting as 
can be. It is a pleasure to see the 
teams trying to break through the op 
posing defense. 


Mosley’s Record. 


Coach Mosiey has been noted for the 
athletic teams turned out at Cordon 
imstitute. The game between Boys’ 
High and Gordon has always been an 
interesting feature of the prep basket- 
ball season in Atlanta... It will be one 
hot basketball game. 

The G. M. A. team plays the Ogle- 
thorpe Freshmen Wednesday night. 
The G. M. A, team has been practicing 
only a few weeks, and the game has 
been arranged for a real practice game 
for the cadets. 

After seeing the mm Satur- 
day night, there need ne comment 
on the prep games for Friday~after- 
noon, Each spenks for itsdf. Judg- 
ing from the opening scores, all five 
teams are about on an even basis. The 
Marist team has put on worlds of 
strength and now is right up in the 
running. All the teams have an equal 
chance at the penhant, and/there will 
certainly be some hot basketball bat- 
tles. before the season is. over. 

The two-for-one admission price for 
the prep games seems to be popular 
among the basketball fans. he at- 
tendance at the epening game was 
much better than expected.

complished in a short period and at a 
time when conditions were,not as rosy 
as in former years, when a question of 
delivery: was almost more important 
than a matter of price, 

Last year the great new Cumber- 
land factory was completed at a cost of 
nearly $13,000,600, gnd-this plant is 
now in & satisfactory state of produc- 
tion, while the Akron plant is running 
to full capacity. The output of these 
two factories bas put the Kelly com- 
pany into the competitive field and, .in 
spite of the difficult situation in 1921, 
when the bottom dropped out of 
business, literally overnight, and 
when two serious price cuts, to- 
taling a reduction of 30 per cent, were 
among some of the other difficuPties to 
be surmounted, the Kelly company, un- 
der the able sales management of Mr. 


Mowe, forged right ahead, ending the | 


year with an impressive increase in 


sales, both in the matter of units and. 


dollars. 

_Mr. Mowe joined the forces of the

Shepard reports that all passenger car

J. R. Regnas, general chairman of

Generals W. M. Brownlee and Ken-

FULL LabOR FORCE 
SECURED FOR WORK 
UPON TUGALO DAM 


Applications for work on the new 
Tugalo power project .of the Geor- 
gia Railway and Power company have 
n so numerous that the company 
announces it has secured the services 
of all men desired for the present, 
since about 300 men are already on 
the job. 

As the work progresses, it was add- 
ed, forces will be increased and men 
who have formerly been in the employ 
of the company on construction work 
of similar nature—such as that at 
Burton dam—will be taken back as 
soon as the work demands. 

The great demand for positions as 
soon as the: employment office was 
opened at 90 Decatur street has filled 
the present requirements, both as to 
superintendent, engineering talent 
and labor. It is said that skilled 
labor will not be needed on the proj- 
ect for approximately six months. 
Men who were formerly on the work 
have been asked to register at the 
Decatur street office so that. they 
may be notified as soon as the open- 
ings octur.

SHOE DEALERS REPORT 
SPLENDID CONVENTION 


Communications received from At- 
lanta shoe dealers in attendance at 
the national shoe retailers’ convention 
in Chicago, indicate the most success- 
ful convention of the kind ever staged 
by them. What is perhaps the most 
extensive exhibit of shoes was put on 
at the Coliseum in Chicago, and mem- 
bers of the Southeastern Shoe Retail- 
ers’ association, which includes in its 
membership many prominent Atlanta 
shoe dealers, report that they have 
been well repaid for the visit. 

e Southeastern Shoe Retailers’ as- 
sociation has just launched a cam- 
paign to double its membership before 
their next annual convention, which 
will be held at Jacksonville during 
June of this year. Circular letter was 
sent out during the Past week from the 
executive secretary’s office, 305 Con- 
nally building, directed to all the 
members of the association for the pur- 


pect for membership. This has b 

quite a number of new names, which 
will be followed up by the executive | 
secretary through the medium of a 
direct mail campaign, with the idea of 
securing their membership in the as- 
sociation.

E. H. SIMS, 


a 
publi ished showing this entire arrange-

The Icgislature at its last session ve

in the “tall and lost hea 
operators on the short side 
had made fortunes through the early 
part of 1921 that were wiped out in 
the fall advances. 
Liguidation Unimportant. 

Therefore, when this effort was 
made to get a big following of outside 
short selling, it did not succeed very 
well. Furthermore, liquidation was 
unimportant during the past week 
The result was that even though no 
pressure was brought to bear on the 
horta. they found out that hardly any 
stock was being offered in many 
issues, and on only a little covering, 
prices ,rallied very easily. 

The decided easing in money and 
the outlook for much better business 
in the spring were two factors that 


or bonds and investment _ stocks, 
which also tended to produce some 


sues. The result of it all was that 
the much-heralded “wide open breaks” 
in the market were seen in only one 
stock, and the net results of all of 
the declines the last two weeks, 
at the lows nearly every issue, 
was nothing m@re than a natural re- 
action after the prolonged advances of 
September to December. 

Many stocks that had advaneed 25 
to 30 points from the August lows 
of the Jast week were much less than 
‘10 points below the highs of December. 
Others that had advanced 10 to 20 
points in the fall were less than 5 
points below the December highs at 
the lows of the last week. 

One stock had a 15-point reaction 
from the December high to the recent 
low, but this was a particularly specu- 
lative issue, and its December bigh 
was nearly 30 points up from the olw 
of the last six. months. One or two 
iagues were really weak recently, but 
they were stocks of companies that are 
in a bad financial position, whereas 
on the majority of stocks the recent 
declines can be characterized only as 
an overdue reaction after such pro-. 
longed advances. Therefore, a sum- 
ming up of the markets so far this 
year would show that they are merely 
an incident and a phase of bull mar- 
kets, and that while a decided upward 
trend might not be resumed at once, 
it will be before very long. 

Selling Small. 

The selling was wo small in volume, 
the buying of too good quaiity, to indi- 
cate that the buil movement that start- 
ed the last week of August has ended 


‘through December a fair amount of 
public buying had started In the mar- 
ket, but it never had been large in 
voiume, The best demand had been 
from pools and from big operators, as 
far as specuiation is concerned, with 
a continuous good investment demand, 
Therefore, stocks had gone into very 
strong hands, and the action of the 
market in the last two weeks tends to 
give almost absolute proof of thia, 

The situation, therefore, would seem 
to be the same ag it has been for a 
long time, which is that the strong 
holders of stocks will continue to hold 
them and to keep the market gener- 
ally in tine until such time as the 
public buys stocks freely on sharply 
rising prices. Then it is to be expect- 
ed that the poola and big operators 
will sell, and when this public buying 
lets up, a real reaction will be seen. 

There bad been a distinct ou _— 
for this to happen in the curfent 
month, and the market through Decem- 
ber was shaping up for a big public 
demand. Possibly the reactions and 
the unfavorable news developments 
will postpone the big public buying 
until the end of the winter and early 
spring, but the easy way in which cer- 
tain of the speculative favorites ad- 
vanced at times in the last week gives 
some indication that a better market, 
may yet be seen in January on which 
many ‘aod will get to well over their 

mber highs. 

It is not probable, however, that 
the big volume of trading that will 
be necessary before there can be heavy 
distribution of stocks will be seen this 
month, Therefore,.while some sharp 
bulges.and sharp reactions are to be 
expected, it is not probable that a 
broad upward movement and a severe 
decline after it are immediately abead. 
Certain stocks probably will get into 
new high ground and see some distri- 
bition and then sell off sharply. but 
probably not very many. It is much 
more probable that the market as a 
whole will be generally fitm. with mod- 
erate reactions, for 
then go into a decided increase jn 
volume and strength in the months of 
March to Je. 

Bond Market. 

The bond market was quiet through 
the first ten days of the year, but 
started to gain in activity and strength 
towards the end of the last week, as 
did investment ag There is a 
large amount of money seeking invest- 
ment, but the market had been some- 
what overcrowded with offerings of 
new issues, bonds and stocks bought 
by speculators and dealers with a view 
of selling same at ristss ae penne, etc..

P. Jarnigan, director of hd 
animal husbandry department of the 
agricultural college, stated to report- 
ers that the creamery at the college 
can consume 2,000 gallons of milk 
a day, or the output of 1,200 cows. 
For this milk the college wjll pay 40 
cents a pound, and after the butter js 
made and sold, the profit made on it 
is divided among tke patrons furnish- 
ing the milk. 

“The agricultural college's cream- 
ery is absolutely a co-operative plant, 
and if the farmers of this part of the 
state would send it all the milk and 
butter fat which it can use, Athens 
and this part of the state woyid be 
better off financially by $2,: a 
week, or nearly $10,000 a month,” 
stated Dr. Jarnigan Friday. as he 
urged the farmers that they pay more 
attention to the possibilities offered 
today by the dairying plants. 

From the information obtained from 
Dr. Jarnigan, dairying is becoming 
very popular in Georgia, and within 
the past few weeks more creameries 
and cheese factories have been opened 
than any other one industry,

July 
Uct. 


New York, January 14.—The cot- 
ton market was quiet today and busi- 


ness seemed largely confined to even- 
ing up of commitments for over the 
week-end. A more optunistic view of 
iuropean political conditions was re- 
flected in an early advance, but aft- 
er selling at 18.04, March eased oit 
te 17.90 under’ scattering liquidation. 
It closed at that level, with the generai 
market closing steady net 1 yoint 
lower to 5 points higher. 

The opening was steady at an aa- 
vance of 6 to 16 points on the better 
view of conditions abroad and the 
census report showing a larger de- 
mestic consumption for December 
than anticipated. 

There also was some buying on 
London advices: reporting a generally 
optimistic feeling in the Lancashire 
evtton goods trade with predictions of 
a complete revivial within a few 
months. 

Week-end reviews of the domestic 
cotton goods situation showed no im- 
provement, however, and after initial 
buying orders had been supplied the 
mutket became very quiet with prices 
easing off from the best under. reai- 
izirg or scattered southern selling. 

According to the census report, do- 
mestic consumption last month 
amounted to 511,800 bales against 
295,292 last year, bat this showing 
was offset to some extent by the in- 
crease in mill stocks, which were 
placed at 1,737,771: bales on Decem- 
ber 31, compared with 1,251,122 last 
year. Very little, if anything, was 
heard from southern spot markets 
during the morning and conflicting 
reports ure being received as to new 
crop prospects and probable use of 
fertilizer next season. According to 
one of the reports in the market to- | 
day, a large fertilizer interest in the 
e..stern belt is offering to supply fer- 
tilizer to farmers on credit providing 
they will follow instructions for com- 
bating the boll weevil. Sales of 
print cloths in the Fall River, mar- 
ket for the week were. estimated at 
70,000 pieces and the curtailment of 
production at 65,000. The amount, 
of cotton on. shipboard awaiting clear- 
ance was placed at 78,000 against 
182,000 last year.

MODERATE BUYING 
AT NEW ORLEANS 


New Orleans, January 14.—Al- 
though mill figures were considered 
bullish, the cotton market today felt 
only moderate buying at any time, and 
there were periods when the demand 
was well supplied. Aronnd the open- 
ing prices were 9 to 12 points up, 
atfer which there was a sag to levels 
8 points under to 2 points over the 
close of yesterday, March first rising 
to 16.99 and then falling back to 
16.87. In the late trading, July made 
some display of strength, rising 12 
points over cer sey close. to 16.60, 
but other months did not follow. Last 
prices were net unchanzed to 6 points 
np, with March at 16.92 and July at 

American consumption during De- 
cember of 511,800 hales, according to 
the report by the census bureau which

was issued on the opening, was larger 
than expected, as private estimates 
were around 475.000 bales. The con- 
tinued increase in active spindles was 
regarded as being highly favorable, 
but after the first effect of the report 
wore off more or less selling came on 
the market from traders who did not 
like the increasing mill stocks, mills 
holding in their warehouses at the end 
of December 1, 737,771 bales of cotton 
against 1,648,216 at the end of No- 
vember. The selling movement was 
not pronounced, however, as many 
traders argued that if mills were ac- 
cumulating stocks it meant a contin- 
ued large consumption.

GAINS ARE MADE 


IN-STOCK TRADING 


New York, January 14.—Trading in 
the two-hour session of today's stock 
market was more active and embraced 


& greater variety of issues than at}j 


any full period of the week. Gains 
of one to almost three points were 
made by numerous issues co rising 
the leading industrials and spe 
but advances among rails were con- 
fined to a few transcontinentals, 
grangers and cotton carriers. 

-From surface ‘indications much of 
the large turn over represented short 
covering, but observers noted substan- 
tial buying of motors and es 
as well as metals, oils, chemicals a 
specialties. Among the latter son 
Coca-Cola and Wilson and company. 

Business in bonds was in keeping 
with the extensive market for shares, 
but the trend in that quarter was 
mixed. Liberty 3 1-2s, for example, 
were under further realizing, closing 
at a loss of 70 cents per $100. Rails 
and internationals were steadier and 
miscellaneous industrials also harden- 
ed. Total sales, par value, $13,350,000. 
The better tone extendgd to foreign 
exchanges, sterling demand bills risin 
to the week’s highegt quotation. Conti- 
nental remittances’ were~firm, the 
Italian rate being in no degree affect- 
ed. by cables announcing the suspen- 
sion of a bank in Palermo. 

A loss of about $40.600.000 in the 
actual cash account was the only un- 
usual item disclosed. by the weekly 
clearing house statement, reducing ex- 
cess reserve to little more than 
$16.000,000 

Mercantile trade reviews were fa- 
vorable, wholesale dry goods and simi- 
lar merchandise showing greater dis- 
tribution than during the same period 
of last year. Mail order houses also 
reported_an expansion of business and 
better Collections. 


PROFESSIONAL VIEWS 
ON COTTON SITUATION 


New York, January 14.—(Special.)—The 
consumption "figures issued by the govern- 
ment this moruing were more bulfsh than 
anticipated, causing our market to open 12 
to 15 points over last night’s close. It is 
a interesting to note the sieadily increas- 
a consumpion and is a recognized fact 
t the work! is steadily incrvasing con- 
sumption, and that this should offer encour- 
agement to the trade in general. Neverthe- 
less, the mills still perstst in waiting for 
lower prices, because of their inability to 
sell any goods forward. How long this will 
keep up we do not know, but there will 
come a fime when it will be urgent for the 
mills to enter the market heavily on the 
buying side. Until,/such time the market 
will probably remain easy, with a tendency 
to decline, HUBBARD BROS. & CU. 


New York, January 14.—(Special.)—The 
cotton market has developed into a very 
narrow affair, with trade being somewhat 
in a semi- deadlocked state. Demand in 
spot and futures markets contiues only 
moderate, with holders. resting steadily on 
their position. The most pronounced’ de- 
velopment of the week in the way of de- 
mand was the covering of 25,000 bales of | 
shorts Friday. Domestic cousumption fig- 
ures of 511,500 bales for December show 
good activity among spinners, but thig did 
not stimulate important buying. The fed- 


,eral reserve ratio for the week registering 


a rise from 71.1 per cent to 74.7 per cent, 
points clearly to the slackened demand for 
credit. We expect cotton to continue a 
scalping market, March Liverpool due Mon- 
day. ORVIS BROS. & OO~7

Brown Urges Americans 
to Readjust All Internal 
Affairs “While Waiting 
on Europeans. 


BY WALTER B. BROWN, 
Editor New York Commercial. 
(Written for The Constitution.) 
New York, January 14.—Recovery 

in American business affairs during 
tffe coming year is expected to be sub- 
stantial, but there seems to be some 
disappointment that there is not more 
of it in evidence at this time. Amen- 
can business is ready to revive just as 
svun as there is something to give it 
impetus, and that something resides 
not in America, but in Kurope. 

It is right and proper that . 
should do everything to put our oan 
house in order; that we should read- 
just ourselves to new conditions; that 
we should take up the slack wherever 
it shows itself, and that we should 
smooth out all the unevenness that we 
can. But the big fact remains that, 
until Europe has adopted a construc- 
tive program, we cannot go forward 
with that measure of acceleration upon 
which we must depend for continued 
prosperity. 

Effect of Resignation. 

At this writing, the European situa- 
tion has received something of a jolt 
because of the crisis in French fities, 
It is rather difficult for Americans te 
comprehend French politics, as ne

of 50 per cent. ‘The repeal of the excess profits tax, though deferred, 
gives relief from a burdensome and intricate form of taxation after 
December 31, 1921, and should add incentive to the revival of corporate 
activities. The failure to reduce surtaxes to a point which will attract 
the possessors of large incomes to invest in taxable securities, instead 
of non-taxables, is a source of general disappointment. 

The new rates of tax for 1922: are of particular interest to tax- 
payers carrying on businesses as individuals or partnerships, and it 
may be found advisable, because of the discrimination in taxes between 
individuals and partnerships and corporations to change the form of 
business organization to avoid the imposition of heavy surtaxes. 

' effect of the differences in the form of taxation of corporate and non- 
corporate. concerns having large incomes can best be shown by com- 
-parison of two concerns with the same income, one operating as @ 
corporation and the other as a partnership. 


porations. .The s 


Partnership. 

Let us consider, for example, a 
partnership consisting of two mem- 
bers, earning a net income for 1922 of 
$600,000. Assuming that the partners 
had no other income outside of their 
partnership earnings, each would he 
subject to a tax of $144,640, whether 
or not the earnings of the partnership 
were distributed. If the same con- 
cern, with two stockholders, were in- 
ecorporated, it would pay a corpora- 
tax of $75,000 and the individual 
‘stockholders would pay only on the 
amount of the earnings actually dis- 
tributed. 

Thus, if each stockholder received 
in dividends only $50,000 and the bal- 
ance were retained for employment in 


findividual tax of each stockholder, pro- 
viding such dividens constitute the 
entire income, would be $4,960. The 
total tax of the corporation and the 
two stockhélders, if the business were 
incorporate” therefore, would be $84,- 
920, as against a total of $289.2S0, if 
the business were conducted as a 
partnership. 

The discrimination in tax in such 
eases would be very serious to individ- 
uals and partneships who desire to 


“e. leave their earnings in their business 


» 


to meet obligations or to take care of 
extensions and expansion, and incor- 
poration may be necessary to overcome 
the heavy penalty of operating as a 
yp. rtnership or individual. 

This discrimination was marked in 
the case of partnerships and corpora- 
tions even when the excess profits 
"tax was in effect, but the elimination

tention of high rates of surtax have 
greatly increased the inequality. Con- 
gress, in the new law, has recognized 
the’ injustice of imposing high surtax 
and _ individ-

has accordingly provided that in the

The rates of 


The

come of a corporation is taxed. In 
such cases the undisturbed “profits of 
the. corporation for 1921 and there- 
after would not be subject to individ- 
ual income tax, only the amounts dis- 
tributed being taxed as dividends. The 
privilege afforded taxpayers under this 
section is not allowed to any trade or 
business, the net income of which for 
th> taxable year 1921 was less than 20 
per cent of its invested capital for 
such year. 

Partnerships with smaller incomes 
will fare better under the new law 
than a corporate business similarly 
constituted. For example, the indi- 
vidual members of a partnership com- 
posed of two members and having a 
net income for 1922 of $50,000 will 
pa" a tax ir the aggregate of $5,120, 
assuming that neither has income other 
than his partnership profits and that 
each receives a personal exemption of 
12.000.. A corporation similarly con- 
stituted and having the same income 
would nay a corporatidn income tax 
of $6.250 and the individual partners 
would be subject to surtax on any 
amount of the corporation profits dis- 
tributed as dividends. : 
No Taxable Profit by Incorporation. 

There was formerly one difficulty 
in the incorporation of an individual. 
or partnership business which has 
heen removed under the present law. 
Under the provisions of the revenue 
act of 1918, as interpreted’ by the 
treasury department, where property 
was transferred to a corporation in 
éxchange for its stock the exchange 
constituted a closed transaction, and 
the owner of the property realized a 
eain or loss if the stock had a mar- 
ket value and such market value was 
greater or less than the cost or the 
fair market value as of March, 1918, | 
of the property given in exchange. 

In many cases the business prop- 
erty of an individual had greatly in- 
creased in value and to incorporate 
meant that it would be necessary to 
pay heavy surtaxes on an apprecia- 
tion in value which had not been real- 
ized. 

Under the new law, when (1) a 
person transfers any property, real, 
personal or mixed, to a eorporafion

One exception covers the exchange

productive use in the trade or busi- 
ness, for property of a like kind or 
use. Another exception is made in 
the case of a person or persons who 
transfer property to a corporation for

and who, immediately after the trans- 
fer, are in control of such corporation, 
which was discussed above.

vestments, from “gilt-edged oil compa-

Instead of consulting a legitimate 
banker of known standing and re 
tion, many individuals, who knew 
nothing of financial matters, were in- 
duced to purchase with good cash from 
unknown individuals, these so-called 
stock certificates, which they were led 
to believe. were choice investments, 
which would make them rich, They 
found, later, much to their surprise, 
that they had paid much in excess of 
their market value, or that they really 
had no value at all. Many thousands 
of dollars. were taken out of the state 
in this way. 

For the protection of the innocent, as 
well as for the protection of the legiti- 
mate investment banking concerns in 
the state, many representatives of the 
leading investment bankers were called 
into conference: with state officials, 
and “the Georgia securities law” was 
carefully drawn. up, passed and suc 
cessfully put into operation over. a 
year ago. A _ securities commission 
was created, consisting of the secretary

merger or consolidation, recapitaliza-

The first thirteen days of 1922 have 
brought no bad luck to the man who

of state, the attorney-general, the com- 
missioner of commerce and labor, and 
a chief examiner of investment securi 
ties. Itis theduty of the commission 
to investigate the standing, reputation 
and business methods of every security 
dealer in Georgia who offers for sale 
any bonds, stock, certificates or other 
forms of investments, to obtain full in- 
formation concerning the various. in- 
vestments offered by them, to register 
and keep on file the names of such in- 
dividuals, companies and their address; 
to license those who qualify under the 
law; to prevent and restrict the offer: 
ing and sale of fraudulent securities, 
bogus advertising and the misrepresen- 
tation of securities by fraudulent circu- 
lation through the mails, or by per- 
sonal solicitation by unknown, dishon- 
est individuals. It is now unlawful 
for any individual, company or firm to 
sell stocks or other forms of invest- 
ment without first making application 
for and paying for a license to engage 
in the investment banking business jn 
the state of Georgia, if. they handle 
securities of certain classes as specified 
under this new law. 

It will be seen at once that this re- 
quirement alone is a valuable and de- 
sirable one.from every standpoint. The 
violation of this law is now a misde- 
meanor, subject to penalty. Under these 
conditions, firms and individuals are 
less likely to attempt the sale of illegiti- 
mate securities for fear of being caught, 
reported and prosecuted.

Securities in class D are all others 
not-coming within the first three clas- 
sifications which are considered of a 
more speculative, risky, new, obscure 
or unknown character. Securities in 
this class cannot be sold without a 
license and then not unless the deal- 
ers have first filed with the commis- 
sion a statement showing a descrip- 
tion and the amount of securities to 
be offered for sale, a certified copy of 
the company charter of incorpora- 
tion and by-laws, the names and ad- 
dress and prior occupations for a 
}riod of not less than eight years prior 
to filing such statement of all the of- 
ficials, directors, trustees. agents and 
salesmen concerned jn the issuance 
and sale of such securities. The law 
further reguires that the nature of 
the industry and .the address of the 
company’s principal officials be on file, 
together: with a statement of the com- 
pany’s gross income and operating ex- 
penses for a period of 12 months, a 
copy of the last balance shéet showing 
:nventory and appraisement of assets,

form of the securities themselves, and

It will be seen at once that the 
protective measures of such good leg: 
islation have a most beneficial effect 
and smoencn egy 4 safeguards every- 
one, especially the uninformed pur- 
chaser about to make his first invest- 
ment. Thus he may instantly know 
from the above classification exactly 
what class of momeeee under this law

his appearance for the first time and 
comes unrecommended and unknown, 
a2 prospective purchaser may now ask 
him to state what class his ware are 
in, and if in C and D, he can instantly 
require him to exhibit his license. 
Furthermore, reference may be had 
to the securities commission or a reg- 
ular investment banker for informa-

company he represents and full infor- 
mation concerning the stock or other 
securities that he may offer for ‘sale,

Fourteen years ago Mr. Warman, 
who had™then been for five years 
connected with the Ragan-Malone com- 
pany, conceived the idea of entertain- 
ing the merchants and yers . with 
whom he did business at a dinner, 
| where, through discussion and con- 
ference the cord year could be re- 
viewed and the coming year forecast.: 
At the first dinner given 16 guests 
gathered and éveryone present felt 
that the evening had Been well and 


a spent. y 

ach year since that time, Mr. 
Warman has entertained, but on an 
ever-increasing scale—and the event 
has grown in importance with each 
new year. It has been Mr. Warman’s 
plan to + hb his annual banquet abont 
the middle of January, after the holi- 
day rush was over and just before 
the hard work for the coming year 
began, believing that at this time the 
best judgment and clearest insight to 
commercial conditions were to be had. 

Some of the most notéd speakers 
and business men of the country have 
been guests and speakers at these ar- 
fairs and national attention and pub- 
licity have résulted, The Warman 
dinner has come to be looked forward 
to as the voice of the southeast from 
a commercial] standpoint for each com- 
ing year,

been the direct result of preventing 
the sale of worthless paper ,certifi-

ing those who have recently acquired 
funds for investment to obtain the 
true facts concerning investment se-

vised the newspaper of the frandulent 
intent and the advertisement was pre- 
vented from publication again. ure 
thermore, the people were warned 
against the purchase of this stock 
and were saved from losing many hard- 
earned dollars. It is _a known fact 
that one single concern sold more 
than $1,000,000 worth of its stock in 
Georgia during the year 1920. There 
were other concerns, as well, and it is 
safe to say that the total losses of

to our domestic situation is found in 
the hands of the farmer. Here is 
what some of our big men say: 
“Due to further readjustment ‘that 
must be made in many aspects of 
trade,” James 8. Alexander, president 
of. the National Bank of Commerce, 
says, “no great or speedy revivai is 
likely. However, better general dusi- 
ness conditions and more satisfactory 
results can be reasonably expected for 
1922 compared with 1921. There is no 
cause to fear a general collapse of 
commodity prices, but the presence of 
over-stocks in some lines is an ele- 
ment of price instability. The farmers’ 
buying power depends both on the crop 
outlook for the coming season and on 
{a rdéduction in retail prices. It is 
reasonable to expect that there will be 
further readjustments of retail prices 
into line with prices which farmers 
receive for their products.” 

David R. a president of the 
National City nk of Chicago, be 
lieves we are now headed towards re-

Broken in 1921 


Storms. and Tornadoes Kill. 
; Two Persons, Injure Others ne 


~€. F. Von Herrmann’s complete 
weather report for 10921, which was 
given out for publication Seturday aft- 
ernoon, shows that the year was the 


warmest in’ the state's history, and 
that two lives were lost, many people 
were injured and property descroyed 
to the value of approximately $170,000 
by storms and torn 

The statement shows that only four 
months recorded temperatures below 
normal, May, July, August and Oc- 
tobery as compared with eight months | 
with temperature above normal, ‘The 
extremes were 1.9 degrees below nor- 
mal during May and 1.7 degrees below 
normal during October, while March 
bad a mean temperature of 7.7 de- 
grees, and September 6.2 
above normal. 

The average mean temperature for 


Georgia dyring the entire year was | 
66.1 degrees, or the warmest year that | 


Georgia has experienced since 1891, 
the first year the bureau began pre- 


: Unique Months. 
March, April, May and September 


' were eccentrie months from a weather 
, standpoint. May experienced an aver- 
' age mean temperature of 1.9 degrees 
i below normal. 


“From May 10 to 12,” said Mr. Von 
Herrmann, “Georgia experienced nu- 


‘merous and localJy destructive hail- 


storms, which covered an extensive 
area north of the line drawn from 
Macon to Augusta. More than 20 
stations reported hail, and only the 
comparatively undeveloped condition 
of crops prevented great loss. Hail- 

nes as large as one and three- 
foutth inches in diameter were re- 
ported in_ places, with damage to 
window glasa, roofing and other prop- 
erty. A moderately severe windstorin 
occurred at Atlanta on May 11, with 
a velocity of 56 miles an hour from 
the northwest, with some minor dam- 
age to street signs, trees and the. 
like.” 

During March and April, says Mr. 
vop Herrmann’s statement, Georgia 
lost approximately $170,000, two lives, 
and many people were injured, as the 
result of destructive storms and tor- 
nadoes “On March 31 at 2:15 p. m.,” 
says the statement, “a local storm oc- 
curred at Albany which seems to have 
possessed some of the characteristics 
of a tornado. Two colored people were 
killed, numerous persons injured, and 
the damage to property probably ex- 
ceeded $100,000. The greatest loss 
was sustained by the numerous indus- 
trial plants in north Albany. but 
many small dwellings were demolished 
and shade trees blown down. 

“During April,” says the statement, 
“several local storms possessing ap- 
parently some of the characteristics 
of small torradoes although no funnel- 
shaped clonds were observed, occurred. 
On the 16th at 11:40 a. m. a rather 
severe storm passed over the northern 
part of Rome, causing damage to prop- 
erty estimated at $50,000, Many large 
trees were blown down and houses 
unroafed., Six persons were injured. 
Later on the same day a severe thun- 
derstorm oecurred at Blakely reach- 
ing its maximum intensity about 10 
p. m.*The heavy rains that fell caused 
the flooding of small streams, with 
damage to mill dams, bridges, etce., 
estimated at over $15,000. A more 
modetate disturbance occurred at 
Thomasville on April 22 at 1:40 p. m., 
moving from the west; estimated dam- 
age to property $1,000, or less.” 

September Breaks Records. 

One of the most exceptional months 
of the year was September. Its aver- 
age mean temperature was $1.2 de- 
grees, or 6.2 degrees above normal; it 
was the hottest month of the year, 
and the hettest month on record in 
Georgia since 1892, and the only time 
that the state mean for September 
has equalled 80 degrees. “The tem- 
perature,” says the statement, “was 
above normal. during every day in 
the month at all stations. At every 
station in Georgia, except those north- 
west of the upper Chattahoochee, the 
September monthly mean  tempera- 
tures were the highest for any month 
of the year 1921. At every station 
in Georgia, excepting Talbotton and 
Valdosta, the monthly mean tempera- 
ture for September, 1921, exceeded all 
previous monthly. means for Septem- 
ber on record, extending in some cases 
as far back as 1819. At the following 
stations the September, 1921, monthly 
mean temperature equals or exceeds 
the monthly mean for any month of 
the year throughout the entire period 
of records available—Columbus, Mar- 
= pegears Newnan, and Bainbridge. 

e number of days with the maxi- 
mum temperature 90 degrees, or 
above, was exceeded for September 
at all ‘stations. 

“Owing to the continuows heat, de- 
ficiency in precipitation and intense 
sunshineys as well as to the ravages 
of the boll weevil, cotton deteriorated 
rapidly during the month and at the 
close the percentage condition as re- 
ported by the bureau of crop estimates 
was. the poorest in the history of. 
Georgia.” 

Only during three months was the 
rain precipitation above the normal— 
May, July and November. The other 
nine months experienced precipitation 
below the normal fall. 

The forecast for Sunday in Atlanta 
and Georgia is fair and warmer 
weather. Atlanta. experienced tem- 
nerature 6 degrees helow freezing 
Saturday morning. The lowest tem- 
perature recorded in the United States 
Saturday morning was at Chicago, 
where the thermometer dropped to 
S degrees. |

doubt, it is difficult for the French 
to comprehend American politics, but 
it it comes to that, it is often extreme- 
ly difficult for us to understand our 
ewn politics. ee 

Thus, we find one department of the 
government doing its best to.stimulate 
foreign trade, and another one throw- 
ing every obstacle in its way. Aristide 
Briand has seemed to the American 
mind to be a statesman of broad vi- 
sion, working constructively “for the 
rehabilitation of Europe. It is true 
we have not been altogether - pleased 
with the French attitude on the disar- 
mament question, but we have been i: 
clined to.look upon the former French 
premier’s movements as a-play for po- 
sition. 

Interest in Probable Course. 

It is not possible, as yet, to know 
whether M. Briand’s successor wil] 
coutinue the negotiations with Lloyd 
George against aggression. Press dis: 
patches thus far indicate that the’ 


French premier would have obtained a | 


vote of confidence had he rmained in 
office. Only three years ago, as M. 
Viviani points out, France was all 
enthusiasm for the supposed guarantee 
of French security by Great Britain. 
contained in the Versailles treaty, 
That, at best, was a vague promise; 
The agreement that was under negoti- 
ation between Briand and Lloyd 
George placed this in definite form in 
return for which France was to av- 
sume a more tolerant attitude toward 
Germany, not from any sentimental 
reasons, but purely on the basis of ex- 
pediency. Recognizing the fact that it 
is difficult to visualize a_ situation 
3. miles away, nevertheless, as 
viewed through American eyes, France 
seems to be her own worst. enemy at 
this time.

THE WILSON MEMORIAL. 


The patriotic campaign for a’ 
fund of $1,000,000 for the establish- 
ment of a Woodrow Wilson founda- 

tion, the purpose of which is to 
perpetuate the Wilson ideals of 


permanent peace and international 
amity, culminates on Monday; and 
reports from all parts of the coun- 
try signify that the fund will be 
oversubscribed. | 

Of the total amount, the pro rata 
shafe allotted to Georgia is $35,000, 
and of all the states this should be 


the first to announce its quota 


subscribed for with the probable 
exception of New Jersey there is 
no other state with which the life 
of the great humanitarian presi- 
dent has such intimate and tender 
associations. 

It was in Atlanta that Woodrow 
Wilson as a youth was admitted to 
the bar and bégan the practice. of 
law. , 

It was here that he entered upon 
tle career that led not only to the 
presidency, but that reached the 
very pinnacle of international 
fame, and led to the position which 


Woodrow Wilson occupies today— | 


that of the most exalted private cit-

It is a splendid thing for the

Woodrow Wilson to be able to pay

THE HOME PRODUCT. 


way that things will turn 


* 
* ; 


“4m the meantime that the state 


nity by not living more closely at 
home is brought out quite forcibly 
in the report of W. R. Crites, sec- 
retary of the Millen and Jenkins 
county chamber of commerce. 


| Prior to making his report, Mr. 
Crites- made an exhaustive can- 
vass of the stores in his com- 
munity in an effort to find out. 
some of the things which are hold- 
ing back Georgia development. 
What he found reveals a situation 
which, if not alarming, is at least 


exceedingly suggestive. 
Mr. Crites shows what we are 
buying and where our money is 


going. 
Comprehensive as is this list, 
Mr. Crites adds that “there is uot 
one single item in it which could 
aot be produced in Georgia.” _ 
Here is what we are buying 
from a distance— 


“Peas from Maine and Maryland; 
beans from Michigan, New York 
and California; e@eweet corn from 
Maine, New York and California; 
potatoes, from Maine; sweet pota- 
toes, from Maryland and New Jer- 
sey; tomato catsup, from New Jer- 
sey, Pennsylvania, New York and 
Indiana; pickles, “57 | varieties,” 
from Pittsburg; peaches, from Cali- 
fornia; with a country overflowing 
with Georgia cane syrup at any~- 
thing from 25c a gallon up, we are 
paying a high price for corn syrup 
from New York; with 20,000,000 
surplus bushels of corn, we are 
‘buying grits, lye hominy, cornmeal 
and ‘corn starch from Iowa, IUli- 
nois, Pennsylvania and New York; 
nglish walnuts, from California; 
tomatoes, from California and New 
York: sauer kraut, from New York; 
vegetable soups, from Indiana; red 
beets, from Maine; honey, from New 
York and California; apple jelly, 
from Missouri and Maryland; pea- 
nut butter, from New York; pea- 
nutes, from Virginia; tobacco, from 
all over the world; soap, from Cin- 
cinnati, made from our own cot- 
ton seed olls; mules, from Ken- 
tucky and Missouri; cereals, from 
Michigan, Ohio and Illinois; cheese, 
from Wisconsin and New York; 
rice, from New Orleans, China and 
Japan; brooms, from Florida, Ala- 
bama and Ohio; apples, from New 
York, Oregon and Washington; 
matches, from Ohio and Michigan; 
pimentoes, from Spain and New 
York; meats, all kinds, from Chi- 
cago jand South America; sausage, 
from Green Bay, Wis.; crackers, j 
from Virginia; ginger. ale, from 
Wisconsin and New York grape 
juice; from.Catifornia and New Jer- 
eey; vinegar, from Virginia; con- 
densed milk, from California and 
Washington; oysters from Maryland 
and New Jersey; hay, from the cen- 
tral states; cotton goods, from Mas- 
sachusetts, Georgia cotton coming 
back to us with three or four prof- 
its’ and exorbitant freight rates 
added over and abévé what we re- 


‘eeive for it on a speculator’s mar- 


ket; woolen goods, that should ve 
made of wool from Georgia-raised 
sheep; furniture, from Michigan 
and Pennsylvania, made from 
southern jumber, and there are still 
other items in the list.” 

‘With chambers. of commerce 
ike that of Millén and Jenkins 
counties, pointing the way to the 
farmer, to the business man, and 
to the consumer, long strides can 
quickly be taken to convert de- 
pression into prosperity. 

The farmer insists on relying 
chiefly on cotton as his money 
crop, ‘because he lacks a ready 
market for all his crops save 
cotton. 

In the south there is an abun- 
dance of chickens, eggs, COWS, 
butter, milk, hogs, corn, syrup, ap- 
ples, sweet and Irish potatoes. 
But comparatively a small part of 
these products are being shipped 
to the north and west. 

Why? 

Simply because we are permit- 
ting growers of the same products 
in- other states to force their 
‘products over ours because they 
know better how to market them. 
The average farmer, say, will 
raise ten or twelve head of hogs 
for market. It has been proven 
that the only way in. which hogs 
can be marketed profitably is. in 
carload lots and it seéms jogical 
that farmers in each neighborhood 
would get together for such ship- | 
ments. But this has been done 
in only a very limited way because 
the farmers have not as yet been 
made to see, in actual dollars and 
cents, the value of co-operation. 

Take the. 
Georgia yam, as an interesting 
illustration of the possibilities for 
marketing southern products. This 
luscious, vegetable is. _searcely 


| known in the north and’ west. Out 


of a total crop of 103,000,000 
bushels of these potatoes grown in

great chain of grocery stores of che 
L. W. Rogers company, in which 
Mr, -Alien stated’ that while he 
would much préfer to spend in 
Georgia the, thousands of dollars 
being sent by his company mo 

ly to California, he had of neces- 
sity to give preference to beans 
from there simply because Cali- 
fornia knew how to prepare and 
market beans grown. there while | 
Georgia did not. — ‘ 

In California the beans are care- 
fully . winnowed, then cleaned, 
graded and classified.. They are 
put in neat boxes, attractively 
labeled, and then they are ready 
for market, 

The Georgia bean is as good as 
the California bean but it is not 
put up that way. 

‘The result.is that Georgia is 
sending out of the state every 
year thousands of dollars for 
beans no better than those grown 
right here. 

And the same thing applies to 
other farm products that can be 
raised as well in Georgia as in 
any other state. 

The Millen and Jenkins county, 
chamber of commerce, and Mr. 
Crites, have set an example that 
other counties in Georgia: migh 
follow with profit. 


USE FOR OLD CLOTHES. 

The Spirit of 78, the “house or- 
gan” of Lodge No. 78, Benevolent. 
and Protective Order of Elks, At- 
lanta, has called the attention of 
local Elks to a beneficent use to 
which discarded articles of wear-. 
ing apparel belonging to them or 
their families may be put—that is, 
in providing comfort for the poor. 

Last Christmas this splendid or- 
ganization presented holiday gifts 
to more than 1,300 Atlanta chil- 
dren whom Santa Claus otherwise 
might have overlooked, and dis- 


‘tributed 425 Christmas baskets 


among families proven by investi- 
gation to be-both worthy and in 
need.

“Fellows, listen: There’s lots of

Elks have tried to supply, Dut much

clothés these cold days afid nights,

day almost chilled because they 
haven't sufficient clothing. ; 
“And here you ara with plenty of

He called upon the workers of 
Atlanta to “give time . and 
thought” to ways and means to 
improve conditions in our public 
schools, particularly in the matter 
of free textbooks as a logical eom- 
panion to compulsory school at-

state institutions, all of which is 
commendable, | 
And in discussing purely local 
conditions he said of the agitation 
for reforms in the government of 
Atlanta: “The new charter for 
the city is soon to be an issue. Let- 
us not be hasty in reaching a con- 
clusion as to its merits or demerits. 
This subject should be studied and 
all sides heard from at a later

NEWSPAPER POETS. 

The critics of “newspaper po- 
etry,” as they teria it, who in one 
sweéping Verdict condemn it t6 or-. 
dinary' scrapbook’ ‘pages, as wun- 
worthy of literary eminence in li- 
braries, are themselves condemned 
and their judgments reversed al- 


partments of many leading news- 
papers, 

As a matter of fact, some of the 
best poetry written in this country 
today appears first in the columns} 
of the daily or weekly press. The 
literary magazines have never had/ 
a monopoly of it—and they never 
will, 

A casé in point is furnished by | 
The New York Tribune, whose 
daily column, “The Tower,” was 
made famous by :Franklin P. 
Adams, now with The New York 
World. ' 

The modest initials of “F. F. V.,” 
are now signed to that column, 
and recently it carried this sonnet | 
from his pen, entitled, “The Last} 
Tourney”— 

“Tt shall ga aoeth one day to joust 


with death; 
The brittle little chains that hold 


me tied 
To rusted hopes, to visions cracked 


and dried, 
Shall break, and I shail hear the 


trumpet’s breath 
Go- clamoring across the barren 


heath, 
And for a flaming moment I shall} 


ride 
The lists’ brief course to meet the 
Undefie 
And take the blow that I shal) fall 
beneath, 


“Bach day I make this eingle fer- 
vent prayer: 
May then the blood of Bayard be 


my own; 
ride hard and straight and 
smite him square,’ 
And in a clash of arms be over- 


thrown; 

And as I fall hear through the eve- 
ning air 

The distant horn of Roland, faintly 
blown.” 


Verse like that, some apprecia- 
tive reader will say, “should have 


it best just where it spoke the 
strong, true, poetic word to us—in 
its newspaper setting, from its first 
to its last haunting Hne— 


“The distant horn of Roland faintly 
blown.”

of Oxford—a fitting fanfare, leading 
up to the triumphal entrance of Rha- 
dames, ritornato vincitor. 

And so, indeed, the leas inevitable 
literary introduction may be merely 
the drum beat to ‘herald a glorious 
youpg talent—Mr,. Wells welcoming

sweet potatoes produced in Georgia 
were marketed through one great sales 
agency, that agency could make the 
Georgia yam known as a distinctive 
and Yelectable product from coast to 
coast; at a cost that the individual 
farmer would hardly feel. 

The second ‘factor is that of finan- 
cial ability. Given exactly the same

These state associations, by obtain-

sources which they could not other- 
wise have obtained, have made it nec- 


‘essary for private marketing interests 


to extend similar credit, though to a 
lesser extent, to independent growers, 
and the result is that there is a good 
deal of general credit available in 
the present cotton market. 


tions, it is unpleasant to think what 
the present price of cotton would be 
had not this credit development taken 
place. Likewise, it is now a great 
pity that a flood of outside money is 
not already flowing into Georgia as it 
is into the states where the existing 
cotton associations are actually in 
business, 

Suppose, now, that the marketing 
organization or group of organiza- 
tions in the field of a single product 
is not only on a large scale, but on 
such a large scale that this organiza-

trols a proportion of the entire vol- 
ume of the production se great that 
by withholding it at any time it is 
capable of producing a temporary 
shortage in the flow to the immediate 
market. An organization of such size 
can prevent any decline in prices not 
justitied. by tundamentél economic 
conditions, and that means stabiliza- 
tion of the market. 

It also means the difference be- 
tween prosperity and ruin for the 
south.

scale selling organization and its ab-

The most enlightened statesman in 
central, Europe has said of the war 
and its aftermath, “Only one con- 
queror’s work will endure—Wilson’s 
‘thought.” Hamilton Holt, comment- 
ing upon this statement, says: “Elis- 
tory will so regard him, but in the 
meantime the Woodrow Wilson foun- 
dation offers an opportunity to steal 


a march upon history.” Whaet an al- 
luring invitation! ‘To steal a march 
on history.” It is to anticipate the 
verdict of mankind. It is to enter into 
the joy of the fulfillment of propliecy 
and into partnersbip with those whe 
make history. 

One of the mwst significant inci- 
dents in the life of Jesus of Nazareth 
was the occasion ®hén He asked His 
disciples, “Whom do men say that I 
am?” They replied that He was: 
generally held to be one of the old 
prophets, Then, turning to these 
men, with His heart in His eyes and 
His voice vibrant with the eafnest- 
ness of anxiety, He asked, “But whom 
say ye that lam?’ The whole future 
of His enterprise seemed to depend 


upon the answer. There followed Pe- 
ter’s immortal confession, ‘“Thou art 
the Christ.”.. Then the eyes of the 
great founder of a religion lit with 
triumph. “Upon this rock 1 will build 
my church.” If an ordinary man like 
Simon Peter is capable of receiving 
into his heart the divine revelation 
of the significance of the personality 
of Jesus, then human life is capable 
of responding to the divine appeal, and 
“the gates of death shall not prevail 
against it.” |

Yes, no man is complete within 
himself. Indeed nothing has any sig-

BY FRANK H, SIMONDS 
Washington, January 14.—(Special.)—-Already the Washington con- 
’ ference is very clearly giving way for that gathering at Genoa at 
which the problem of economic regeneration will, replace that of dis- 
armament. In reality, however,’there will be a new field for a battle, 
the battle between the British and French conceptions of Europe, the 
battle between the two maps, the political and the economic map. 
And since it is about these conflicting conceptions that the strug- 
gle of the forthcoming conference will centér, I shall try in the pres- 
ent article briefly to present the French and British views. 
will be in many ways the most ambitious and important international 
undertaking since the Paris conference. 
start the’ wheels of the industrial world turning, and failure may 
spell ruin for Europe; and success or failure will come as British and 
French representatives are able to compromise or, bound by views of 
their respective nations, repeat the recent Washington performance 


over the submarine. 

FRENCH CONCEPTION 
OF EUROPE. 

What is the French conception of 
Furope? Primarily political 
the British is economic. France sees 
the future safety of the Europe created 
by the trgaty of Versailles, and wnly 
in such a Europe is their any security 
for France, dependent upon the sur- 
the so-called “succession 
tate,” the countries created or gragtly 
transformed by the~-Paris treaties 
which liquidated the world war. 

The French thesis is quite simple. 
By virtue of the decisions reached at 
Paris Poland regained a freedom 
which had been destroyed more than 
a full century before. Rumania, by 
acquiring lands inhabited by Latin 
majorities more than doubled her popu- 
lation, and on three sides obtained 
- frontiers which give promise of prov- 
ing fencible. Czecho-Slovakia succteed- 
ed to that title of Bohemian inde- 
pendence, the last semblance of which 
disappeared,in the fatal days of the 
thirty years’ war. Jugo-Slavia gath- 
ered under one soverignty all of the 
southern Slavs, hitherto divided over 
centuries. 

Now the French idea is that if these 
several states, Poland, with a popula- 
tion of more than 30,000,000, Ruma- 
nia with nearly 18,000,000, Czecho- 
Slovakia with 13,000,000 and Jugo- 
Slavia with more than 11,000,000, can 
endure long enough to acquire nation- 
#1 solildarity and political unity, to get 
a real start in life, so to speak, then 
ithe new Europe, which is expressed 
by them will also endure. French 
diplomacy has sought then, by systems 
of alliances to insure this survival and 
a system of alliance has brought nto 
a measure of agreement nearly 75,- 
000,000 of people. 

Behind this combination, numeri- 
cally impressive, at least stands 
France with 40.000,000 of people and 
* the strongest army in the world. . The 
French army is the real guarantor of 
the independence of Poland, always 
threatened by Germany and the Polish 
urmy may one day prove as valuable 
an aid to France as was the Russian 
urmy in the terrible days which pre- 
ceded the battle of the Marne in Sep- 
tember, 1914. 

*Krench statesmen believe that if Po- 
lund can have time to achieve a real 
national organization, she will be- 
come one of the great powers of Eu- 
rope, for she has a greater area and 
natural resources than Italy, and a 
population which increases with very 
great rapidity. A Poland of 40,000,- 
vOO or even 50,000,000 of inhabitants 
could one day serve as a solid barrier 
to any German expansion eastward, 


any German exploitation of Russia, 


which to the French mind would 
threaten European liberty. 

STATES STAND 

AS BULWARK. 

Ramania, to the south. serves simi- 
larly as a bulwark against Russian ad- 
vance into the center of Europe. Also, 
larger than Italy. with a-fertile coun- 
iry,and a prolific peonle, Rumania is

at leastas great as that of Franec or 
Italy today. Andin alliance with Po- 


of things as they stand in the east of 
Europe. Moreover, a_ strong Ru- 
mania, united by alliance with Jugo- 
Slavia, bars the read of German ad- 
vance southward, closes the door tw 
that Mitteleuropa of which we heard 
so much during the worid war. 


If you look at the map, you will 
see that Poland. Rumania and Jugo- 
Slavia, stretching iu a wide circle from 
the Baltic to the Adriatic, bur the 
pathway of Germany toward Constan- 
tinople, toward the Aegean and the 
Black seas, towafd Russia. More- 
over, the great Peninsula of Bohemia. 
which detaches itself from this mase 
of non-German territory and extends 
northward, holds the dominant frac- 
tion of that Czecho-Slovak population 
whose future dependseu pon restric- 
tion of German aspirations. 


Rumania and© Poland are today 
united by an allianceg@vhich envisages 
any attempt of Russia to destroy the 
independence or restrict the area of 
either. Poland and Czecho-Slovakia 
are united in common defense of their 
independence against a German at- 
tack; Czecho-Slovakia, Rumania and 
Jugo-Slavia are united to preserve the 
status of the Danube valley, to re- 
strict any attempts of the Hungarians 
or the Bulgarians to regain territo- 
ries lost in recent wars. Finally, 
Greece is also bound by an agreement 
toact with Rumania and Jugo-Slavia 
against any Bulgarian attack upon 
either. 

France believes that this system of 
alliances will insure the preservation 
of existing conditions for at least two i 
decades, certainly for the time during 
which French armies stand on German 
soil on the left bank of the Rhine, and | 
German military regeneration is thus 
rendered impossible. What may hap- 
pen twenty or twenty-five years from 
now, 'no one can safely predict. but at 
least there is a fair chance that. at 
the end of that time, the’ “succession 
states” will bé able to defend them- 
selves; that Europe will have more or 
less settled down to the existing order. 

Obviously, if the French army were 
largely reduced ; if French troops were 
withdrawn trom the Rhine; if Polish 
and Rumanian and Slav armies were 
cut down, the situation would change. 
I. veryone knows that the German pur- 
pose to regain the lands lost to Pol- 
land, lands which contain an over- 
whelming Slav population, has grown 
stronger with the years since the trea- 
ty of Versailles, and has been intensi- | 
fied by the recent loss of most of. the ; 
coal mines of Upper Silesia. | 

If French troops were withdrawn 
within the frontiers of France, then 
it is almost beyond debate that at no 
distant time’ German troops would go 
into Poland, while bolshevist troops 
would attack from the east. But who 
c 1 deny that a quarter of a century 
hence, German conditions. might be 
that an attack upon a strong 
Poland of 40,000,000 of inhabitants 
still assured of French support and 
backed by a still more powerful Cgecho. 
Slovakia would seem unwise. 

Anyhow, the fact . stands. The 
French. mean to defend the, Europe 
that is now revealed by e map. 
They haye given their support to the 
maintenance of the independence and ° 
the increase of the strength of the: 
nationalities which emerged 
from the sform and stress of the world 
war. They believe that a few years 
of effort may transform these states 
into going nations and that then the 
permanence of the new Europe. will 
be assured. But for a long time to 
coine this new Europe will necessarily 
need support and the young states will 
need to have strone armies, supple-

the fact that Russian anarchy has de-| 
prived her of the Russian markets in

markets, 


What the British would like to do 
is to get the economic machine to work 
anc first of all.to get the Getman ma- 
chine to work. The whole British idea 
is bottomed on the before-the-war sit- 
uation in which all of central Europe 
was economically tributary to Ger- 
many, who prayed the part of middle | 
man for much of British trade. Keynes, | 
in his famous or notorious book, out- 
lined a system of/ economic suprem- | 
acy for Germany in middie Europe ' 
which amounted to a restoration of 
the old Mitteleuropa of German propa- 
ganda. 

As to the aspirations of the “sue- 
cession states,” these have never 
awakened. sympathy in. Britain, I 
mean in British foreign office quar-* 
ters, for these succession states con- 
stitute a barrier te the speedy recon- 
struction of economic life. ou have 

sany new frontiers, much subdivision 

of territories, much economic rival- 
ry. Political frontiers do not in the 
least coincide with old economic uni- 
tie: and, if the present system endures 
not only will all recovery be slow, ‘but 
much of the old situation will never 
return, 

So the British have shown fthéem- 
selves netly hostile to Polish expan- 
sion, they have been severe critics of 
Czecho-Slovak expansion, they have 
shown little approval of the extension 
of Rumania to the Dniester and only 
a little more regard for the Adriatic 
ambitions of the southern Slavs. The 
only nation whose imperialism has in- 
terested them has been the Greeks. 
whose .campaigns in Asia have had 
British backing. But this interest 
is only because in the Near East Greek

these chdnges wouid mean much, very 
much, in the way of facilitating eco- 
nomie development. A Europe thus

only economic considerations counted 
or eounted most in this world of ours, 
it would be a natural evolut.on. 

Bat in such a Europe the sural 
peoples who have just com: to liberty 
would slowly but surely sink into rew 
servitude. Poland would again be 
divided between the Germans and the 
Russians, the Czechs would again come 
under German-Prussian this time in- 
stead of Austrian control. Rumania 
would be even more subservient to Ber- 
lin than she ‘was before the world war, 
and the Latins of Bessarabia would go 
back to Russia. Ia a word, political 
liberty would be sacrificed to economic 
efficiencv. This is what the applica- 
tion of British ideas would mean. 

And in such a nnew Europe, which 
would be in reality a reversion to the 
old, with the Austrian empire of yes- 
terday largely assigned to Germany, 
France trould share the fate of the 
nationalities of the “succession states,”

FRENCH AIM ~ : 

iS SAFE EUROPE. ; 
France has set out to make Europe 

safe for her own people and for the 


smaller peoples, because if she can 
pull the new states through their first 
years, she believes they vill presently 
be able to work alone anid when that 
day comes. the danger of German at- 
tack upon France, of German domina- 
tion in Europe will have vanished, 
Her army is the insurance of the 
small states, but their armies are a 
detail in the scheme and-a present aid 
to France in case of German aggres- 


sion. 

Britain would disband the armies, 
bring economic system back at the 
sacrifice of national instincts. She 
would open the ways to commerce at 
the expense of the patriotic hopes of; 
the several nations which have just 
won free of tyranny and are painfully 
at work erecting national] foundations. 
If the French system prevails Britain 
will suffer a terrible diminution in 
population and prosperity. Millions 
of her people will have to migrate be- 
cause they can no longer find work 
at home. But \if the British policy 

revails, Poland,’ Rumania, Czecho- 

lovakia and Jugo-Slavia may endure 
but a brief time and the French stay 
on the Rhine be measured by a few 
years. 

Britain sees Europe as an economic 
problem, France as a political prob- 
lem. The British solution seems tc 
France to promise political ruin, not 
only to France but te all the smaller 
nationalities, vho see the thing as do 
the French. But the British see that

if the French view prevails. if the 
French army continues to: hold the 


get strength but postpone economic re- 
construction, then the outlook for 
Britain is grim in the extreme. 
Hence it must be obvious that it 
will not be easy to break the Ffench 
position, France has her army, she 
has her Polish alliance and Poland is 
united with many of the other states 
by interlocking alliances. For three 
years the British have sought to 
break the French holds. They tried’ 
at Paris, they tried even* harder in

British to. be one promise of escape 
from their own present terrible plight. 

The _truth, not very clearly per- 
ceived in America, is that the French 
have the British by the throat. France 
is recovering from the war quite rap- 
idly, Britain is not, because French re- 
covery depends upon France alcune, 
while British recevery depends ‘ipon 
the restoration of economie order in 
coujitries far outside pf British cen- 
trol. To a considerable extent France 
can postpone such recovery, to a cer- 
tnin degree her policy prohibits such 


recovery, since the rise of the separate. 


states who are in a degree her wards 
precludes any restoartion of economic 
unity in any useful time. If France 
persists. if Britain can not aione or 
with the aid of America, shake French 
policy, then Brita##must fight Frence 
or bny her off. This is the cold fect. 


The war between France and Brit- 


of | ain today is*really as much a matter 


of life and «leath for Britain as the war 
between Britain and Germany a few 
years ago. , It is not a war of arms, 
but a war of policies. So far the ad- 
vantage has n with France, for 
France has managed to defend her 
policy and maintain it. She has her 
army and she has it on the Rhine. 
Germany is at her merey and scattered

Wherefore it is rather refreshing to 
read this account of a literary set-to 
between Alfred, Lerd Tennyson and 
Bulwer, Lord Lytton which was pub- 
lised in The Constitution of January 
5, 1872. In this the author of “the 


euses Tennyson of borrowing the 
style of Wordsworth ' and Keats and 
having a pen attainted with femninity,

more than coronets” takes his rival

him curtly by terming him “bandbox”

Somebody writes an article re-

interesting particulars of both. 

Bulwer was disappointed that 
he was not appointed Poet Laur- 
ence of England and in his “New 
Timon” he thus raspis Tennyson, 
his successful competitor : 


I seek no purpled prettiness of

A soul in earnest scorns

Following is an outline of the foun- 
dation, made by the executive commit- 
tee: ; 
“A national committee of 250 repre- 
sentative men and women has under- 
taken to establish the Woodrow Wil- 
son Foundation. The purpose of the 
foundation is to honor a great Ameri- 
can and to create a method whereby 
public service will be encouraged, and 
conspicuously recognized in this and 
future generations. 
»“From the income of the foundation, 
the Woodrow Wilson award or awards 
will be granted in recognition of dis- 
tinguished public service. 

Popular Subscription. 

_“To establish this foundation on a 
fitting basis, the national committee, 
through an organization in each state, 


will make an appeal for.a ular. sub- 
scription. The vamiount & Phe funa|

ocratic principles. ~Woodrow Wil- 
son has soe conspicuously championed, 
and who wish to perpetuate the in- 
tluence of America’s great leader. 
“After the fund has been raised a 
board of trustees, composed of emi- 
nent Americans, will be entrusted 
with its permanent administration. 

“The active campaign throughout 
the country will begin the week of 
January 15, 1922. Subscriptions, 
however, will be received at any time 
at national headquarters. Checks may 

made payable to the Woodrow 
Wilson Foundation.” 

The Atlanta committee issued a 
Statement Saturday calling oa all 
Georgians to join in the movement to 
honor the former president and to 
establish a foundation to ‘provide per- 
petual awards for distinguished pub- 
lic service. 


Married Georgia Woman. 

It — — out by the Atlanta 
committee that Georgia is closely re- 
lated to the former presiilent as menh 
of his early life was spent in this 
state. it is recalled that the former 
president practiced law in Georgia for 
several years, part of the time being 
spent in Atlanta. It was pvinted out 
that he married a Georgia woman, was 
partly educated in Georgia, and prob- 
ably was as much a citizen of Georgia 
as of Virginia or New Jersey, in which 
saa t eon a his career. 

e committee states that Woodrow 
Wilson virtually began his career in 
Atlanta, and that this city now has a 
great opportunity to honor the former 
president by subscribing quickly the 
amount allotted to Atlanta. 

Following is the statement of the 
Atlanta committee : 

‘Georgia's quota of the million- 
dollar Woodrow Wilson foundation 
fund is $35,000, that of Atlanta is 
$14,750. No portion of- this fund 
will be used for campaign expenses 
and former President Wilson persona!- 
ly will not be its beneficiary. Every 
dollar will be used in providing suit- 
able awards, from time to time, to in- 
dividuals or groups of individuals who 
may perform some notable service to 
mankind. 

“Mr. Wilson, though born in Vir- 
ginia, was a resident of Georgia, was 


ried in Georgia to a Georgia woman 
who was a rare type of southern 
womanhood. From a young practi- 
tioner of law he has become the fore- 
most statesman the world, and his 
achievements for his country and man- 
kind have no precedent, perhaps, ex- 
cept in those of the immortal Wash- 
ington. 
Appeals to Georgians. 

“This plan, therefore, to honor Mr. 

ilson re mankind to nobler 
resolves and a loftier citizenship, ap- 
peals with striking force to all Geor- 


g1ans, 

“It is the wish of the Atlanta com- 
mittee that every man, woman and 
child in Georgia may participate in 
this great memorial to a great man, 
once a citizen of this great state. The 
name of each person who contributes 
to this memorial, whether a dollar or 
a hundred dollars, will by inscribed

Plans Are Complete 
For Annual Session 
Of Local Merchants 


Plans are completed for the an-’ 
nual meeting of the Atlanta Retail 


Merchants’ association .to be. held |2 


Thursday evening, January 26, at 


7 o'clock at the Capital club. . 
The regular program will be preceded | § 


by an elegant dinner. From responses 
that have come into the asseciation’s 
office in the Connally building, at 
least two hundred members and in- 
vited guests are expected to be pres- 
ent. 

Governor Hardwick will deliver the 
principal address of the evening, 
which will deal largely with the part 
played by retail merchants in the 
financial, economie and civic affairs 
of Georgia. In addition, the busi- 
ness forecast for 1922 from a local 
and national standpoint will be dis- 


cussed by three of the ablest busi- | 
‘ness men picked from the membership 


of the association. They are D. C. 
Black, president, of the Atlanta Au- 
tomobile association; Winship Nun- 
nally, president of the Nunnally Can- 
dy company, and W. W. Orr, chair- 
man of the board of the George Muse} 
Clothing company. An excellent mu- 
sical program and several brief en- 
tertainment features will be intro- 
duced during the dinner, after which 
yore a number of valuablé prizes,: 

nated by members of the associa- 
tion, will be drawn for. , 

The nominating committee appoint- | 
ed sometime ago to suggest officers 
for the ensuing year will make their 
recommendations to the meeting, after’ 
which newly-elected officers will be 
installed. Reports of President Ivan 
E. Allen and Secretary C. V. Hohen- 
stein covering the work of the asso- 
ciation for 1921 will be brief, but 
illuminating, suggesting the promo- 
tion and execution of certain definite 
plans intended to broaden the asso- 
ciation’s scope of activity and increase 
the value of its service to the mem- 
bers individually and collectively.

Last Season’s Unqualified Hit 
Begins Engagement Here 
Monday Night. 


Wise ~ Fools,” 


“Three Austin 


“Strong's brilliant comedy, which made 


such an unqualified hit when present- 
ed here last season, will again be reen 
at the Atlanta theater tomorrow 
(Monday) night, whtn it will begin 
an ‘engagement of three nights and 
Wednesday matinee. ; 

This is the only company on tour. 
i nder the management of John Gold- 
en, producer of “Lightnin’,” “The 
Virst Year,” “Dear Me,” “Turn to the 
tight,” “Thank You,” and other suc- 
cesses, it established a record of 333 
consecutive performances at the “ri- 
‘erion theafer in New York city, with 
both lengthy runs and repeat engzege- 
ments in Chicago and Boston. 

The story is unique. The three wise 
fools are three old cronies who live 
together in a fashionable house in 
Washington square, New York, once 


the residential section of Gotham’s 


most exclusive personages, These 
three old chaps, one a retired finan- 
cier, one a physician and one a .aw- 
yer, live by rote. They have a regular 
time for doing everything; they drink 
a glass of hot milk at a stipulated hour 
each night; they eat an apple at a cer- 
tain minute each evening; they play 
solitare at a regular time each day, 
and they have certain dishes served at 
each meal during each day of the week. 
They simply live in the past, holding 
sacred the memory of one girl, who 
was wooed and lost by each when they 
were lads. So -the three staid, ccn- 
servative men. become. upon this one 
topic three wise fools. 

The arrival of a young ward, be- 
queathed them by a dying mother, 
their old sweetheart, reyolutionizes 
their mode of living. and transforms 
them. The many dramatic incidents 
and startling surprises make the com- 
edy vividly interesting. 

Much of the charm of the play is 
in the superlative comedy acting of 
John W. Ransone, famous as the orig- 
inal Hans Wagner in “The Prince of 
Pilsen ;” the personality of Hazel 
Sexton, and the general excellence of 
be cant of players sent here by Mr. 
voiden,

Musical Success “Margie.” 

“Margie,” claimed as the reigning 
musical comedy success of two conti- 
nents, which is underlined at the At- 
Janta theater for Thursday night, 
when it will begin an angagement of 
three nights and Saturday matinee, is 
said to be the last word in life, ginger, 
pep and vitality. A large cast of young 
and talented artists is headed by El- 
mer Coudy, whose clean, snappy and 
original comedy methods are good for 
a hearty laugh every 30 seconds. Mr. 
Coudy’s success in “Margie” has been 
such that he is now listed among the 
ten funniest men on the American 
speaking stage. “Margie” unfolds a 
story of sweet simplicity. It is beau- 
tifully staged and embellished with a 
number of spectacular features. Seats 


for the epgagement- ane now on- sale. 


Popular ces will prevail.

LYRIC HEADLINER} 


Authoress of Short Stories to 
Present Farcical Skit, 
“Eloping.” 


’ Lilly Dean Hart, who is the author- 
ess of many delightful -short stories 
and:-clever acts, was so enraptured 
with her latest brainchild that she de- 


cided to use it as a vehicle for herself 
and her partner, Wilfred Berrick. 
“Eloping” /is the title, and the trials 
of a youthful bride and groom the 
main issue. Jt is farcical and at the 
same time melodious and dainty 
enough to please the most fastidious. 
The Lyric management has secured it 
as the principal feature Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Barto and Clark are going to make 
you familiar with certain qualities 
that Columbia and Victor never pos- 
sessed heretofore. This is,described 
as vaudeville’s latest novelty, there- 
fore it would not be fair te vaudeville 
Dy pas orcs it. But it’s a great little 
act. : 

Dick Duffy and Adel Kellar in “Via 
Telephone,” have a distinct oddity, 
with unusual appeal. It’s brimful of 
comedy and tunefulness besides, which 
makes it a splendid contrast for the 
act. that follows, which is Bill Orutch- 
field, a breezé from the west. Out 
west now they punch cattle with au- 
tomobiles, but there are rtill a few 
of the cowboys left, though there is 
a chance that there are really .more 
on the stage than there are on the 
plains. -However, Crutchfield is bona 
fide. He knows how to handle a rope, 
and when it comes to stirring up 
laughs, he is a regular tornado. 

Gene and Minetti are two charming 
young ladies who term themselves 
merely “singing girls.” But they are 
ever so much more than that. They 
are daintily gowned bits of fluffiness, 
endowed with exceptional voices and 
personalities who lull your cares with 
appealing melodies. 


SOUSA’S BIG BAND, 


LARGEST EN TOUR, 
_ TO VISIT ATLANTA 


The biggest brass band which ever 


made a tour is that of John Philip 
Sousa, the “March. King,” which is 
scheduled for a visit to Atlanta on 
February 20. It was considered a big 
band when it played at the old Cotton 
States exposition in Atlanta and 
boasted 50—count ’em, 50—musi- 
cians. But now it has doubled that 
number. Lieutenant John Philip 
Sousa, it is said, has trimmed off his 
famous beard and laid aside some of 
the medals which made him look like 
a traveling jewelry store, but he has 
lost ngne of his old time pep, accord- 
ing to newspaper reviews of his con- 
certs in other cities. 

Though he plays excellent music 
and is by no means afraid to cope with 
the most intricate of the “classical” 
compositions, Lieutenant Sousa, it is 
said, recognizes that a brass band au-~- 
dience is distinctly one of “the peope,” 
and that his first mission is to delight 
anid entertain. So his programs are 
brimming over with “tunes,” the stir- 


ring Sousa marches, hits from the 
famous. musical comedies, “stunt”

“Getting It Over.” a surprise musi- 
eal farce, is to be the headline vaude- 
ville attraction at Loew’s Grand ‘the- 
ater.Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
This is an offering that, while it will 
appeal to all lovers of good vaudeville, 
will particuarly interest the Ameri- 
can Legion and the boys of the Amer- 


ican expeditionary forces who served 
their country in France during the 
late war, as it is presented by the 
original soldier stars of the two 
Broadway musical successes, “You 
Know Me Al” and “Let's Beat It,” 
with bits and pieces as originally pro- 
duced by the Twenty-Seventh Divi- 
sional show. 

Bight soldier stars of the 27th divi- 
sion will offer a miniature musical 
comedy, “Getting It Over,” and there 
will be nothing in it except the sol- 
dier stars themselves to remind tlie 
audience of the late war. ‘These boys 
put it over for their fellow soldiers 
in France and as the soldiers were 
fed up enough on the war hardships, 
naturally their stunts were designedly 
civilian in character. Their show is 
a regular he-act. All the chorus girls 
in reality are soldier boys, and they 
have scored a tremendous hit over 
the Loew circuit. They all have seen 
service with the 27th division and the 
national guard, while two of the boys 
were wounded, and two were cited for 
bravery. The cast includes Daniel 
Burns, B. A. Crawford, Joseph Cloon- 
ey, Andrew Fitzpatrick, Ned Bolles, 
Ted Fisher, Emmett. DuVal, Ralph 
DeF ree. : 

An extra feature on this program 
is the chubby comedienne, Josephine 
Harmon, in “A Bit of Gab,” a re- 


| stricted repertoire of songs and say- 


‘ings, written especially for her by 
Alber Von Tilzer, and Neville Fleeson. 
Ofher acts will include, Herbert 


|| Hodge and Mildred Howell, in their 


amusing rural classic, “Object Matri- 
mony,’, @ humorous skit, introduc- 
ing melodies, fun and dances. 

Ulis and Clark, in a joyful combina- 
tion of personality and songs, Foley 
and Spartan, versatile gymnasts, in 
sensational series of amazing physical 
exploits. 

Featured on the long list of screen 
attractions, which includes new film 
comedies and Loew’s Weekly News 
and Views, is a smashing big feature 
picture, William Kussell, in “The 
Roof Tree,’ a romance of the south. 
The picture depends on dramatic in- 
terest entirely for its big scenes. It 
is a story of the old time feud days 
of Kentucky and was written by a 


lfamous author, Charles Neville Buck.

successes, has John Golden entrusted 
the important role of Sidney Fairchild 
in “3 Wise Fools,” to be seen at 
the Atlanta theater tomorrow (Mon- 
day) night, when begins an engage- 
ment of three nights and Wednesday 
matinee. 

Miss Sexton appeared in Boston, 
Pifiladelphia and. othér ‘important 
cities where the play was presented 
last season, and the enthusiastic praise 
that reviewers have accorded her has 
forecasted stellar honors for the young 
woman within the next few years. In 

Mr. Golden-is now in search of 
a new play in which her talent will 
have full range, as it has in “2 Wise 


with a good singing voice, caused her 
to select musical comedy for her debut 
and to that end she studied both voice 
and piano culture in New York with 
Eugene Bernstein and other prominent 


teachers. Heredity asserted itself, 
however, and this plan was abandoned 
when she had an opportunity to join 
a dramatic stock company. 


In “3 Wise Fools’ Miss Sexton 
has just the sort of role that gladdens 
the heart of a young, ambition player. 
It exacts the, full powers of a sea- 
soned emotioan! actress as well as the 
tender charm of the ingenue. In its 
mixture of thrills and heart throbs 


pation makers in this picture proves, 
that. 


William Farnum opened his Sag 
Harbor, L. I., home over Christmas. 
He had a Christmas tree for the poor 
children of the village, and a big din- 
ner for them. 


the play runs the gamut of human 


orphan, who is adopted by the three 
old admirers of her mother, is the 
pivot of most of the action. Austin 
Strong, the playwright, has written 


a part as’ well as a play that ranks 
with the classics.

ONLY THEATER IN THE 
CITY "SHOWING. FIRST 


RUN PICTURES AT 


LIONEL WEST, HIMSELF. 
ON CRITERION STAGE 


Screen Athlete Here in ‘Per- 
son and in Photoplay 
Romance. 


A Georgia boy who went from the 


suceess in both is the headline attrac- 
tion at the Criterion theater this week. 


'He is Lionel West, perhaps. better 


known to his friends in. Georgia as 
“Bill,” one tinfe on the Mercer varsity 
football team, later one of the most 
enthusiastic members of the. Tech 
squad and still later a successful 
candidate for the coveted “C” of the 
University of California. Lionel 
West's record is one of ambition, hard 
work and achievement. He began 


This athletic career in Macon in 1910, 


when he won the mile race at Mercer 
against a field of trained runners. 
That same year he made the varsity 
team. When he came to Georgia 
Tech he did not have a chance to make 
the varsity because of’ the one-year 


gridiron to motion pictures and found 


rule then in effett. But he had some | 
good training under Coach Heisman 
and Assistant Coach Alexander, and 
he has remained a great Tech booster. 
When, in 1917, after nearly five 
years’ absence from the gridiron, he 
entered the University of Coline 
and was one of elevén successful 
candidates for varsity he scored one 
of the greatest “comebacks” in the 
history of athletics. 


When he turned to motion pictures 
Lionel West sought. the roles giving 
expression to his love of athletics. 
He has staged many a fight before the 
camera—and not a tame affair, either. 
He is physically fit, he keeps in con- 
dition, he is husky and strong. Dur- 
ing his picture experience he has stood 
un for a total of More than seventy 
rounds with Jack Dempsey. It was 
Lionel West who consented to enter 
the ring against the champion for the 
fight scenes of “Daredevil Jack,” the 
serial picture featuring Jack Demp- 
sey, and for nine days while the cam- 
eras clicked away he matched his | 
prowess with that of the woerld’s 

‘ampion. 
wus Mr. West appears in person 
at the Criterion his act will be jn- 
troduced by a short. reel covering 4 
boxing exhibition between himself and 
Champion Jack Dempsey. : 

In addition to this the feature juc- 
ture for the week is one in waic

The Alamo No..2 theater will show 
another splendid picture on Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday, Bebe Dan- 
iels in ‘The Speed Girl.” -Many peo- 
ple claim that it is the best thing 
that Miss Daniels has ever done for 
the screen as she is the living essence 
of speed, the principle ingredient of 
“The Speed Girl.” Married folks and 
single ones as well will thoroughly en- 
joy the picture as it shows Bebe Dan- 
iels in her most charming moods and 
introduces many extremely humorous 
situations. As an added attraction 
the management has secured for these 
three days a Christie two-reel comedy, 
“Pure and Simple,” with Bobby. Ver- 
non playing the leading role. 

For the nee of the week, Rud- 
yard Kipling’s “Without Benefit of 
Clergy” will be offered on Thursday

“THE ROOF TREE,” 
AT LOEW’S GRAND, 
STARS WM. RUSSELL 


_ An excellent picture with a favor- 
‘ite star is promised at Loew’s Grand 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 
where William Russell will be seen 
in “The Roof Tree,” his latest Fox 
picture. Charles Neville Buek, fa- 
mous writer, whose favorite themes 
are romances of the south, wrote the 
story and Jack Dillon directed the 
picture. Pretty Sylvia Breamer sup- 
ports Mr. Russell as a Kentucky 
mourtain girl. 

“The Roof Tree’ is said to be a 
very strange and exceedingly dramatic 
tale of love and hatred in which a 
magnificent roof tree and its senti- 
mental tradition are importantly ¢on- 
nected. Russell is seen as a Virginian 
who flees te Kentucky after the mur- 
der of his sister's husband. How he 
falls in love with the Kentucky belle 
and thereby arouses firece jealousy 
in the heart of a mountaineer is said 
to be told in an extremely interest- 
ing way.

on the statue. 


in “Shattered Dreams,” the Univer- 
sal photodrama which will bring Miss 
du Pont to the Tudor theater Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday in the stel- 
lar role, the star impersonates a beau- 
tiful art student in the Latin quarter 
of Paris, a sculptress, who searches 
tirelessly for a model for the statue 
she wishes to make of an Apache. 

Then she finds him, unexpectedly, 
mysteriously. And works with him 


completed. 

But after it is finished, for a strong 
reason it is displeasing to her. And 
suddenly her hatred becomes so in- 
tense that she breaks the statué to 
pieces. 

It’s a good picture of the artist's 
temperament, 

And a better picture of Paris. The 
Paris of the cafes, bright and alluring, 
and the Paris of the Apache’s un- 


didness. 

Opposite Miss du Pont Herbert 
Heyes plays the masculine. lead. ' He 
appears as the Apache, the wreck of 
a man who went to the war with 
hope high in his heart. 

Other actors supporting Miss du 
Pont aré Bertram Grassby, J. A. Koi, 
Earl Lee, Eric Mayne, Hugene Corey 
and Hector Sarno. 

Paul Seardon directed the picture 
from a scenario ‘based on a book by 
Maude Annesley. 

The dress of the Apache is some- 
thihg to be marveled at—a costume 


'primitjye in its significance, weirdly 


striking in its appearance. 

The true denizen of subterranean 
Paris wears a short black velvet jack- 
et with big patch pockets, and under- 
neath a white shirt. At all times he 
wears a silk handkerchief about his 
neck, for there is a certain fear 
among these people that they will 
eatch cold—and no wonder considering 
how damp and sunless their haunts 
are, two or three stories under the 
ground. The handkerchief is black, 
and so is the packet, and their long 
velvet peg-top trousers, and the silk 
girdle about their waists. 


She goes the flappers one better! 
Does Wanda Hawley, Paramount

~ ENCHANTMENT” in 


S* SOREN AT RINTO 


Marion Davies Plays Lead- 
‘ing Role in Elaborately — 
Staged Drama. 


4° 


It all looks so stinete on the screen 
that one arm to see a picture and 
either G27 “I like it” or “I don't 
like it.¥ - For the outsder it is difficult 
to appreciate the mammoth work and 
foresight, the seeking for effects, the 
imagination and the tireless efforts 
that accomapny the making of a pho- 
toplay. 

But these are tremendously interest- 
ing factors,, and every!siy who visitsa 
inetion picture studio for the first’ 
time, gets the thrill of his life when 
it begins to dawn on him what-an 
umount of work and artistry goes into 
a “‘movie.’ 


For instance, in “Enchantment,” 
Cosmopolitan Productions’ ‘latest pic- 
ture, chyring * Marion Davies, which 
comes to the Rialto theater tomorrow, 
a whole theater was constructed so 
that.a short episode of “The Taming 
of the Shrew” might be accurately 
staged. To the audience that is bound 
to look “pretty” and “well done,” but 
the average spectator has no concep- 
tion of the frees that were at work 
so that Shakespeare might be pre- 
sented in the most authnetic manner. 

The scene from Shakespeare’s com- 
edy is germaine to the story, because 
the father of the girl of the story gets 
the idea while watching the play of 

“taming” his own daughter. Marion 
Davies plays the part ‘of Ethel Hoyt, 
r spoiled pg “flapper,” and Tom 
Lewis, as her father, decides to cure 
her of high spirit. 

The second play within ap lay (for 
there are two in. this picture) is a 
modern society pageant, taken from 
the old fairy tale, “The Sleeping 
fjenunty.” Another gorgeous stage 
was errected, done in all the sumptu- 
ousness of a royal family’s abode in 
fairyland. The architecture is a mix- 
ture chiefly of Byzantine and Gothie. 

Still another interesting setting is a 
restaurant. It is complete with four 
sides, the dancing floor, eating section,

waiters, food, et al., down to the steam- 
ing tea, which, between dances, is 
consumed in all its cold fragrance. 

It is these things—these quests for 
effects—which seem so natural on the 
stage, that give the fascination of pic- 
ture-making. to director, players and 
nll directly concerned. And it is these 
things today which the audience wants 
to hear about, for a picture itself is 
no longer a novel thing to motion pice 
ture fans.

Personal A ppearance : 


Of ‘Lew Cody on the 
Metropolitan Stage 


A great many things we are apt to 
think about motion picture players 
are held for naught when you meet 
stars like Lew Cody, debonnaire idol 
of many fans who is t6 appear in 
person at the Metropolitan theater all 
this week, 

In his tour Lew Cody is making an 


earnest effort to fit himself even 
better for the business of enterting 
His Majesty, the American Public. 
He has.an ambition and is touring 
the country to fortify it and make it 
bear the fruit of success. He is striv- 
ing to learn what the public wants 
from Lew Cody and is even pre 
to change his entire course and the 
type of. pictures he. has .made.in - the 
past. The star is a four-square, six- 
footer who agrees with the belief that 
there is no better work for a regular 
fellow than bringing happiness to the 
world through the medium of the 
silver sheet. Incidentally he has some 
odd recipes for keeping himself re y. 
For instance, Be confesses @ afiing 
for phonographs aad always pe 
one with him wherever he goes. 

y is death to many of the pet 
notions about picture makers and pro- 
tests at the misbranding of actors and 
actresses for their matrimonial short- 
comings. 

“Look into any set of we about 
you and you will find the divorce 
courts overwhelmingly greater than in 
the motion picture colony, where 
exists some of the most pretty ro- 
mances in the world. But our people 


bles are magnified by repetition.” 


Ask Ma—She Knows. 


“ William Desmond, whose production 
of “Fightin’ Mad” is scoring a sensa- 
tional sticcess in its Metro release, 
tells this story illustrating the trials 
of a screen star: He was standing 
on the deck of transatlantic liner when 
a little girl, who had been sitting with 
her mother in a steamer chair, came 
up to him and asked: “Are you an 
actor?’ Mr. Desmond admitted that 
he was. “What's your name?” the 
girl continued. She was told. The 
inguisitive child went on, asking him 
his age, whether he was married and 
other personal questions. 

“Anything else?’ Mr. Desmond 
asked. The child turned to her moth- 
er. “What else did you want to seated 
mother?” she asked. 


Gloria Swanson, Paramount star, | he 
now engaged upon “Beyond the 
Rocks,” by Elinor Glyn, under Sam 
Wood’s direction, was well remember- 
ed by Santa Claus at Christmas, but 
one of the most useful gifts received 
was a folding makeup table. The 
ingenious contrivance looks like a suit 
case of polished wood until opened up. 
Then it develops four legs, a mirror, 
a top with space for any amount 
of material, and, in fact, all the con-| 
table. On 
location it is the best thing that has 
been found to date. |

HEY were playing the jazz. The 
lights were down. I didn’t fall 
much for the fellow, judge, but— 
oh, the jazz got me! I closed my 
eyes and let myself go—. That's 
the way it started, judge. The 
music done it.” 

A weepy story like this it is 
‘that Judge Lindsay, of Denver, says un- 
fortunate girls, their young lives wrecked 
by the jazz fire that is consuming the 
minds and morals of at least part of this 
generation, narrates to 
him these days. 

Doctors are even going 
further than judges in 
their condemnation of the 
jazz fever. “If jazz is not 
stopped we will have no 
more clean-ginded chil- 
dren. Even our babies 
are being sullied and en- 
nervated -by the jazz mu- 
sic, the shimmying and 
the general looseness of 
eactions, they. see. about 
them,” doctors proclaim. 

“Danger! Stop!” Mrs. 
Oberndorfer, national mu- 
sic chairman of the Gen- 
eral Federation of Wom- 
en’s Clubs, cries. “Think. 
What ifistincts’ are being 
vicariously aroused by 
this jazz? 

Any adult who has at- 
tended recently a dance 
of young people in their 
teens and early twenties, 
at public dance hall, at 
country club, even at a 
private home—who has 
witnessed corsetless girls, 
clamped tightly to over- 
héated partners, eyes 
closed as if asleep, 
lips humming suggestively 
with raggy rhythm .and

means of good music—brought back to 
normal health and state of mind. 

Stand on any busy city street and 
watch the jazz faces among the young 
people who pass. The sophisticated faces 
of .fifteen-year-olds. Faces over which all 
the emotions of maturity have passed. 
Artificial intensity, the result of living and 
especially “emoting” at high pressure, is 
mirrored there. A super-strenuosity, 


nervous, almost hysterical, shows itself in’ 


walk, gestures, in voice, in all actions. 


The passion to be always on the ge, the 
desire to be always in a high-keyed ca- 
citement, to be keenly alive even theugh 
— stimulated, and to live much, even 


though indiscriminately, is the mental 
world in which nlany are now living. © 
The jazz music starts it, they say. And 
then comes the desire for other kinds of 
excitement. It’s a speedy life that the 


“jazz baby” lives. A life empty mentally 
but riotously. crowded emotionally. 


Many American households are inhab- 


- ited by jazz babies of both sexes, old and 


young, though most of them are between . 
the ages of sixteen and twenty-five. Pro- 
fessor Burges Johnson, of Vassar college, 
Says the loss of mental stability in them 
is due to “the wave of individual freedom 
that has swept over the world in the last 
few years,” and the consequent relaxing 
in family discipline. 


“Enjoy life” is the jazz motto. Danc- 
ing intimately in the dark, carrying a hip 
flask, going “bumming” in the motor, un- 


- ehaperoned, scorning the conventions in 


every way, vulgarizing the emotions that 


should be kept most sacred, eating, drink- 
ing, camel-walking, living in the material 
and sensual and forgetting the apirnuel-* 
such is “enjoying life.” 


It’s a retrogression. Back to the mon 
key. That’s individual fredeom.

Tommy or fifteen-year-old Anne? 
Haven’t Tommy and Anne just as good

of course, tO suggest that the

Some Choice Bits of Jazz. 


POONING while dancing is seven- 

eighths of the thrill. -And no wonder 
when the jazz songs are written to words 
like the following, taken at random from 
popular dance songs: 


Pm beside him, 
Mercy, let his conscience guide him. 


Ma, ’'m meeting with resistance, 
J shall holier for assistance, 
Ma! He’s kissing me. 


Them that love and run away 
Live to love another , day. 


Now I ain’t handsome, I ain't sweet, 
-But Pve got a brand of lovin’ that can’t be 
beat. 


When I wanna,.you no wanna; 
But 1 wanna what l wanna when I wanna. 


As fer emotional excitement generated 
by jazz, imagine the syncopated clang and 
batter, the barbaric clater and rhythm 
that accompany these words: 


Get hot, shake your shoulder, 
Get hot, get a litile bolder. 
You will have your way 
If you make him follow and say, 
Get hot, step right on ’em, 
it’s hot, step right on ‘em. 
Don't be siow, 
' Just go get a beau 
And yell, “Get hot.” 
And here’s another song, “Spread Your 
Stuff.” that music store men deciare sells 
quickly to the jazz crowd: 


First knock yo knees, Hon, with nie, 
Then — aroun like a ered that’s lost at 


- Get ny Hon, don’t make a bluff, 

Because you, | can’t get enough, 

Ok, Honey, come on, spread your stuff.

Another gem of jazz, the answer to the 
question formulated therein being phy- 
ehologically correct: 
Gliding surely is divine, 
Still, what makes you shiver every time! 
Tain't nothin’ cise but jazz.>

The “blues”—that’s. another type of 
jazz. Mrs. Oberndorfer classifies these as 
ennervators, as atrophiers of the rational 
balance. 

“The softer you play the “bine’ pieces, 
the funnier the crowd gets,” a member 
of a dance orchestra informs me. “In my 
opinion it isn’t the loud, boisterous dance 
music that makes people lose their re- 
serve, it’s the slow, soft, masty syncopa- 
tion; the whining, the slurring and the 
crying of the saxaphone seems tj get the 
dancers.

stimulation even more. 


Detroit have discovered abdominal or hip 
dancing, a type of exercise that may more 
modestly and with more propriety be done 
one by one in the gymnasium than two by 
two at the ball:

The Strange Story of the 


Sunday, January 15, 1922 


House of Plenty 
in Which the Wife and 
“Children. Mysteriously 
Were Denied the Luxu- 
ries for Which They 
Longed. | 


HE afternoon was clear and 
bright, with the snap of coming 
frost in the air; women were in 
their autumn. clothes — slimly 
built, soft -garmente decked 
with embroideries and rich f rs; 
shops were displaying their 
most alluring wares, and every 

florist’s window held a brave display of 
chrysanthemums and scarlet leaves. The 
club year had opened with a luncheon, 


followed by a political talk by a brilliant: 


woman; new acquaintances had been 
made, old friends greeted after the sum- 
mer’s separation. - Eleanor Tyles had 
been part of it aH—she was the club's 
secretary that year—but as she walked 
homeward she was in a mood far from 
hapnrv 

slight and youthful figure for all her 
thirty-six years, she walked slowly, loiter- 
ing now and again before some shop win- 
dow, gloom in hef eyes and a sense of 
unfairness in her heart. Every other 
woman in that great room except herself 
had been well dressed; every other wom- 
an had hai a touch of smartness and 
freshness about her. Only she had been 
dowdy—yes, dowdy, shabby, in her plain 
suit four years old, and the hat that had 
done more than good service for three 
winters, and which showed it, -in spite of 
all she had been able to do to it. 

Without losing consciousness of self, 
her thoughts passed on to the children. 
Betty, at 12, was just at the age where 
she needed pretty things; she was begin- 
ning to talk of what the other girls were 
wearing, to ask why she could not have 
the same. The two little Mercers, Anne 
and Peggy, her best friends, had new soft 
coats for the winter, with dainty bits of 
fur at neck and wrists. Try as she would, 
Eleanor had not been able to contrive any- 
thing really nice for Betty out of her own 
black evening cloak with the tops of two 
silk petticoats for lining. And _ surely 
Frank Mercer made less than John! And 
Alan’s last winter clothes were absolutely 
outgrown, not fit to be seen even at the 
public schoo] to which he went—the pub- 
lic school itself another of her grievances. 

She paused in front of the plate glass 
window of a department store. There was 
a coat that would make Betty look ador- 
able, and a suit that would do for herself; 
it was perfectly plain, too—it could not be 
prohibitively expensive, even in these 
days of outrageous prices. 

On the way up the hill the motor cars 
of other clubwomen whirled by, carrying 
the lingerers to their homes. Some of 
them saw her and nodded; others were 
too absorbed in themselves to notice any 
one afoot—especially, she told herself 
bitterly, any one as shabby as herself. 
Not that they were snobs; they always 
went out of their way to make her feel 
that her clothes and the place she lived 
in and the fact of her not having a car 
of her own made no difference in the 
world to them; but she loathed their ef- 
forts, often so obvious, to be kind. Kind! 
~ She did not want anybody to be kind 
to her; she wanted her rights, what she 
ought to.h:ve, what there was no reason 
» in the world for her not having, no reason 
—except John’s penuriousness. 

That was the core of her trouble—for 
trouble it was, and of long standing. She 
chad never been able to understand it. She 
could look back on the earlier years of 
their marriage, when all was confidence 
and hope shared between them equally, 
as their anxieties were shared. 

They had been. poor in those days; 
they had nothing but John’s salary, and 
before they had dared to.marry at all they 
had frugally counted up every possible 
expense. But the salary was enough; she 
had made it enough, for she was a capable 
manager—she had had to be, the elder 
daughter of a family of four, with a 
wirlowed mother. 

When her mother died, the year Betty 
was born, there had been no question be- 
tween her brothers and herself. about the 
Ixttle that was left; it must, belong to 
Janet, of course, the delicate” unmarried 
sister. John’s family consisted solely of 
a maiden aunt in a’ Vermont village; he 
had inherited enough to see him through 
college, and no more. So there had-been 
no chance of their inheriting ing, no 
hope for any of those timely little wind- 
falls that frequently fell to other people; 
but it had not mattered. John’s’ salary 
had been increased the first year, and 
more than once since then. He held a 
responsible position now, and they could 
really afford almost anything that their 
friends had. Only—there was John, and 
the inexplicable change in him.

“OQ, John, I don’t understand, I don’t see how you could, how you — — could!” 


During those first years he had been so 


gay and generous, so brisk and alert. Lit- 
tle theater treats, little surprises of candy 
and small bits of jewelry; the pearl ring 
when Betty came; the little house that 
had been such a delight when they bought 
it—subject to a mortgage for half its value 
—and that now seemed so inadequate and 
undesirable, set as it was on the little side 
street. In those days, when they had first 
had the small amount more than they ac- 
tually needed to live on, he had opened a 
checking account in their joint names; 
she had known where every penny went, 
and she had made every penny count, too. 
That was the year before they bought the 
house; the second year after that the 
change began. She had never understood 
it; she felt that she never would. 

For it was hard to believe that mere 
prosperity could change him, her John; 
yet she could trace the cause to nothing 
else. She had not even learned of the 
large increase of salary until it had been 
in effect for months. What she had no- 
ticed, with her wifely attention to every- 
thing about him, was that John’s old be- 
loved sparkle seemed to have become dim- 
mer—gradually to-be sure. 


He walked the street more slowly, for- 
got his old habit of taking the stairs two 
or three at a time to snatch up Betty and 
toss her in the air. He had become quieter, 
older; more than once she asked him, with 
the tenderness that never failed to bring 
its response, whether he was anxious 
about anything. He always laughed at 
her, denied it; then at last he had, hesi- 
tatingly, to be sure, suggested their spend- 
ing less. He had spoken of saving. Well, 
she had spent Jess; she had -helped him 
save; what would she not do for him, her 
John, especially when he was anxious and 
worried? Why, it was sheer joy to make 
all the children’s things and her own: and 
while they were little and she had to be 
with them so closely it really mattered 


She was in his big chair now, and sobbing. 


- . 
very little what she wore, so long as she 
was dainty for John. 


Then had come the shock of finding 
out about his increased salary and the fact 
that he had kept it from her; Kept it from 
her, from her, his wife, who had done 
every last thing she could to he his true 
partner and helpmate. And to hear of it 
from a stranger! Yet so it had happened. 


She had met Mrs. Loring one afternoon 
at a little tea given by an old friend of 
her mother’s, met her with a shy, young 
respect for a woman so much older and 
of wealth and position so assured, and 
wife of the head of the firm that John 
worked for. ‘Mrs. Loring had smiled gra- 
ciously, rather singled her out to talk to, 
offered her a drive home in her limousine 
-——the first that Eleanor had ever stepped 
into. It was on. the way home that -+he 
revelation came. 


“I am very glad to have met you, my 
dear,” the older woman. said. “Now I shall 
have something to tell my husband! He 
is always telling me how much he thinks 
of yours.” , 

Hleanor flushed, and found nothing. to 
say. But apparently Mrs. Loring approved 
of that; she patted the younger woman’s 
hand. “When my John was the age of 
yours; my dear, he was no junior partner, 
let me tell you!” she said, “We'd have 
thought ourselves very rich with your in- 
come! But I’m glad to see that you take 
it sensible, That’s the right way, my dear, 
the way that gets on! One sees so much of 
the other thing nowadays!” 


With what enthusiasm had she met 
John that night, «nning to meet him with 
flushed cheeks and throwing her arms 
about his neck. “John! John! When did it 
happen? Isn’t it glorious? O, my Johnny 
boy, I'm so proud, proud, proud of you!” 

He had never before met her enthu- 
siasm with such unresponsive calmness. 
He kissed her, laughed a little, tried to 
pretend that he did not know. what she 


was talking about. Then he asked for 
Betty, asked how Alan’s cold was, said 
he’d tell her all about it after diriner. 


She had laughed at him teasingly; as 
if Alan’s sniffles and Betty’s rush down 
the stairs ‘into her father’s arms were 
more important than his being a great 
man! And he wanted his dinner, did he? 
All right, then, he should have it; but if 
She had known wouldn’t she just have 
made ita celebration? ; 


~ He had looked white at dinner, older 
than she had ever seen him look; but, of 
course, he was tired, after the excitement 
of the day—and no Wonder. To have been

Brothers! But she was gay enough; and 
afterward, when the children had been 
sent off to bed and John was in his usual 
deep chair near the lamp, she passed. be- 
hind him, kissed the top of his head where 
the hair was already growing thinner, then:

“Now, then!” she said. “I’ve waited 
just as long as I can! Tell me all about it.” 
- But he-~hesitated, not looking at her. 
Then he said, “How did you hear?” 

She told him, then added, with a lit- 


tle laugh of sheer happiness: “Don’t be 
stupid, John! Tell me!”. ‘ 


Again he seemed to hesitate; then he 


rose, went over to*his desk, and opened the

he stil kept that savings bank book in his 
own name, still retained every penny of 
the increase in salary, putting it by month 
after month—and for what? 

She could remember instance after in- 
stance, time after time, when her rebellion 
had made itself known in words—yet not 


mere rebellion had it ever been, but sense, — 


plain sehse and reasonableness. There 
was the ghastly time when Alan had ap- 
pendicitis—their first real JZright abcut 
either of the children. Dr. Mercer, John’s 
closest friend and their family physician, 
had said that he was almost sure there 
need be no operation, but- the sight of the 
boy's suffering drove her frantic; she de 
manded, yes, demanded, that another doc- 
tor be caMed in, that they operate at ance, 
that they have two nurses instearl of one, 
that they do everything, everything, to 
give her first born back to her arms. 

Bat John had listened to Frank Mercer, 
and Joann had dec:ced to wait. Of course, 
Alan got well, of course, the operation did 
not, after all, prove necessary; yet what 
she could never forget was the st::3d John 
had taken. There was no need, he had in- 
sisted, of letting their fears rush them inte 
wild extravagance, and the fact that the 
case had proven him right had never help- 
ed her to forget that be was willing to 
~@eny his boy anything, any least thing. in 
his hour of danger. Then,

She had.stared her amazement, but she 
had long since got beyond expressing her 
hurt and surprise at John’s secretiveness 
about business, and, .of course, she knew 
the sacredness of those bonds that could 
never be touched. 

“Well!” she permitted herself t6 ex- 
claim, in a tone that expressed much. 
Then, after a silence, she tried a way that 
her pride seldom permitted: “Then let us 
put it differently,” she said. “I want it. I 
want it very much. I have-emade up my

He looked up at her, and she saw. the

children’s sake, for her own sake, for.his. 

“Don’t you know, don’t you know, Hlea-

She had jumped up. “No! No! I don’t

She wanted to scream, to fight out 
against that sickening penuriousness—for 
what else was it?——that. incomprehensible 
determination of John’s to pile up dollar 
upon dollar, that was ageing him and de- 
them afl of what they” every

went to her boy and put her hands on his

strengthening her, “Alan, | wart you. not 


to speak of this again until I do. ‘But you °

She turned away, almost in shame, from 
the light in her boy's face. Yet she knew 
that now she had burned her bridges be- 
hind her; come what might, hereafter she 
would see that John gave her children and 
herself what they onght to have. And. it 
was with an outward. serenity, “whatever 
her inward trepidation might be, that she 
went down to await his coming. Because, 
in spite of it all, they had maintained the 
outward | of the love that still 
remained between them. That love—dim- 
med, yes; its quick response, its glorious 
sharing of life, its outspoken admiration 
and approval—those were gone; but there 
was still love.

Betty banged a thin imitation of a popu-

words in a voice already uncertain, she 
felt toward John something that had sel-

She was frightened. “Why, dear, what

anything gone wrong’? Don’t you feel well? .

He stood up, slowly, ke an old man, 
seemingly having to raise himself by the 
arms of his chair. Bat he laughed. 

‘That's what a rather long day does to 
aman, my dear! Not a thing’s wrong, ex- 
cept that I am a little tired, and I don't

“Then I don’t think you ought to!”

P- 


This is Karyl Norman, about as he looked 
when he met Ruth Budd at the masked ball 
in Melbourne. 


By Mary Rennels 


HE hailed from Cleveland, O., and 
he from Baltimore, Md.; yet they 
met in Melbourne, Australia! 

Now place any two young peo- 
ple thirteen thousand miles from 
home and let them meet in the 
seductive clime of Australia ’mid 
a lot of gayety and brilliant set- 

tings and ‘tis enough to put a quiver in 
Cupid’s bow. But in this case, even that 
was not enough. The fates were facetious, 
therefore they were generous. 

In Mélbourne it is a custom to hold a 
“community masked ball’ on Saturday 
night, to which is invited all of the city 
and any visitors and strangers within its 
walls. 

On this night that fate was engineer- 
ing, the ball was unustally brilliant. The 
revelers were dancing, laughing, jesting, 
when suddenly a lull fell on the merry- 
makers. 

They stepped aside, gazing with inter- 
est and curiosity on a latecomer. She 
was a little thing, stunningly petite, wear- 
ing a wicked gown of glittering black se- 
quins and jet. Her skirt was slashed to 
the knee and showed a flash of silken 
hosiery, encasing a shapely calif. The 
train of her gown swished around her 
feet. Her short, black, curly locks were 
bound back with a beautiful pearl head- 
band. Her arms and shoulders glistened 
white and bare under the glare of lights 


and her eyes flashed a radiant fird through 


a little black mask she wore. 


There were gasps of approval and a 
wave of comment as the young lady stroll- 
ed slowly through the hall, looking rigtit 
and left, apparently a bit bored and de- 
siring the company to dispel her loneli- 
ness. 

Suddenly a young chap detached him- 
self from the onlookers, came forward and 
bowed. He was medium in height, his 
hair was light and his scant costume of 
leopard skin gave full view to his muscu- 
lar arms and shoulders. 


The audience was extremely pleased_ 


with the pair. Romance hung heavy in 
the nieht air. “Twas a good match it 
seemed—so the onlookers turned to their 
affairg and let them dance, apparently 
greatly interested in one and,her and ob- 
vicasts quite satisfied with their meeting. 


HEN struck the hour of twelve! “Un- 


mask,” came the order. 


‘Mid cheers and shouts of recognition 
throughout the hall the pair had drawn 


away from the crowd. Slowly the young

‘Will She Grab His Fine

That's the Question Confronting a Clever Female [m- 
personator and a Dainty Girl Acrobat Who Met - 
in a Queer Way and Are About-to Marry. 


“and I’m Ruth Budd, playing on the 
same bill with you im an acrobatic rope 
feat.” 


So that was the romantic beginning, 


five years ago, of a love affair which has 
recently culminated in an engagement, 
with a marriage six months ahead. 

And the whole affair has given rise to 
much speculation. Many of those who 
have seen Karyl Norman as “The Creole 
Fashion Plate” at Keith’s theater have 
been greatly fooled. Several have not 
suspected him of being a man. . His high 
tenor voice is falsetto for stage purposes.

he is landing on the other fellow’s chin. 


girt raised her mask. Her almond-shaped, 
brown eyes snapped merrily and mis- 
chievously. She looked into the bewil- 
dered eyes of her escort and crudely said: 

“Tm glad that’s over. I need a shave 
and a cigarette!” 

There was a gasp, not a very manly 

one, from the light-haired Don Jan. 
“Oh-o-oh,” he niurmured effimately, “Who 
are you?” 
- “Oh, Pm the Creole fashion plate play- 
ing here in vaudeville next week. Just 
thought I'd see how I could get over off 
stage.” 

The young fellow was quiet for a mo- 
ment. Then slowly he raised his mask. 
Two blue eyes danced with glee, dimples 
found themselves in chin and cheek and 
a very feminine bit of humanity smiled 
and said: 


He wears ingenue clothes like a little 
flapper. He has adopted the mannerisms 
of a woman to an unbelievable degree. 


T IS difficult to think of him as the 
head of a household, the strong hafid 


. that rules the goings and comings of a 


devoted wife and writes the checks for 
butter and eggs. He seems too exquisite 
a bit of femininity to loll around the house 
in a bathrobe and slippers with an ugly 
pipe and the other paraphernalia of the 
married man. 


And the thought arises—will Mrs. Nor- 
man want to wear his clothes? Will the 
gorgeous creations of jet, sequins and 
lace. cause trouble in their household? 
Will she snatch his beautiful hats and 


wear them herself? Will he storm and 
fuss because he cannot find his silver 


Page Five 


slippers, and will his lovely Spanish shawl 


_ disappear mysteriously from the wardrobe 


in his dressing-room? 


Indeed much trouble can arise if he 
goes to the theater, washes the cigarette 
stains from his hands, whitens them with 
lignid powder, adjusts a black curly wig 
and then shouts for a dainty, fluffy bit of 
feminine apparel and finds it missing. 


But five years of courtship have dis- 
pelled any doubt in their minds as to the 
success of their marriage and they. have 
become immune to the humorous specula- 
tions of their friends. Those on the in- 


Pre is Ruth Budd as she is off the stage

side know that the romance is quite like 
no other. These two are not stage folk 
away from the footlights, Karyl is a mus- 
cular, aggressive young fellow and Ruth 
is a dainty, ladylike bit of a thing. 


It was mother who made them wait 
until now before marrying and daughter 
Ruth tells why. 


They have both worked hard, each 


year getting a spot higher on the bill 
until today they are headliners. Ruth 
Budd is recognized as an artist in her line 
and Karyl Norman is one of the best fe- 
male impersonators on the stage. 


And as the story books go, they are 


to be married June 13, and sail to Europe 
on a honeymoon, where they will fill a 
few engagements and return to tour the 
states. Mr. E. F. Albee, head of the Keith 
circuit, has granted them a special dis- 
pensation—they are to be booked on the 
same bills and thus travel together. Even 
industry bows before romance. 


When Miss Budd was at Keith’s not 


long ago it was suggestéd to her that her 
engagement proved the theory that oppo- 
sites attract. She is muscular, aggressive 
and forceful, physically and personally. 
Karyl Norman, when impersonating the 
weaker sex, is naturally timid, dainty and 
effeminate. 


But Miss Budd claims that is not the 
case. She says that these dispositions are 
reversed off stage. -Karyl is manly both 
in appearance and manner. He goes is 
for all sorts of athletics and there is 
no trace of the femininity he portrays so 
successfully. 

Nevertheless, the marriage offers a 
new angle to the eternal wrangle about 
clothes that generally prevails in the do- 
mestic circle. In this case, after the wife 
has taken what siie wants, not out of his 
pockets, but out of his wardrobe, it will 
be the man who will sigh: 


“Coufound it, I have nothing to wear!’

street near the Grand Central station— 
that huge gateway to New York through 
which stream each year. so many thou- 
sands of girls who are rated as “missing” 
on the police registers of other American 
towns. It was after 11 o’clock ana the 
crowds were thinning out. 


Suddenly I.saw a yeung girl with a 
suit case wandering aimlessly along to- 
ward us. It. was easy to see that the city 
was new’to her. I thought I saw a chance 
to demonstrate to my.friend, so I went up 
to the gir) and smiled in a 
cordial way. 

“Do you want to have 
some fun?” I asked. “What 
do “you say to . taking an 
auto ride with my friend and: 
me and seeing something otf 
the city? -Here, taxi!” . .- 

The girl © seemed - over- 

- whélmed with joy to. think 
of such an-honor being thrust. © f-}:! 
‘upon’ her and. she. stepped 
into the cab I- had: hailed,.. J: 
friendly and trustful: .We. 
drove on about the city and 
before five minutes had pass- 
ed we had her whole story 
from her eager lips. : 

She had just come .:;. 
from upstate. New York 
nearly starved. for. some oac 
to talk to when we happen:¢ 
along. Father too strict, moth-°’ 
er dead—it was the same old 
story I had heard hundreds 
of times. I sent her to my 
girls’ club for the — night, 
after warning her not to. 
take taxi drives with stran- 
gers, and later found her a 
job. 

Today she is a successful business gir 
in New York, but except. for the accident 
of meeting us she might have joined -that 
great army of missing girls who go down 
to their ruin in American.towns and cities 
by the tens of thousands every year. 

The average American won’t believe 
that such a condition exists in this. coun- 
try of his, which he claims is the most 
civilized place on earth. I have had 
mothers by the score smile when I spoke 
of girls by-the tens of thousands being 


éngnared; they thought it was exaggera- 


tion. 


0 they realize the number of missing 
girls in the United States each year 
—over 106,000? ; 


Not long age I went through the files 
of letters I had received from runaway 
girls in the last four years. There were 
over two thousand, and while each was 


an individual story with its own peculiar 
circumstances, there -was nevertheless an 
astonishing sameness in them all. They 
were nearly ali the stories of broken lives 
—broken by some one person whom they 
had trusted. The missing girl comes to 
grief not through her own wickedness, 
for she isn’t wicked. She is innocent and 
stumbles into pitfalls devised by cleverer 
heads than hers. ~~ | 
Of all the traps which swallowed up 
young American girls there is probably 
none more attractive-and insidious than 
the fake school which represents to the 
girl that by taking private lessons in

HE vaudevillian stands before the 
drop curtain that separates him 
from the full stage-where the 


i next act is being set. as he en- | 


tertains the audience. Techni- 
cally he is “working* in one,” 
which in reality means that he 
is working to keep the crowd 
“from yawning until real and actual enter- 
tainment can be provided. 

He gazes on the drop curtain, which 
depicts a street flanked by stores of va- 
rious denominations. The scene shows no 
persons passing into the stores, nor does 
it disclose persons passing out of these 
painted marts of trade. 

Whereupon, the vaudevillian, being a 
vaudevillian and encumbered by tradition, 
remarks as has every vaudevillian under 
similar circumstances since vaudeville was 
called “variety,”. “A-ha! A busy. day in —” 
‘The name represented by the blank being 
the name of the nearest country town to 
the city in which the vaudevillian is ap- 
pearing. 

The vaudeville audience evinces great 
satisfaction, for vaudeville audiences are 
like vaudevillians—they are ruled by tradi- 
tion. They have been taught to laugh at 
this jest from the time they were cradled 
in vaudeville. 


HEY do not pause to reflect and get 
the really keen humor of the vaudevil- 
lian’s remark. They do not know that he 


is indulging in the finest sort of satire at. 


the expense of the city. They do not know

that while thousanus and thousands of 
persons have seen thousands and thou- 
sands of city stores as idle as a stamp 
clerk the day after Christmas, there is no 
one who has ever beheld a country store 
that wasn’t doing business from the mo- 
ment its doors were opened until the very 
moment that the doors were being closed, 


-while the last customer cut himself a plug 
of eating tobacco and paid therefor after 


he and the proprietor had jointly emerged 
into the stilly night outside. 


Now this isn’t a dissertation on vaude- 
villians. If it wére the pages would be 
filled with dashes and stars and other in- 
signia of strong and unprintable language. 
The thought that I am trying to bring 
home is that we are a conglomerate mass 
of egotistical chuckle heads when we in- 
dulge in our favorite theme of discussing 
our frenzied city life and laugh at the 
inactivity of life where the tall grass 
grows. : ,

deep, abysmal and enduring ignorance of 
what bustle, energy, and achievement 


really.mean until he has spent at least one — 


Saturday in the. dull. inertia. of.a country 
town. 


Some weeks ago, I had the pleasure of 
banging away at some birds down in south 
Georgia...The birds did not suffer tremen- 
dously, and I enjoyed myself hugely. How- 
ever, as the week -drew to its: close, I 
wasn’t a bit disheartened when my host

suggested that “‘we run into town tomor- 
row.” ‘ 


I had no question in my mind but that - 


the run into town meant a run into At- 
lanta, but Atlanta has ¢@ifferent nomen- 
clature in the country. There it’s the city. 
The. term, town, is applied to that center 
of civilization where weekly trade in farm 


products, political gossip, gossip that isn’t. 


political, and everything in a business ‘line 
not done by mail order catalog, is trans- 
acted every week-end. 


E MADE an early start. The flivver’s. 


lights were casting an eerie giow. on 
a stretch of road that s00kea preturnat- 
urally white as we rattled away toward 
the center of civilization. 

“He must have a lot of business to 
transact, starting this early,” 1 remarked 
to myself, and then as I must have my 
jest though it be an ancient one I said 
to myself “or must Want to get back early 
to keep from missing his weekly bath.” 

But if he had a lot of business or was 
anxious to preclude the necessity. of be- 
longing to the great.unwashed for another 
week, there were plenty of people who 
likewise had a plethora of affairs or ainx- 
iety for ablutions. 

That white road wasn’t crowded in the 
sense that a city street is crowded during 
a traffic jam, but it wasn*t lonesome, par- 


ticularly after the ‘sun at last peeped over 


the shadowy pines on the hill range to the 
east. 

Lumbering ahead, we saw and soon 
passed a cotton wagon.of the old-school 
with three bales piled behind a pair of 


mules with harness in a great state of ais- 


repute. The necro driver was wide awake 
and conversational, particularly to the 
mules, while wife and. progeny, scattered 
all over the eotton, seemed to be in a fair

ing head humbly draws the farmer and his 
wife with the market baskets full of eggs 
in the back of the buggy and a can of 
milk back there, too, and he mourns the. 
fact that the farmer has forgotten the 
smart turnout with which he won his bride 
and the farmer’s wife has forgotten the 


noble animal her swain was handling when _, 


her. heart first fluttered. . | 

We reach the straggling outskirts of 
the town. The sun is just beginning to 
Shine in a whole-hearted sort of a way, 
but already we can see signs of activities. 
Breakfast has long since been disposed 
of and housewives are sweeping front 
porches and there is a cackling of poultry, 
doomed to grace Sunday dinner tables in 
back yards. 


N.THE town, we pull up. at the hitch 

rack, for though the rack has become 
obsolete, tradition has fixed the habir of 
farmer folk halting beside it.. The rack 
looks badly in need of actual patronage. 
It has tthe pale appearance of desertion. 
Diguse has made it food for worms just 
like brave Percy. My companion has busi- 
ness in the courthouse, some such matter 
as the looking up of title to land that is 
to be purchased or sold and I am permit- 
ted to loaf-and observe. 

There are a round dozen stores about 
the square, three or four of them dealing 
in -general 
farming : implements. ~There is a. drug 
store and a barber shop and a run down 
at the heel establishment that seems to 
specialize in antiquated. peanuts, for the 
peanut roaster is in evidence on a pretty 
barren floor and the roaster does not seem 
to have seen usage these ten years. A 
dilapidated bunch of wilting bananas hangs 
on the outside and there is a sign that 
“superior wieners’”’ are to be had at 5 cents

number of antiquated shawls, coats, cloaks,

. @d: against the cold, for the mornmg was 


still’‘snippish and the negro has never be- 
come acclimated even to the balmly win- 
ters of Georgia. \ 


There had been a.flurry in the New 
York cotton market ard that flurry was 
reflected way down on this south Georgia 
road, for we passed not a few cotton wag- 
ons and in all of them the farmer folks 
were driving briskly to sell and realize. 


HE very air was brisk and business- 

like as we rattled along the road. The 
horse and mule had pretty largely disap- 
peared, but cars were visible every half 
mile or so. A rakish looking one that had 
seen heavy and reckless wear was. laid up 
undergoing some sort of minor automobile 
surgery on the side of the road. The cur- 
tains were up and the surgeons gave but 
scanty acknowledgement of the invariable 
morning greeting. 

They were the representatives of the 
new business, the great manufacturing in- 
terest that has been transferred from the 
heart of industrial districts to the isolated 
places of the hilis. ‘Right at that point it 
was likely that later in the day some im- 


portant business would be transacted that 


would be concluded, perhaps, in the courts 
or the jail houses the following week. 

And now we get a touch of old times. 
There’s a regular buggy actually being 
drawn by a regular horse, a horse that 
shows signs of a day when it could hold 
its head proudly and step a mile with the 
best of them along the road. But gone is 
that day, and the good animaj with hang-

look cold and disconsolate. | 


A few despairing looking tillers of the 
soil in patched overcoats that had obvious- 
ly been government property during the 


late unpleasantness, and who run largely 
to sparse whiskers and plentiful chewing 
tobacco stains on their habiliments are 
there, They are all indulging in conversa- 
tion, soda crackers and cove oysters, to 
which latter article of diet they seem 
peculiarly addicted. I have never discov- 
ered the reason, but it is an unfailing 
truth that no matter how prosperous and 
progressive a country town may be, there 
is always the dejected store that is being 
patronized by dejected patrons Who eat 
cove oysters with an avidity that must 
bring joy to the jolly oysterman’s heart. 


UT there is no dejection in the other 

marts of trade. In front of one store 
there is the liveliest sort of traffic going 
on in questionable looking bulk meat to 
which the calored patronage is being 
drawn by a terrific whanging on an iron 
triangle. The sale of this meat is being 
diversified by equally brisk traffic in a 
particularly virulent looking candy that 
the negroes seem to be buying with a 
reckless abandon.

Leon Bourgeois, leading 
. French apostle of the league 
of nations. Right: Penciled 
memo to Mr. Wilson from 
Colonel E. M: House. 


By Raymond Stannard Bake, 


Designated for This Work by the Former 
President. 


CHAPTER III. 
HERE is a kind of mysterious 
potency, a symbolism of action 
and power, in a great document, 
Here are the words set down; 
here the point outlined! 

Such a great document was 
the president's original draft of 

the covenant of the league of nations. 

I remembe. the surcharged atmos- 
phere of the Crillon hotel when the word 
went round that this document had been 
at length distributed. Who had it? What 
was in it? It had been secretly printed, 
with the single word “covenant’”—a word 
the president liked—upon the cover. In 
it was set forth, concretely for the first 
time, what the president meant by the 
proposed league of nations, and in cer- 
tain mysterious “supplementary articles” 
he also developed his ideas regarding 
some of the specific settlements. He had 
sent this document to various of the lead- 
ers in order to get their reactions. 

It is easy enough to accept general 
principles—all the world pays pious hom- 
age to the phrase “disarmament” or “lim- 
itation of armament’—but the real fight 
begins with the concrete applicetion of 
thosg principles. Thus it went instantly 
around Paris—by a kind of wireless tele- 
graphy not known to Marconi—what the 
Americans really meant by the reduction 
of armaments as nase cemges in the fourth 
of the fourteen points, “to the lowest point 
consistent with domestic safety.” 

Article IV of the president’s myste- 
rious new covenant contained the terms 
of a program that cut at the very root of 
continental power and safety. Among 
other things, compulsory military service 
was to be abolished, not only in Germany, 
but everywhere—‘“all the powers sub- 
scribing to the treaty of peace.” The 
manufacture of “munitions and imple- 
ments of war by private enterprise or for 
private profit” was to be forbidden. “Fall 
and frank publicity as to all national 
armaments” was to disturb the corner- 
stone of secrecy upon. which, under the 
old system, military preparation had al- 
ways rested. And, above all, there was 
a new standard of armament proposed; 
that of “domestic safety.” It was as 
though Samson had given a first shake to 
the pillars of the Temple! 

The storm broke at once; private con- 
ferences were held by the president, 
notably one with the alarmed premier of 
italy, Orlando; another in which the whzle 
subject of the covenant was discussed 
with Lord Robert. Ceci} and General 
Smuts. end the discussion opened up 
soon afterward both in the council of ten 
and in tle important league of natio 
commission. For article IV of the cove- 
nant based upon point 4 laid bare what 
. was undoubtedly the fundamental prob- 
lem of the peace conference; the prob-

HER OWN CASE. 5 


T eyery turn, also, the concrete evi- 
France 


_ @dences of what war meant to 


were ready at hand; the visual‘demonstra- 


tion of their reasons for being afraid: 
M. CLEMENCEAU: . » But the 
fact must be faced that.during four 
years of war the countryside of 
France had been devastated and sub- 
jected to the worst kind of savag- 
ery. . . . He wished to repeat what 
he had already said, namely, that the 
fortune of war had been such that 
neither American nor British terri- 
tories had suffered, while the terri- 
tory of France had been so ravaged 


lem of the safety of nations and by what 
means it was to be made secure. 


THE FEARS 
OF THE NATIONS. 
$ nv great war had shaken the old 
world into ruin; old habits and rela- 
tionships had broken down; and each 
nation, feeling its very existence in dan- 
ger, flew to arms to protect itself A 
great fear prevailed. Each nation had re- 
verted to a primitive reliance upon its 
own sword. The sword of France was 
its army, and he army rested upon the 
institution of compulsory service. The 
sword of Britain was her navy and her 
power upon the seas. 

Therefore, the proposal to limit arma- 
ments struck at the very roots of European 
safety. When it touched land armament 
it set France and Italy a-shiver; when it 
touched naval armament, the British Em- 
pire shook, and every small nation in 


‘Burepe, fearful of its neighbors, was in 


deadly fear lest, if it be not permitted 
to keep up a large army, its very exist- 
ence be endangered. 

It would have been the wildest folly, 
as the president clearly saw, to propose 
any rea] disarmament without setting up 
some new guarantee of safety in place of 
it, which would relieve the fears of 
Europe, restore confidence. He proposed 
only what many thoughtful men had pro- 
posed before him, and what the American 
colonies had achieved, a guarantee of 
safety based upon common agreement, 
backed by force if necessary, in which the 
nations could trust‘ in short, a strong 
co-operative league of nations. 

But the president, like most Americans 
—for America had never been thoroughly 
frightened—did not fully realize until he 
arrived in Europe how enormously ex2g- 
gerated were the fears and how precarious 
the safety of Europe; how every discus- 
sion, for example, where France was con- 
cerned, got back to a question of French 
security. 

It was borne In upon him at every con- 
ference, the press was fulj of it, the very 
atmosphere reeked with it. As M. Clem- 
enceau expressed it in the council of ten 
(secret minutes Jan. 30): 

M. CLEMENCEAU said that the 
French were the nearest neighbors of 
Germany, and could be at all times, 
as they had been in the past, sud- 
denly attacked . . . France realized 
that Great Britain had responsibili- 
ties in all parts of the world, and 
could not keep the whole of her 
strength concentrated at one point. 
America was far away and could not 
come at once to the assistance of 
France. If the league of nations and 
the peace of the world were to be

that it would seem as though recov- 
ery would be impossible. ... The 
industries of France had been scien- 
tifically destroyed . . . France had 
lost 3,000,000 men, either killed or 
mutilated. 

The president clearly revealed in his 
speeches at that time that he realized 
increasingly the gravity of the prob'em. 
. | remember well the powerful impres- 
sion made by the president’s address up- 
on a crowded audience in the French 
chamber of ,deputies delivered February 
3, soon after he had visited the ruins at 
Rheims, (“I saw, the noble city of Rheims 
in ruins, and I could not help saying té 
myself: “Here is where the blow fell, 
because ths rulers of the world did not 
sooner see how to prevent it.’”) He 
said of France in this address: 

“Hers was the immediate peril. Hers 
was the constant dread. . - I do not 
need to point out to you that east of you 
in Europe the future is full of question. 
Beyond the Rhine, across Germany, across 
Poland. across Russia, across Asia, there 
are questions unanswered. .. . Fran 


ce 
stands in the presence of these threaten- 


~ —100@ per cent 


ing and unanswered questions—threaten- 
ing because unanswered—stands waiting 


for the solution of matters which touch 
her directly, intimately and constantly, 
and if she must.stand alone, what must 
she do?” | 

Here the president was putting the 
problem of the French as eloquently as 
they themselves put it; but his proposal 
for meeting it was wholly different from 
that of the French. When reduced to its 
last analysis the French saw safety only 
in military armament, an armed nation 
or an armed alliance; while the president 
saw safety only in a co-operation of na- 
tions, “which will make it necessary, in 
the future, to maintain those erushing 
armaments which make the peoples suf- 
fer almost as much in peace as they suf- 
fered in war.” 

Tike French position at Paris was set 
forth and defended with matchless in- 
genvu@y and obstinacy. No matter what 
nr ‘+ “= belonged to, or whether 
he Was a statesman, a soldier, a diplomat 
or a financier, he was first of all French 
French!—and movcd 
straight ahead securing French safety. 
Foch had a military plan of safety, Bour- 
geois a’ diplomatic plan, Loucheur and 
Klotz an economic plan (but the co-ordi- 
r > ootween them was perfect), and 
Clemenceau was the supreme strategist 
of the entire campaign. If the French 
did not achieve all they sought at Paris, 
it was not for lack of sheer intelligence! 


The French had their entire program 
worked out before the peace conference 
met. They were the first to place their 
memoranda in the president’s hands. No’ 
other nation approached them—unless it 
was the Japanese!—in diplomatic pre- 
paredness or singleness of purpose. The 
British seemed not prepared at all; al- 
ways appeared to live from hand to 
mouth, diplomatically speaking, and yet 
never lost a trick, while the Halians were 
so divided in their inner councils as never 
to strike any clear note. 


MARSHAL FOCH’S 
MEMORANDA. 


MONG the president’s papers is Mar- 


shal Foch’s detailed memoranda on 
the military aspects of French safety, 
dated January 10 (two days before the first 
session of the peace conference) and 
signed with his curious; sprawling “F. 
Foch;” so also is the Bourgeois plan for 
a league of nations, and certain early 
memoranda, concerning the economic as- 
pects of French safety. 

Marshal Foch wishes to hold the Rhine 
as the “common barrier of security neces- 
sary to the league of democratic nations,” 
and in order to do this he demands that 
“the powers of the entente . . be or- 
ganized henceforth on a military-basis to 


render possible the timely intervention 


of the other states which are the defend- 
ers of civilization.” His league would, in

its emphasis was on fixing minimum’ . 


rather than meximem limits sperm arme- 
ments. 

On February 7 the French economists 
set up the third leg of the tripod upen 
which Prenech sectirity was to rest. This 
was im a report of the disarmament vf 
Germany by a committee of the supreme 
war council, headed by M. Loucheur, M. 


Loucheur was ene of the able financial . 


leaders ef France and was serving im 
Clemenceau’s cabinet as minister of re- 
construction. This report proceeded upon 
the assumption that modern war rests 
upon an economic basis. In oder, there- 
fore, to be absolutely safe, the allies 
must not only impose military disarma- 
nent.upow Germiamy with the control of 
‘the Rhine frontier, backed by an armed 
league of nations, but Germaay must also 
be disarmed or crippled economically. 
For here the Fromeh clearly recognized 
their inferiority. ‘The BLeucheur report 
called for supplementing military disarm- 
ament by a control of the arms and muni- 
tions factories of Germany te prevent 
rearming. Allied officers were thus to su- 
pervise German industry to see that mili- 
tary supplies were not ced. As 2 
secondary proposal the Lesacheur report 
called tor the “absolute control by mili- 
tary occupation of . .-+. Bssen and the 


principal Krupp establishments, the great- . 


er part of the Mhenish-Westphalian coal 
‘ielan and the metatiic industries which 


depended on these.” 


WILSON’S REJECTION 
OF THE PROGRAM.

xpression regarding the findings 
~of is Lineinoen, which General Bliss had 
also opposed when they were advanced 
earlier in the supreme war council. He 
even wekt so far as to call it a “panic 
program.” Here is his exact comment: 
(Secret minutes, February 7): 
President Wilson considered the 
recommen@stions contained in the 
Loucheur report to be a panic pro- 
gram. The report not only called for 
the surrender of big guns, which in his 
opinion should be given up, but it also 
went into details ef aircraft and fac- 
tory production . . . he thought that 
if officers were seut there they would 
get into trouble an@ would have-to be 
supported by military . forces.

not accept, for it meant an “indefinite

Germany. HK also meant constant inter-

to ‘war. He said, March 17 (Secret

reduced to a strength of 100,000 men, it 
was ridiculous to maintain an army of 
eceupation of 200,000 men on the Rhine 
: . It would cost 100,000,000 (sterling) 
a year if the burden were placed on the 

exchequer and the result of this 
would be that there woald be nothing 
left for com _ 

Indeed, the cost of this army of occu- 
pation since the armisties has been stu- 
pendous. Up to April, 1921, according to 
figures officially issued by the reparations 
commizsion, the totals are as follows in

Great Britain .........s..-.- 991,016,859

Yet the French consistently preferred 
these enormous expenditures for safety 
rather than for reconstruction. Of course, 
there is another aspect of this policy; for, 
by this methed, bitterly and somewhat 
exaggeratedly described by Lioyd George 
in the argument of June 2, already refer- 
red to, “of quartering the French army 
on and making Germany pay 
the cost of it,” France gets back part of 
the cost. In passing it may be noted that 
Germauy is now being taxed to support 
the militarism in France from which she 
has herself been absolved, though by no 
desire of her own. R 
Thus did the insatiable demand for 
safety operate in the economic field: and 
thus did the economists work together 
with the soldiers and the diplomats for 
the French conception of safety—although 
at the same time pursuing the irrecon- 


‘Cilable aim of reparation.

~ | LOOM, that has settled over the . 
‘i theatrical world since tne defi- 
“mite collapse of the present sea- 
sia in New York as well as on 
the road, is reviving movements - 
looking toward the organization 
of stock. companies throughout 
the country. 
The idea has caught hold even in New 
York where the Theater Guild is planning 


to open a repertory theater where a suit- 


able stock company will be provided fora “ 


succession of stars such as Arthur Hop- 
kins, Richard Bennett, Margaret Angling, 
Arnold Daly, Joseph Schildkraut and: Les- 
ter Lonergan. 


A theater has already been. ‘amie in 


Detroit for the same purpose, with the © 


promoters out that the idea has 


been successful everywhere in Europe and » 


could be successful in America. 
As a matter of fact it was successful in 


America for many, many years. Before 
the war between. the’ states there was 
hardly a town of any ‘pretentions that 
didn’t have its own stock company to 
form the background for visiting stars, 
who would stop off for varying engage- 
ments, lasting from one week to several 
months. 
The people who have the best interests 
of the theater at heart have-long ago 


recognized that something: revolut 
must be done for the provinces. 


point to the fact that the oe gr sal- 


aries of actors, brought abeut by. the 
equity, the tremendous outlay of money 
that managers must make for —

surely woh awa) «. the legitimate 
drama. . 
I don’t know that, Atian“§ is ready for 
repertory. When. the fact is considered 
that Walter Hampden played here to less 
than a guard, at the same time 
furnishing the dramatic treat of the sea- 
son, and was followed by the “Greenwich 
Village Follies,” who did business despite 
the fact that it was one of the most atro- 
cious things éver palmed off by a press 
agent, the conclusion is natural that At- 
Janta is pretty well siatisfied with con- 


ditions, particularily as we have had a 
good percentage of excellent attractions. 


. oad teers plan devised to stimulate 

interest is, the soviet company. One 
of this type was formed by Wilton Lack- 
aye. The actors were all stockholders. 
They worked for just exaetly what they 
co’'' draw into the house and were ac- 
cordingly willing to eut prices. Speaking 
of this venture, Mr. said:. 

“There are two comtitbvating factors. In 
the first place thereds a scarcity of money. 
People who are #till employed are not 
earning the large salaries of last year and 
therefore cannot afford amiusement at 
high prices. The other cause my col-

“We believe we have Sivea- the prob-' 


lem for the playgoer. To begin with, we 


have made an unprecedented reduction in 
seat prices. On eve- 
nings and Wednesday a the best 
seats in this theater are available for $1.50 
and there are hundreds of others to be 
sold for from 50 cents to $1. And for the

~Mary Garden, After Eleven Years, to Reappear i in Title Role of Salome. 


Bx. Louise Dooly 


HE mid-winter panorama of mw 
sic all over.the country is hav- 
wean) ing its dramatic features, Just as 
any properly conducted panorama 
ought to have. 
Chief of these is the reappear- 
ance after eleven years, of “Sa- 
lome,” the Richard Strauss opera, with 
Mary Garden im the title role. The 
suppression of this opera at the Metro- 
politan, on its first production in the coun- 
try, will be remembered by & great many 
people who have forgot other Mm 


at {he Metropolitan, which were.ii é 


important from thé standpoint: ot snsiiiond 
influence. The Viewpoint of peopte has 
changed considerably | in those eleven years. 
Whether for better or worse depends on 
individual opinion;.« But it is rather re- 
markable that when “Salome”: was again 
presented after eleven years, this time in 


. Chicago, the police did not forbid further 


performance, but public taste -.will ap- 
parently accomplish before long, in less 


dramatic style, what the law took into its. 


hands on the former occasion.:' 

A typical comment is that of the critic 
of The Daily Tribune, who said: “After 
witnessing ‘Salome’ again, | am divided in 
my mind whether to be more enraptured 
over the gorgeousness of Richard Strauss’ 
score or appalled over the frightful insan- 
ity of Oscar Wilde’s play.” After confess- 
ing to “having felt a bit squirmy after the 


’ curtain went down,” the critic goes on to 


report that “just as logical as was the 
progress of the drama was the presesta- 
tion of ‘Salome’ by Migs Garden. It was 
relentless and ghastly. There are no words 
tg tell of her savagery, her beauty, the ter- 
rifying fascination she throws over her 
victims and her audience as well. The or- 
chestra down below wreaking wonders un- 
der the baton of : Polacco, . Miss 
Garden picturing . hic’ nightmares 
up above—every eise in the operatic 
scheme must seem flat, stale and un-

OHN ALDEN CARPENTER, . one of 

America’s most serious composers, has 
given the musical world somewhat of a. 
jolt, in his ballet. pantomine, “Krazy Kat,” 
which was recently given its first perform- 
ance by the Chicago Symphony orches- 
tra. Critical comment admits that it was. 
was good jazz, although, naturally, it 
pokes fun at Mr. Carpenter, that he should 


give his valuable time to music which is 
a standard so-much lower than Mr. Car- 


penter has for many years set’ for himself. 


LBERT COATES, the English conauec- 
tor, is back in this country for some 
guest performances, brought about by the 


excellent impression he made ona similar 
visit last year. The New York Sympheny 
orchestra was his instrument in his first 
performance this season, 


HE number and excellence, by the way, 
of the symphony orchestras, which 
the United States is now supporting, is one 
of the most significant and nearten ng 
things about the future of music in Amer- 


ica. No less constructive a condition is 
the increasing effort, in many cities, where 
theré is an orchestra, to show the children 
the pleasure and profit such music has in 
store for them. : 
VELAND, O. AO, took a unique step, 
which has worked out successfully, to 


make its orchestral concerts popular. The 


directors of the orchestra association wrote 


what they call “Low-brow” notes, to a num- 


ber of Cleveland people, who were not sub- - 


scribers to the concerts, and who had 
shown no interest. These letters.. accord- 
ing to the manager, were expressed m.a 
popular vernacular, in- order to give the 
perfectly good minds of these people some- 


thing familiar to which to pin their atcen- © 
tion, and to take away the fear of the un- .. 


known. One of these “Low-brow” notes 
was introduced this way:

‘*‘Male, temaie, and perfume,’’ this is titled. Which 
preves that all people of colorful characters and many-angled 
minds are partial to perfume. At least that appears to be 
what the artist is intimating. 


AS Germany gone raving mad? We are constrained 
to ask, after having looked over the strange ‘‘new 
art’? advertisements now appearing in German 
magazines, some of which are reproduced here. 

Can you guess what they mean? Neither can 
our feeble mind. But we are informed on good 
authority that these pictures are ads for every- 
thing from afternoon gowns and perfume te 

spiritualism and printing. | 

You just look at the picture and ‘‘feel’’ what it means. 
It’s ‘*expression.’’ Unless you are ‘‘kultured’ it isn 
for you. 

Any American business man who wants some of the 
‘‘feeling’’ new German art inhis advertisements can order 
some’ from an artist by the name of Walter Kampmann, 
Berlin, 8. W. 47, Wartenburgstrasse 24. | 

Walter committed -all these, he did. They just bubbled 
up from the bottom of his esthetic soul. Right from the 
deeps. And he gave ’em to the world for keeps. 

Danke schon, Walter. pes |

nations (Pranmée perticulariy), owimg to 
their geographical position, were more 
exposed to attack than others and that, 
therefore, they should be permitted a larg- 
ér armamegt than others, or be protected 


by special guarantees. HK was the logic™ 


of this “special risk” that, later in the 
conferenee, led te the agreement, upon 2a 
specia] Anglo-American treaty to come te 
the defense of France im ease of a 
by Germany. In the gresident’s view this 
was a better methed of temporarily calm- 
ing French fears than the adoption of 
any of the various military guarantees ob- 
stinately demanded, by. the French. At 
least it was a method -@£ pesee and co- 
operation. Ae ies 

President Wilson,. strongly supported 
by Lord Robert Cecil, oppesed the French 
idea of international armament. He saw 
in it, as he said, a method of “substituting 
international militarism for national mili- 
tarism,” and the whole idea of control was 


repugnant to him. 
WOODROW WILSON’S 


' CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM. 


1 O nation,” he said, “will consent to 
N control. As for us Americans, we 
cannot eonsent te contrel because of our 
constitution. We must do everything that 


“suffered and F know that she wishes 


obtain the best guarantees possible - 
fore she enters the league, and everything 
that we can do ifn this direction we shall 
do, but we cannot accept proposals which 


are in direct contradiction to our, consti- 


tution. . . . The only method by which 
we can achieve this end lies in our having 
confidence in the good faith of the ma- 
tions who belong to the leagus. There 
must be between them a cordial agreement 


and good will.” 

But the formidable Bourgeois, though 
voted down in the commission, never sur- 
rendered in, bis main contention and kept 
bringing up his proposal for a meagre hs 
league in various forms, directly an 
indirectly; and when he failed to nig 
his point, fmal French acceptance of t : 
American-British form of the er 
was. in part, conditioned upon. the wor’) 
guarantee by America and Great ng 
in order to quiet French fears, until “t © 
league itself affords sufficient protection, 
to come to the support of France in case 
ef attack by Germany. ‘ 

But if the allies nen pees to gun tage

program, yet when thé problem of dis- 


i ied both 

ming Germany arose, they appl . 
the coiveisle and the program almost vo 
erally—for it seemed, in that — cll 
fectiy reasonable. On February 12, 
ident Wilson thus stated the program as 
pertaining to German disarmament: 

Disarmament eontained two ele- 
ments—43) the maintenance of an ade- 
quate force for internal police; —(2) 
the national contribution to the gen- 
eral force of the future league of na- 
tions. . . . Al we need contemplatc 
was the amount of armed force re- 
quired by Germany to maintain in- 
ternal erder and to keep down bol- 
shevism. . . Im general he felt 
that until we knew what the German 
government was going to be and how 
the German people were going to be- 
have, the world had a moral right 
to disarm Germany, and to subject 
her to a generation of thoughtful- 

oS. 

"80 it was that the ideal standard was 
applied te the enemy, compulsory service 
abolished, the army reduced to a’ police 
force of 100,000 men, and the navy .toe’a 
mere basis of defence. Moreover, as a 
coneession to the French demand for in- 
ternational control- which had failed -of 
acceptamee as a genera] proposition, Ger- 
many’s afmaments are subject to investi- 
gation at any time by majority vote of

miscion.

But the abolition of compujsory serv-

know exactly what Ortande teld the presi- 
dent, for we have it in his own words, used 
later, in the council of four- (May 15): 

As I then explained te President 
Wilson, Italy would net be able to 
raise am army by volrntary service. 
Such a system would be tee difficult 
im its application, since the whele tra- 
dition of the country is against it. 
Consequently, the Italian army would 
have to be organized on a basis af 

service.

this covenant”—-which - might be along 


way off—yet the Italians and French were 
fearful even of discussing the principle as 
concerning themselves; - though they later 
agreed, with reluctance, to the application 
of it to Germany and Austria. 

These considerations were brought up 
in the more formal conference with Lord 
Robert Cecil and General Smuts. Both 
of these men shared the strong aversion 
of English-speaking races to the idea of 
compulsory service, but both also recog- 
nized the practical difficulty of securing 
the support of France and Italy to a fu- 
ture co-operation of the nations with so 
strong a provision regarding compulsory 
service. In the revised draft of the cove- 
nant, therefore, the provision regarding 
compulsory service became Article 8, and 
was thus whittled down: 

It (the executive council) shall also 
inquire into the feasibility of abolish- 
ing compulsory military service, and 
the substitution therefore of forces 
enrolled upon a voluntary basis, and 
into the military and naval equipment 
which it is reasonable to maintain: 

But even this device of mere inquiry 
was too strong for the French, and when 
the article came up for the first time in 


the league of nations commission (Feb-. 


ruary 6), which met in the «vening in Colo- 
nel House’s large office in the Crillon 
hotel, we find M. Bourgeois rising quickly 
to object. He did not wish even the pos- 
sibility of-abolishing compulsory service 
to be discussed. 

This position was further developed by 


Signor Orlando, of Italy, and M..Larnaude, . 


the other French delegate, and, finally, in 
order to meet this determined opposition 
even to the mention ef compulsory mili- 
tary service and yet keep a door open for 
future action by the league of nations the 
president proposed the following substi- 
tute: 

The executive council -shall also 
determine for the consideration and 
action of the several governments 
what* military equipment and arma- 
ment is fair and reasonable in propor- 
tion to the scale of forces laid down 
in the program of disarmament, and 
these Itmits, when adopted, shall not 
be exceeded without the permission 
of the body of delegates. 

In short, the president here throws the 
whole power of initiating action in the 
matter of limitation of armament into the 
hands of the Tuture league of nations. 
While this proposal was adopted at the 
moment, it did not, by ‘any means, close 
the discussion, and the final wording of 
the proposal was reached only after much 
controversy and the introduction of the 
idea of “special risk” so vigorously de- 


of the program. “There shall be full and 
frank publicity as to all national arma- 
ments and mifitary and naval progfams.” 
“Here again French fears presented an ob- 
stacie.. M. Bourgeois argued that so iong 


as certain powers (he meant Germany) 


remained outside the league, it would be 
folty-to let them know the military secrets 
of those inside; and even when they came 
in, one must not trust them too far. What 
he wanted was publicity « regarding the 


, German armament, but not the armament 


of the allied nations. Finally, “full and 
frank. publicity” became “Interchange of 
infermation” among themselves—a more 


_ limited proposal, but an advance over any- 


thing in the past. The final clanse of the 
covenant upon this subject reads as fol- 
lows: 

- The members of the league under- 
take to exchahge full and frank in- 
formation as to the. Scale of their 
armaments, their militarg, naval and 
| air programs and the condt of such 
of their industries as. are table to 
warlike purposes ~*~ .* 
In the ‘matter of manufacture of mu- 

eo by private enterprise, 
‘though the-pfesident did not secure his 


‘full progfam, ' yet there is an advance 
. over anything im the past. The president 


had taken a pesitive stand on this subject 
in his original covenant. “The contracting 
powers further agree that munitions and 
implements of war shall not be mann- 
factured by private enterprise or for pri- 
vate profit.” This oceasioned considerable 
discussion; it. would place weak nations, 
with little industrial development, at the 
mercy of great nations. The provision 
was cut out of one draft of the covenant, 
restored in another by the president’s mo- 
tion, and it finally appears im the treaty 
as follows: ¢ | 
The members of the league agree 
that tht manefacture by private -en- 
terprise of munitions and implements 
of war is epen to grave objections. 
The councii shall advise how the evil 
effects attendant upon such .mantr- 
facteare can be prevented, due regaré 
being had to the necessities of these 
members of the league which are not 
able to manufacture the munitions 
ahd implements of war necessary for 
their safety. 

Net only are there these gains in deal- 
ing with concrete aspects of the probiem 
of disarmament, but the treaty sets up 
machinery which hag been used to bring 
the subject of limitation of armaments 
the attention of the whole world. Thi 
provision is in Article 10 of the covenant; 
which was originally presented (by Lord 
Robert Cecil) as a compromise with the 
French demand for an international gen- 
eral staff. It provides that “a permanent 
commission shall be constituted: to advise 
the council on the execution of Articles 1 
and 8, on military, naval and air questions 
generally.” This permanent --commission 
was named at the Rome meeting of the 
council in May, 1920, and its first work 
was not to draw up plans for the use of 
league forces, ag the French desired, but 
to set up inquiries regarding limitation of 
armaments as the council is empowered 
te do under Article &. : 


DISARMAMENT (tS 
CONDITION OF PEACE. 

NOTHER important general gain lies 

in the formal acknowledgement by all 

the nations signatory to the treaty that 
the general limitation of armaments is 
one of the conditions of the peace. This 
originated in a proposal by PreSident Wil- 
son on April 26 for a preamble to the 
military, naval and air clauses of the 
treaty, which now appears on page 78 of 
the document. This was the colloquy in 
the secret minutes: 

’ PRESIDENT WILSON suggested 
that it would make the naval, military 
and air terms more acceptable to the 
enemy if they were presented as pre- 


.the most important 


ker first obligation.”

chiefly concerned and in which Ameri- 
can principles and program came most 
directly into conflict with French fears 
and needs; but thera were also other v:tal 
problems of. disarmament, notably naval 
armament where. British, Japanese and 
American interests appear, disarmament 
of small nations, methods of dealing with 
the new instrumentalities of war, and, 
finally, the problem of arming negroes, 
all of which will be treated in the follow-

EW YORK —(Special Corre- 

spondence.)—In the days of our 

mothers a wedding gown used 

to go off like a rocket, It was 

so separated from the clothes of 

every day, so intensely ceremonial in its 

contours and texture, that it could seldom 

be mustered out for post-wedding service. 

At times it was made over, but this re- 

modeling was so patent you could always 

tell what one flippant young bride called 
an “altar-ation:” 

Today the wedding gown is usually an 

intensely wearable garment. This is due to 


“the fact of an expanded range of fabric 
_ possibilities and to our modern tendency 
toward making the dress for the impor- 
. tant day a reflection of other modes. Of 
~ eourse, we are fortunate in the latter re- 
_ spect. For our every-day modes, bor- 
“rowed from classic drapes, from. long 
waisted medieval gowns, and from either 
Spanish of Second Empire full skirted 
fashions, are infinitely better adapted to 
the pageant of the bridal procession than 
were the every-day fashions of, say, 1900, 


For today’s page I have selected a 
medieva] gown of- silver cloth adapted 
from a model of Lanvin’s. I selected this 
with what I admit to be a mental bias. To 
my mind there is nothing more stately, 
more fitting to the drama of the day, than 
these medieval gowns. Yet by choosing 
this mode one pays no toll to Hymen. For 
the gown when dismantled is perfectly 
adapted to any ordinary function. 


The model opens in front to show the 


same silver lace forming the cuffs of the 


plpa 


wear long white glace gloves. 


BRIDE in silver cloth and silver lace is attended at the left by a 

matron of honor in blue satin draped with lavender lace, girdled with 
silver ‘metal, and ‘wearing a hat of silver cloth decked with gray uncurled 
ostrich tipped with silver. At the right a bridesmaid in rose taffeta, with 
appliqued flowers of the same material, establishes a relation between the 
other bridesmaid in blue taffeta, trimmed a little differently with the same 
flowers of self material, by a lavender taffeta hat and a boquet of violets. 
Both gowns have a touch of silver thread on their trimming. All attendants 


long, tight sleeves, and revealed by the 
shortness of the skirt in the back. Silver 
cord marks the natural waist line, while 
a wide girdle of self material dipping down 
in front produces the emphasis on the 
moyenage contour. A cowl collar is used 


here, but for this may be substituted, of 


course, the more . conventional . bateau 


_ Shaped neck line. In conjunction with the 


gown is a cloud of white tulle fixed to 


@ wreath of orange blossoms in.a design 


which recalls poignantly, as the dress it- 
‘self, the Florence where Botticelli painted 
and the De Medicis held their court. 
This same frock may be carried out, 
A white 


satin brocade, for example, would be 
beautiful. However, the “silver wedding” 
has been pushed forward twenty-five 
years, and every season there are more 
brides who decide upon the glittering 
metallic cloth in. preference to white. 
Frequently the silver is confined merely 
to trimming, however, witness to which 
fact is found in numerous lovely white 
tulle frocks made in Second Empire style 
which introduce silver ribbon to edge 
bodice and skirt flounces. One of such 


of course, in other materials. 


frocks, inspired by a model from Laavin, 
has a quaint bertha defining the off the 
shoulder line, and this is encircled by a 
garland of tiny silver rosebuds made of 
ribbon and repeated at the hem of the 
long, wide skirt. 


These Second Empire bridal frocks 
nearly always have short sleevd \-often 
of the puff variety. In other modes, how- 
ever, one observes a growing inclination 
for the long sleeve. - In this connection 
one recalls the beautiful wedding gown 
which was designed this autumn by Poiret 
for his niece. This gown, echoed here in 
America by several fashionable establish- 
ments, had a jong, rather tight fitting 
corsage with a bateau neck line and a 
circular skirt which, gathered over the 
hips, nearly touched the floor. The sleeves 
were long and bell shaped, and they flared 
over puffs of white mousseline, reaching 
well down over the wrist. But the design 
of this frock was really subordinate to 
the material, which was a marvelous piece 
of white satin brocade in which doves ap- 
peared in relief bolder than the floral de- 
sign where they were entrenched 


This mode points not only to the long

sleeve, but to the circular skirt. .This late 
ter, like spring, is coming slowly down 
our way. And it is undoubtedly true that 
many April brides are bound to appear in 
this mode. 

The veil and its fastening leave us free 
nowadays for much self-expression. One 
of the most popular fashions in this acces- 
sory at present consists of the Spanish 
comb in white over which is draped—in a 
way picturesque as the mantijla of Barce- 
lona—the long tulle veil. Sometimes the 
comb is supplanted by a stiff piece of 
lace imitating its contours, Another mode 


.—and this was suggested by M., Poiret—is 


to fit the veil closely to the head by means 
of orange blossoms and then, permitting 


~ the face to show through an opening in 


the veil, drop a front length of tulle to 
the hip line. In the back, of course, the 
veil is as long as the skirt. 

For the brida] party velvet has regis« 
tered just as strongly as it has at other 
social events. Thus, Miss Adelaide Kip 
Rhinelander was attended ater marriage 
last month by a maid of honor in dar§ 
red velvet and by six bridesmaids ig 
king’s blue velvet. All of these wore hats, 
shoes and stockings to match, and even 
the ribbons tying their bouquets were in- 
cluded in this harmony. However, mang 
brides continue to insist upon more vas 
riety, and for those of this mind we sug» 


gest the costumes shown today. This 
color scheme has been worked out in the 
orchid tones, which will probably always 
be favored for the wedding party. The 
bridesmaids’ frocks may be of either taf- 
feta or f9’lle.

midable crew, long of hair and brilliant 


as to bandannas, while the announcer’ 


thundered through his megaphone. 

“La-a-a-dies- and gen’T’mun! You see 
before you the greatest band of subduers 
and breakers of wild horses that ever rode 
a cattle ranges. Death defying, reck- 
ess, 
tend failed; they have never ptiled

“From the wildest regions of the range

fight for pleasure; they buck by instinct.

~ Phe announcer was bellowing: “These

broker, beaten into submission in fair 
fight by the greatest set of horse break- 
ers that ever wore spurs. They can ride 
anything that walks on four feet and 
wears a skin; they can—” 

Werther sprang to his feet, made a 
funnel of his hand and _ shouted: 
“Yi-fi-ip!” ~ 

If he had set off a great quantity of 
red fire he could not more effectively have 
drawn all eyes upon him. The weird, 
shrill yell cut the ringmaster short, 
a pleased murmur ran through the crowd. 

“Partner,” shouted Werther, brushing 
away the big hand of Drew which would 
have pulled him down into his seat, “I’ve 
seen you bluff for. two nights hand run- 
ning. There ain’t no man can Dbieff all 
the world three times straight.” - 

The ringmaster retorted in his great 
voice: “That sounds like good poker. 
W hat’s your game?” - 

“Five hundred dollars on one card!” 
cried Werther, and he waved a fluttering 
handful of greenbacks. “Five hundred 
-dollars to any man, of your lot--or to any 
man in this house than can ride a real 
- wild horse.” 

“Where’s your horse?” 

“Areund the corner in a 26th street 
‘gtable. FI have him here in five min- 
utes. 

“Lead him on,” cried the. ringmaster, 
but his voice was not quite so loud. 

In a little less than five minutes the 
doors at the end of the arena were thrown 
wide and Werther reappeared. Behind 
him came two stalwarts leading between 
them a Tangy monster. Before the blast 


of lights and the murmurs of the throng. 


the big stallion reared and flung himself 
back; the two who led him bore down 
‘ with all their weight on the halter ropes. 
New York burst into applause. 

3 The fury of the stallion, searching on 
all sides for a vent but distracted from 
_ one torment to another, centered suddenly 
on this slender figure. He swerved and 
rushed for the barrier with ears flat back 
. and bloodshot eyes.. There he reared and 
struck at the wood with his great front 
hoofs: the boards splintered and shiver: 
ered under the blows. 

As for the youth in the bex, ion re- 
mained quietly erect. before this brute 
rage. A Meck of red foam fell on the 
white front of his shirt. “He drew his 
handkerchief and wiped i calmly away, 
but a red stain remained. 

For the slender young fellow. in eve- 
ning dress at whom the stallion had rushed 
a moment before was stripping off his 
‘coat, his vest, and rolling up the stiff 
cuffs of his sleeves. Then he dropped a 
hand on the edge of the box, vaulted light- 
ly into the arena, and walked — to- 
ward the horse.

Anthony Woodbury shook his shoul-

a pugilist coming out of his cOrnér to- 
ward an opponent of unknown prowess. 

“Take off the blinder,” he ordered. 

it was Werther who interposed this 
time with: “Look_here, lad, I know this 
hoss. The minute the blinder’s off he'll 
up on his hind legs and bash you into the 
floor with his forefeet.” 

But taking the matter into his own 
hands Woodbury snatched the coat from 
thé head of the stallion, which snorted 


' and reared up, mouth agape, ears flattened 


back. There was a shout from the man, 
not a cry of dismay, but a ringing battle 
yell like some ancient berserker sceing 
the first flash of swords in the melee. He 
leaped. forward jerking down on the bridle 
reins with all the force of his weight and 
his spring. The horse, caught in mid-air, 
as it were, came floundering down on all 


’ fours again. Before he could make an-

horn of the saddle and vaulted up to his 
seat

as he mounted. Over neck and shoulder 
and tender flanks he whirled the lash; it 
was not. intelligence fighting brute

The horse responded, furivusly he re-

The swaying forward of the mighty

ring of the voice, was like the crashing of

The eyes of the gray man half closed

on the fingers of his son. 

“Well, Anthony, tell me about  to-

The son obeyed, and finally said, with.

tly to him.

t CHAP. IV—John Bard. ‘. 

“It will explain why I changed my clothes 
after I came home. You see, toward the 
end of the show a lot of cowboys rede in. 


The ringmaster was announcing that they 
could ride anything that walked on four 
feet and wore a skin, when up jumped 
an oldish fellow in a box. opposite mine 
and shouted that he had ai horse 
which none of them could mount. 
offered five hundred dollars to the man who 
could back him; and made it good by going 
out of the building and coming back inside 
of five minutes with two men leading a great 
stallion, the ugliest piece of ho esh I’ve 
ever seen. 

“As they worked the brute down the arena, 
it caught sight of my white shirt, I suppose, 
for it made a dive at me, reared up, and 
smashed its forehoofs against the barrier. 
By Jove, a regular maneater! Brought my 
heart into my mouth to see the big devil 
raging, and I began to yearn to get astride 
him and to—well, just fight te see which of 
us would come out on top. You know?” 

The big man moistened his lips; he was 
strangely excited. 

“So you climbed into the arena and rode 
the horse?” 

“Exactly! I knew you'd understand! Aft- 
er I’d ridden the horse to a standstill and 
climbed off, a good many e gathered 
around me. One of them was a big man, 
about your size. In fact, now that I leo 
back at it, he was a good deal like you in 
more ways than one; looked as if time had 
hardened him without making him brittle. 
He came to me and said: ‘Excuse me, son, 
but you look sort of familiar to me. Mind 
telling me who your mother was? What 
eould I answer to a—”  . 

A shadow fell across Anthony from the 
rising height of his father. As he looked 
up he saw John Woodbury nee Ys on 
first toward the French windows and then 
at the door of the secret room. 

“Was that all, Anthony.” 

“Yes, about all.” 

For a few minutes neither spoke. Anthony 
leoked up and th the windows teward 
the bright night which lay over the gardens 
and terraces outside, for a full moon sil- 
vered all with a flood of light. It was a 
waiting time, and into it the old-fashioned 
‘Dutch cleck in the corner sent its voice 
with a momentous, softly clanging toll of 
seconds, until Anthony forgot the moonlight 
over the outside terraces to watch the grad- 
ual sway of the pendulum. 

Then through the silence came a call. 


Once more, and this time it was unmis- 


takably clear: “John Bard—Jehn Bard, 
come out to me!” 

The big, gray man rose with widely star- 
ing eyes as if the name belonged to him, 
and strodé with a thum step into the 
secret room. Hardly had the clang of the 
closing door died out when he re ; 
fumbling at his throat. Straight to Anthony 
he came and extended a key from which 
dangled a piece of thin silver chain. It was 
the key to the secret room. 

Anthony took it in beth hands, like a 
knight receiving the pommel of his sword 
‘from him who had just given the accolade, 
end stared down at it until the creaking of 
the opened French windows startled him to 
his feet. 

“Wait!” he called. “I will go also.” 

The big man at the open window turned. 

“You will sit where you are now,” said his 
harsh voice, “but if I don’t return, you have 
the key to the room.” 

His burly shoulders disappeared down the 
steps toward the garden, and Anthony 
slipped back into his chair; yet for the first 
time in his life he was dreaming of disobey- 
ing the command of John Woodbury. Wood- 
bury—yet the big man had risen automati- 
cally in answer to the name of Bard. John 
Bard! It struck on his consciousness like 
two hammer blows wrecking some fragile 
fabric; it jarred home like the timed biew 
of a pugilist. Woodbury? There might be 
a thousand men capable of that name, but 
there could only be one John Bard, and that 
was he who had disappeared down the steps 
leading to the garden. Anthony swerved in 
his chair and fastened his eyes on the Dutch 
elock. He gave himself five minutes before 
he should move. The last minute Anthony 
spent at the open French window with a 
backward eye on the clock; then he raced 
down the steps as though in his turn he 
answered a call out ef the night. 

In the smooth shaven center of a hollow 

he finally saw two tall men standing back 
to back, like fighters come to a last stand 
and facing. a crowd of fees. They separated 
at once, striding out with a measured step, 
and it was not until they moved that he 
caught the glint of metal at the side of one 
of them and knew that one was the man who 
had answered to the name of John Bard and 
the other was the gray man whe had spoken 
to him at the Garden the night befere. 
_ As if they had reached the end of an 
@greed course, the two men whirled at the 
‘®ame instant, the metal in their hands glint- 
ed in an upward semi-circle, and twe guns 
barked hoarsely across the lawns.

Anthony ssed his head against the 

of John Bard, and it seemed to him

He had no chance to bind the wound, for 
John Bard opened his eyes again and said, 
as if in his dream he had still continued 
his tale to Anthony:

He did not hear the answer, for he mur-

“Even Joan would forgive,” and died. 


CHAP. V—Blacbeard’s Room. 

As Anthony Woodbury, he knelt beside 
the dying. As Anthony Bard he rose with the 
dead man in his arm, a mighty burden even 
for his supple strength; yet he went stag- 
gering up the slope, across a level terrace 
and back to the house. There it was Peters 
who answered his call, Peters with a flabby 
face grown gray, but still the perfect 
servant who asked no questions. Together 
they bore the _—" up stairs and placed it 
on John Bard’s bed. While Anthony kept his 
steady vigil by the dead man, it was Peters 
who summoned the police and the useless 
doctor. 

To the old, uniformed sergeant, Anthony 
told a simple lie. His father had gone for 
a walk through the ounds because the 
night was fine, and Anthony was to join him 
later, but when he arrived he found a dying 
man who could not even explain the man- 
ner of his death. 

Left alone, Anthony Bard went to the 
secret room. The key fitted smoothly into 
the lock. What the doer opened upon was a 
little gray apartment with an arched ceil- 


‘ing, a place devoid of a single article of 


furniture save a straight-back chair in the 
center. Otherwise Anthony saw three 
things—two pictures on the wall and a little 
box in the corner. 

First he took up the box, as being by far 
the most promising of the three to give 
him what he wished to know 


held only two things: a piece of dirty silk 
and a small oil can; but the oil can and the 
black smears on the silk made him look 
in a flare, as the glow of a match 
suddenly illumines, even if faintly, an entire 


gar

walked ou prepared.

He jerked his head up, at last, and flashed a 
giance over his shoulder. 
in the smile 
with which she stared down te him from 
her frame, down to him and past him as if 
she scorned in him all men forever. It was 
not that which made Anthony close his eyes. 
.He was trying with all his might to con- 
jure up his own image vividly. He leaked 
again, comparing his picture with this por- 
trait an the wall, and then he knew why the 
gray man at the Garden had said: “Son, 
who’s your mother?” For this was she mteo 
whose eyes he now stared. 

She had the same deep, dark eyes, the 
same black hair, the same rather acquiline, 
thin face which her woman’s eyes and love- 
ly mouth made beautiful, but otherwise the 
same. His was simply a copy of that head 
hewn with a rough chisel—a sculptor’s clay 
model rather than a smoothly finished re- 
production. ni 

To the second picture he turned with a 
deeper hope, but his heart fell at once, for ail 
he saw was an enlarged photograph, two 
mountains, re in the distance, and 
in the foreground, a mighty pine with 
the branches lopped smoothly from the side 
as though some tremendous ax had trimmed 
it; behind this a ranch house and farther 
back the smooth waters of a lake. 

West it must be, but where? North or 
south? West, and from the west surely 
that gray man from the Garden had come, 
and from the west John Bard himself. 
Those two mountains, spearing the sky with 
their sharp horns— they would be the pole 
by which steered his course. 


CHAP.—VI—“This Plate for Rest.” 


As the white heat of midday passed and 
the shadows lengthened more and more 
rapidly to the east, the sheep moved out from 
he shade and from the tangle of the brush 
to feed in the open, and the dogs, which had 
laid one on either side of the man, rose 
and trotted out to recommence their vigil; 
but the shepherd did not change his position

He swung again into the saddle and trotted 
whistling down the slope toward the_ creek 
which gan had ‘pointed out. But once 
fairly out of sight in the second- | for- 
est, he veered sharply to the right, touched 
his tough cattle-pony with the spurs, 
headed at a racing pace straight for the old 
ruined house. 

Even from a distance the house appeared 


unmistakably done for, but not until he came > 


close at hand could Bard appreciate the full 
extent of the ruin. Every individual board 
sppenres to he rotting and crumbling toward 
the grourd, awaiting the shake of one fierce 

t wind to disappear in a cloud of mouidy 
- omg He left his horse with the reins 
hanging.over its head behind the house and 
ente by the back door. 

At last he reached a habitable room in 
the front of the house. It was a new shell 
built inside the old wreck, with four ut 
corner-posts supporting cross-breams, ich 
in turn held up the mouldering roof. In the 
center was a rude table and on either side a 
bunk built against the wall. Perhaps this 
was where Drew lived on the occasions of 
his visits to the old ranchhouwse. 

Out of the gloom of the place, Bard stepped 
with a shrug of the shoulders, like one who 
shakes off the = of a nightmare. He 
strode through the doorway and took the 
oo warm sun cif the afternoon full in his 
ace. 

He found himself in front of the only 
spot on the entire premises which showed the 
slightest care, the mound of a grave under 
the shelter of two trees whose branches were 
interwoven overhead in a soft of impromptu 
roof. From the surface of the mound all the 
weeds and grasses had been carefully clear- 
ed away, and around the edge ran a path 
covered with vel and sand. It was a 
well-beaten mb ape the — of heels still

The headstone itself bore not a vestige of 
moss, but time had cracked it diagonally aad 
the chiseled letters were weathered away. 
He studied it with painful care, poring in- 
tently over each faint impression. He whe 
eared for the ve had apparently been 
troubled only to keep the stone free from dirt 
—the lettering he must have known by heart. 
At length Bard made out this inscription:

She Chose This. Place for Rest. 


CHAP. VII—A Bit of Stalking. 


It seemed as if the peaceful afternoons of 
Logan were ended forever, for the next day 
the scene of interruption was repeated under 
almost identical circumstances, save that 
the tree under which the shepherd sat was 
a little larger. tr also was the man who 
rode over the brow of the hills to the 
east, a mighty figure, deeply-chested, amply 
shouldered. 

At sight of him Logan so far bestirred 
himself as to uncoil his long legs, rise, and 
stand with one shoulder propped against the 
tree 


“Evening, Mr. Drew,” he called. 

“Hello. Logan. How's everything with 
you ?” 

“Busy. Lots of company lately, Mr. Drew. 

“Company ?” 

“Yes, there’s a young feller come along 
who says he wants to see you. He’s over 
there by the creek now, fishin’ I think. .I 
told him I’d holler if I seen you, but I guess 
you wouldn’t mind ridin’ over that way your- 
self.” « 

Drew brought his horse to a halt. 

“What does he want of me?” 

“Dunno. Something about wanting to 
hunt and fish on your streams here. Wants 
to bunk in the old house, too. Seems sort of 
interested in it. 

“That so? What sort of a fellcw is he?’ 
“Pretty keen—dark, thin face, black ey 
A bit talky. Green; but he rides damn well. 

“I'll go over to him,” said Drew, and start- 
ed at a trot for the creek. 

But no sooner had the trees screened him 
thoroughly from the eycs of Logan than he 
abandon his direct course for the creek. 
He swung from the saddle with an ease sur- 
prising in a man of such age and bulk and 
tossed the reins Ger the bead of the horse. 

Then he comntenced -a cautious stalking 
through the woods, silent as an Indian, 
stealthy of foot, with eyes that glanced 
sharply in all directions. He worked his 
way up the course of the steam until he 
came in sight of a figure far \ ; thretigh the 


trees.

But I can cook you up some chow.” 

In the shack of the house he placed the

ham and making coffee. This with crackers, 
formed the meal. He watched Nash eat for 
a moment of solemn silence and then the 
foreman looked up to catch a meditative 
chuckle from the youngster. 

“Let me in on the joke, son.” 

“Nothin’. I was just thiinkin’ of pa.” 

“What's he sore about?

“It was the best horse pa ever had, too. 
It was a piebald pinte called Jo. He’s one of 
them hosses that likes oT: When he 
leaves the corral he likes to ha 
hoss for a runnin’ mate and he was jest as 
tame as anything. I ceuld ride him; anybody 
could ride him. But if you took him out- 
side the bars of the corral without company, 
first thing he done was to see one of the 
other hosses was comin’ out .to join him. 
When he seen that he was all laid out to 
make a trip by himself-he jest: nacherally 
started in to raise hell. . Which Jo can raise 
more hell for his size than any hoss I ever

“Whenever the .boys around here wanted

“First the gy oe takes a: look over his

didn’t see none.’ Then the circus started. 
“There ain’t enough words in. the Bible 
to describe. what he done. Which maybe 


you sort of gather that he had to keep on-

in the saddle. He was. An’ he never pulled

he had when he got the saddle. But pretty

that it didn’t de him ne particular harm te

“The minute he seen that he stopped 
fightin’ and started off at a gallop the way

was over there. But you're lookin’ sort of 
sleepy, stranger?” 

“Il am,” answered Nash. “D’ you mind if 
I turn in on that bunk ovor there ?” 

“Help yourself,” said the boy. 


CHAP. X—Lemonade. 


At the end of three hours Nash awoke as 
sharply as though an alarm were clamoring 
at his car. A single yawn and stretch and he 
was again on ‘his feet. Since the boy was not 
in sigut he cooked himself an enormous meal, 
devoured it, then mounted his mustang. He 
now swung more to the right cutting across 
the hilis, for he presumed that by this time 
the tenderfoot must have gotten his bear- 
ings and would head straight for Eldara. It 
was a stiff two-day journey, now, the whole 
first day’s riding having been a worse than 
useless detour. 

At noon, the second day, he reached the 
eross-roads saloon and general store of one 
Bill Flanders. He swung from the sad- 
dle, tossed the reins over the head ef the 
mustang, made a stride forward—and then 
checked himself with a soft curse and reach- 
ed for his gun. | 

For the door of the bar dashed open and 
down the steps rushed a tall man with light 
yellow mustache, so long that it literally 
blew on either side over his shoulders as he 
ran; in either hand he carried a revolver— 
a two-gun man, fleeing, perhaps, from an- 
ether murder. . 

For Nash recognized in him a character no- 
torious through a thousand miles of the 
range, Sancy Ferguson, nicknamed by the 
eolor of that famous mustache, which was en- 
vied and dfeaded so far and so wide. 

There were unmistakable signs in Sendy 
himself of what would have been called ar- 
rant terror in any other man. At the same 
moment the door opened and the perspiring 
figure of little Bill Flanders appeared. is 


revolver. He made a gesture. with that 
armed hand, and Sandy winced as though a 
whiplash had flicked him. * ex. 

“Steady up, damn your eyes!” bellowed 
Flanders. “Climb your hoss and beat it, and 
if I ever find you in reach again, I'll send 
my kid out to rope you and give you a hoss- 
whippin’.” 

The gun fighter lost no time. A _ single 

leap carried him into his saddle and he was 
off over the sand with a sharp rattle of the 
beating hoofs. 
- “Partner,” Nash said gravely to Flanders, 
“I've always prided myself on having eyes a 
little better than the next one, but just now 
I guess I must of been sein’ double. Seemed 
to me that that was Sandy Ferguson that 
you hot-footed out’ of that door—or has 
Sandy got a double ?” 

“Nope,” said the other, wiping the- last 
of the perspiration from his forehead, “that’s 
Sandy, all right. 

“All of which means,” suggested Nash, 
“that Sandy has been licked ?” 

“Licked? No, he ain’t been licked, but 
he’s been plumb annihilated, washed off. the 
map, cleaned out, faded, rubbed into the 
dirt; if there was some stronger way of put- 
tin’ it, I would. And the feller that downed 
Sandy was—a tenderfoot. Yep, a greenhorn. 
Said his name was Anthony Bard.” 

“Ah-h-h,” drawned Nash softly, “I thought 
so. Let’s hear the story, Flanders.” ~ 

“It was like this. Along about evening of 
yesterday Sandy was in here with a couple 
of other boys. He was pretty well ligh

more’n six inches. -But it slammed Sandy 
down in a corner like he’s been shot. 

“He was too surprised to be much hurt, 
though, and. drags himself up to his feet, 
makin’ a pass at his pocket at the same time. 
Then he came again, silent and thinkin’ of 
blood, I -s’pose, with a-knife in his hand. 

“This. time the tenderfoot didn’t wait. He 


went in with a sort of hitch step, like a;: 


dancer. Ferguson’s knife carved the air be- 
side the tenderfoot’s head, and: then the 
skinny boy jerked up ‘his right and his left 
—one, two—into Sandy’s mouth. Down he 
goes again—slumps down as if all the bones 
rs his body was busted—right down on his 
ace. 

“When Sandy conte to he got up to his

and scooped ’em up, with the eye of the ten- 
derfoot on him all the time—scooped ‘em 
up—stood with ’em all ptdised—and so he 
backed out through the door. It wasn’t any 
pretty thing to see. 

“So that’s how Sandy Ferguson went under 
the sod.” : 


CHAP. XI—The Darkness in Eldara. 


Even the stout roan grew weary during 
the third day, and when they topped the last 
rise of hills, and looked down to darker 
shadows in Eldara in the black heart of the 
hollow, the mustang stood with hanging head 
and one ear flopped forward. Cruel indeed 
had been the pace which,Nash maintained, 
yet they had nevér been able to overhaul the 
flying piebald of Anthony Bard. 

Coming down the main street—for Eldara 
boasted no fewer than three thoroughfares— 
the first houses which Nash passed showed 
no lights. As far as he could see, the blinds 
were all drawn;  not'even the glimmer. of a 
candle showed, and the voices which he 
heard were muffied.and low. Even Butler’s 
saloon was closed! He rode up to a shut- 
tered window and kicked it with his heel. 

A faint voice called: “Who's there?” 

“Steve Nash. - What the devil’s turned 
Eldara inte a cemetery, Butler?” 

The boards of the. shutter stirred, opened, 
so that the man within could look out. 

“Cemetery’s right. *“‘Butch’ Conklin and his 
ing to raid the place tonight. 

ied man in town is out in the 


hit town with their guns going.” 
- “What happened?” 

“Butch came in town roaring drunk, which 
xt nerally is, but he wasn’t giving neo 

uble at all, and nobody felt particular 
called on to cross him and ask questions. 
Everybody was treatin’ Butch like he was the 
ki of the earth and not passin’ out any 
back-talk, all except one tenderfoot—” 

But here a stream of tremendous profanity 
burst from Nash. . 

“Is that damned fool in Eldara?” - 

“—D’ you know him?” . 

“No. Anyway, go on. What hapepned?” 

“I was’sayin' that Butch was feelin’ pretty 
sociabie. It went all right in the bars. He 
was in here and didn’t do nothin’ wrong. 
Even paid for all the drinks for everybody 
in the house, which nobody could ask more 
even from a white man. But then Butch got 
hungry and went up the street to Sally For- 
tune’s place. and called for ten dollars’ 
worth of bacon and eggs—which there hasn’t 
been an egg in Eldafa this week. Sally, she 
told him, not being afraid even -of Butch. 
He got prety sore at that and said that it 
res a frame-up and everyone was ag’in’

“Then this Bard—we found out later that 
was his name—walks in, takes a table; and 
not being served none too quick, he walks

piano. Out she starts with a piece of

“Them was the words he used, Steve, hon- 
est to God. Used them to Butch! 

“Well, Butch reaches for his gun and we 
all dive for the door, but me being: held up 
on account of my missing leg,I was siow an’ 
couldn’t help seein’ what happened. Butch 
was fast, but the young feller was faster. He 
had Butch by the wrist before the gun came 
clear—just gave a little twist—and there he 
stood with the gun in his hand pointin’ into 
Butch’s face, and Butch sittin’ there like a 
feller in a trance or wakin’ up out of a bad 
dream. 

“Then Butch gets up, slow and dignified, 
though he had enough liquor in him to float 
a ship. 

“‘I been mobbed,’ he says, ‘it’s easy to see 
that. I come here peaceful and: quiet, and 
here I been mobbed. But I’m comin’ back, 
boys, and I ain’t comin’ alone.’ ; 

“There was our chance to get him, while he 
was walking out of that place without a gun, 
but somehow nobody moved for’him. He 
didn’t look none too easy, even without his 
shootin’ irons. Out he goes into the night,

Eyerybody was. upset, except Sally'and Bard. 
The piano was still playin’. and, 

‘Miss Fortune, this is our dance, I think.’ 

“*Exeuse me,’ says Sally, ‘I atwiost forgot

“And they started to dance to the piano, 
waltzin’ around among the tables; the rest 
of us lit out for home because we knew that 
Butch would be on his way with his gang 
before we got very far under cever. But 
hey, Steve, where you goin’?” : 

“’m going to get in on that dance,” called 
Nash, and was gone at a racing gallop down 
the street. 


and bews. He says: 


CHAP. XII—Bluff. 
He found no dance in progress, however, 
bat in the ‘otherwise empty eatin 
which Sally owned and ran with her two 


capable hands and the assistance of a cook, . 


sat Sally herself dining at the same table 


with the tenderfoot, the horse-breaker, the 


tamer of gun-fighters. 

“Hello!” he* called. ' 

“It’s old Steve!” sang out Sally, and. whirl- 
ing from her chair, she advanced almost at a 
run to met him, caught him by both hands, 
and led him to’a table next to that at which 
she had been sitting. 

“My old pal, Steve Nash,” said Sally, “and 
this is Mr. Anthony Bard.” ri 

Just the faintest accent fell on the “Mr.,” 
but it made Steve wince. He rose and shook 
hands gravely with the tenderfoot. | 

“I stopped at Butler’s place down the 
street,” he said, “and* been hearin’ a pile 
about’a little play you made a while ago. It 


was about time for somebddy to ‘call ,old 


Butch’s bluff,’ 


Sally resumed her place opposite Bard. 

“Steve,” she said, with a quiet venom, 
“that bluff of his has been as good as four-of- 
a-kind with you for a long time. I never seen 
you make any play at Butch.” |. 

He returned amiably: “Like to sit here and 
have a nice social chat, Sally, but I got to be 
gettin’ back to the ranch, and in the mean- 
time, I’m sure hungry.” . 

At the reminder of business a green light 
came in the fine blue eyes: of Sally. They 
were her only really fine features, for the 
nose tilted an engaging trifle, the mouth was 


a little too generous, the chin so strong that _ 


it gave, in thoments of passivity, an air of 
sternness to@her face. Shé turned back 
toward Bard. re | 

“Sorry I got to go—before I finished ‘eat- 
ing—but business is business.” 

“Oh, Steve,” called the voice of Sally 
from the kitchen a moment later. 

In the kitchen Sally spoke to him without 
prelude. : | 

“I want you to do something for me.” 

He said suspiciously: “It’s got something 
to do with the tenderfoot in the room out 
there ?” a : 

It was a palpable hit, for she colored 
shexply. Then she took the bull by the 

orns. 


“I want you to see that Bard gets safe 


out of this town.” 
“Sure. Nothing I’d rather do,” 
She tilted her head a little to one side and 
regarded him wistfully. 
Are you double-crossin’ me, Steve?” 
“Why. d’you suspect me? Haven't I said 
I'd do it?” 
“Shake.” 


Back in the eating room found the ten-. 


derfoot finishing his coffee. The latter kept 
an eye frank suspicion upon him. So the 
silence held for a brooding moment, until 
Bard asked: “D’you know the way to the 
ranch ef William Drew?” 

It was a puzzler to Nash. Was not that 
his job,. to . out and bring the man te 
Drew’s place 

He said aloud: “The way? Sure; I work 
on Drew’s place.” 

“You don’t happen te be going back that 
way tonight?” 

“Not all the way; part of it.” 

“Mind if I went along?” 

“Nobody to keep you from it,” said the 
cow-puncher without enthusiasm. 

en the way, what sort of a man is Drew?” 

“He’s a big feller; big and-gray.”. 

“Ah-h-h,” sai dthe other, and drew in his 
breath, as tho he were drinking. 

It seemed to Nash that he had never seen 
such an unpleasant smile. 


CHAP. XIIli—Buatch Returns. 


Sally entered, carrying the meal of the 
cowpuncher, arranged it, and then sat on the 
eee of Bard’s table, turning from one te the 
other. 

“Bard,” stated Nash, “is going out to the 
ranch with me tonight.” 

“Long ride for tonight, isn’t it?” 

“Yes, but we'll bunk on the way and finish 
up early in the morning.” 

Sa'ly turned to the easterner. 

“When do you come back this way, Bard?” 

He said thoughtfully: “Perhaps tomorrow 
night—perhaps—” 

It ought to be tomorrow night,” she said 
pointedly, her eyes on Wash. 

The latter had pushed his chair back a 
trifle and sat now with downward head and 
his right hand resting lightly on his thigh. 
Only the place in which they sat was illum- 
ined by the two lamps, and the forward part 
of the room, nearer the street, was a seat of 
shadows, wavering when the wind stirred the 


. flame in one of the lamps or sent it smoking 


up the chimney. Sally and Bard sat with 
their backs to the door, and Nash half fac-

of an inch which would have meant the dif- - 
ference to poor Conklin.”- : 

“*Poor’ Conklin ? Why, you fish, he was 
sheakin’ in here to try his-hand on you. He . 
found out he couldn’t get his gang. inte.

“I knew—and -this fellow Nash was as — 
quiet as the strike of a snake. If he’d been 
a fraction of a second. slower I might. be - 
where Conklin -is. now. I'll never forget 
Nash for this.” 

She said pointedly: “No, he’s a bad one to 
forget; keep an’ eye on him. You spoke of 
a snake—that’s how smooth Stcve is.” 3 

“Ave all these fellows .something 
than they seem ?”’ : 

“What about yourself?” 

“How do you mean that?’ : ;

warmth and softness of her body reached him,

Butch Conklin looked up, raising his ban-—

with a stain of red growing through the 
cloth: He stared at the two, raised a hand te 
his head as though to rub away the dream, 
found a pain too real for a dream, and then, 
like a crab which has grown almost too old to. 
walk, waddled on hands ‘and knees, slowly 
from the room and melted silently into the 
dark beyond.

A sharp noise of running feet leaped from 
the dust of the street and clattered arene 
the doorway; the two turned. A swarthy 
man, broad of shoulder, was the first, and 
afterward appeared Nash. 

“Conklin?” called. Deputy Glendin, and 
swept. the room with his startled glance. 
“Where's Conklin?” 

“He had enough,” answered. Bard, “his 
share of trouble came tonight; I let him go.”- 

“Young feller,” growled Glendin, “you * 
ain’t been in town a long while, but I’ve 
heard a pile too much about you already. 
What you mean by takin’ the law into your 
own hands?” 

“Wait,” said Nash, his keen eyes on the 
two, “I guess I understand. This feller bein’ 
a tenderfoot, he don’t understand our. ways;.

it is. There ain’t no use blamin’ him; better

‘ THE SUNDAY CONSTITUTION MAGAZINE 


A Bible Talk ::°-: °°: 


HE things it tells of happened 
twenty-eight hundred years ago, 
yet how crammed with lessons 
for us of today is the eighteenth 
chapter of the first book of 
Kings! 


It. continues the fascinating . 


story of that great Biblical char- 
acter, Elijah, begun with such startling 
suddenness in the previous short chapter. 


He had appeared before Ahab, wicked- 
est of the kings of the ten tribes of Israel, 
and foretold a drought as punishment for 
the nation’s sin of idolatry, introduced by 
Jezebel, the king’s strong-minded consort. 


Then, as mysteriously as he had come, he — 


had vanished and been fed by ravens, in 
the morning and in the evening, and from 


the widow’s barrel of meal that wasted © 
not-and the cruse of oi] that did not fail. : 
‘And all the~-while there was sore eee: 


throughout Samaria. 


“And it camié to’pass after many have: 
that the word of the Lord came to Elijah 
inthe third year, saying, Go, shi w thyself - 
unto ‘Ahab;-and I will send rain upon the 
earth.” Thus the chapter of our talk begins. 

As Elijah journeyed towards Ahab’s cap- 
- ital he, met Obadiah, the governor of the 
king’s house, who-not only feared the Lord 
greatly, but he also feared Ahab. When 
Jezebel, worshipper of Baal, was slaying 


the prophets of Israel, he had been loyal 


enough to the Almighty God to save one 
hundred of them-and hide them in cavés 
and feed them; but when Elijah told him 
to go and announce to Ahab his coming, 
Obadiah trembled and explained to the 
prophet that he was afraid to do so lest 
Klijah might vanish again, and then his 
life would pay the penalty for a seemingly 
false report to the king. 


There is so much meat in our chapter 
that we cannot devote much time to Oba- 
diah or to the hundred prophets who hid 
in caves, although this part of it has been 
used as a basis for comment on the lack 
of courage sometimes displayed by min- 
isters who hide from the wrath of the un- 
righteous instead of upbraiding them. 

But allowance must be made for the 
difference in the intensity of convictions. 
Some have conviction enough for ordinary 
times; others have convictions enough for 
every emergency. Such characters as 
Elijah are valuable, therefore, as a reproof 
to those who are weak in the faith and as 
a stimulus to those who have to meet great 
trials. The progréss of Christianity is slow 
because the spirit of. the martyrs is -not 
to be found in all who profess faith. in 
God—not even in all who. openly take upon 
themselves the name of His Son. 


VM HEN Elijah met Ahab, the latter, who 
had searched everywhere for the 
prophet and had even demanded an oath of 
the kingdoms where he failed to find him 
gave expression to his anger in words that 
have become historic: “Art thou he that 
- troubleth ~Israel”—an accusation and “a 
compliment. Why had he hunted far and 
wide for Elijah? Because he believed: that 
Elijah was the spokesman of the Almighty. 
andethat the drought which lay: over his 
kingdom .could not be broken until word 
game from Elijah.- He charged Elijah with 
troubling Israel and yet he knew that 
Elijah was the-only-one through whom ré- 
lief could be brought. . 

Elijah’s answer was in keeping. with the 
character of that great man of God. “I have 
not troubled Israel; but:thou; and thy fa- 
ther’s house, in that ye have forsaken the 
commandments of the Lord and thou hast 
followed Baalim.” 

Thou art the man! There is courage. 
An unarmed prophet of Jehovah—all the 
rest of them had been destroyed or driven 
into hiding, but here is one whom neither 
the frown of the king nor the king’s armies 
could terrify. He had not waited until 
Ahab found him, but went himself to the 
king and, hurling back Ahab’s reproach, ut- 
tered before Ahab God’s indictment of his 
idolatry. , 


Then follows the greatest prayer test 
recorded in history—one of the most 
.sublime acts of faith ever displayed by 
man. 


Taking comnimnd of the situation; Elijah 
ordgred Ahab to assemble the prophets of 
Baal, four hundred and fifty. in number, in 
Mount Carmel, and when these leaders of 
the idolaters assembled Elijah spoke unto 
the people, who had gathered. to witness 
the scene. “How long halt ye between 
two opinions!’ he exclaimed. ‘If the Lord 
be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then fol- 
low him.” 


This. is a practical lesson because it 
touches every human life. This is the 
choice that all are called upon to make. 
From the time we reach years of accounta- 
bility until we die, this is the choice that 
we are continually making—choice be- 
tween God and Baal, between the Heavenly 
Father and the false gods that invite wor-- 
ship—and success or failure follows ac- 
cording to the decision.. 


Elijah did not allow much time for 
them to make up their minds, and but lit- 
tle time is required for this choice, The 
decisions upon which our lives turn are 
made in a moment, whether we turn to 
the right or to the left, we act instantly. 
We may spend time in considering the 

matter, in pondering over it, but only 
@ moment is required for the decision,

HISTORY’S GREATEST PRAYER TEST—

And when ‘all the people saw it, they fell, on their faces ; and they

A 


moment is required for the decision, 
whether. it is to become a murderer, a 
thief, or a criminal or any other kind. And 
it requires no longer to decide, as did the 
Prodigal Son, “I will arise and go to my 
father.” 


_ The people stood mute before Elijah; 
“answered him ‘not a word.” Then the 
prophet proposed the test. 

“I, even I only, remain a prophet of 
the Lord; but - Baal’s prophets are four 


hundred and fifty men, ”" He challenged 
them to bring two bullocks, they to choose 


one and put it on an altar with no fire 


under it; he would take the other bullock 
and do likewise. Then the prophets of 
Baal were to call upon their gods to send 
down fire from heaven to consume the sac- 
rifice, and he would call upon Jehovah; 

“and the God. that answereth by fire, let 
him be God.” 


Imagine, if you can, a more sublime 
picture of trust in-God. Not only was 
Elijah’s -own:’ life. staked upon the resuit; 
but the faith of the children of Israel was 
at stake. 


UT they must be given credit for a 
larger faith than those have who today 

call the Bible a ‘man-made ‘book. 
inspired mén made the Old ‘and New Testa- 
ments, why-do not uninspired men prepare 
‘another Bible?. If the Bible is @ .mati-made 
‘book, surely men-ought-to be able to make 
a better- book today than our Bible: But 
éhe atheist has not as much faith in his 


doctrines as the prophets of Baal twenty-~ 


eight hundred years ago had in their God, 
for the atheist will not attempt the mak- 
ing of a substitute for the Bible. 


Baal did not answer and then Elijah - 


gave additiona] proof of the completeness 
of his trust. He ridiculed the prophets of 
Baal, mocked them: before he nimecit — 


If un- © 


appealed to his God. No man with the - 
’ slightest doubt would haye takea the risk . 
- of laughing at his rivals before the con- 


test was over, but Elijah had unquestion- 
ing faith and he dared to ridicule the ef- 


’ forts of the worshippers of a false god, 


just as today the believers in a personal 
God, in an inspired -Book and in a deified 
Christ mock those who would make the 


Creator impersonal, the Bible a story book | 


and Christ a mere man. 

Then came Elijah’s opportunity, and © 
here again his faith shines forth. 

He was not content .to.call.down fire * 


dry wood as the prophets of Baal-had — 
pen He -had the: wood saturated. three 


‘times with barrels. of Catercyosinty Oe the 


materialists. think it was-oil in disguise, 


_,. but the spectators did not.- Elijah. —. 
; and, what a: modest prayer it was: : 


“Let it-be known this day that thou art 


God in Israel,-and.that Iam thy_seryant, . 


and that I have done all these things at 
thy word.” 


Elijah was the.conduit through which ~ 


~ the power of God flowed; -he was the in- 


strument in Jehovah’s hand. Could humil- 


_ ity be better expressed? 


“BROBNT writer, a professing Chris- 


tian, assumed. to divide the miracles 
into cone groups, the individual to make 
the classification for himself. In one group 


‘ would be the recorded: miracles for which 


there seemed (to the individual) to be no 
sufficient reason;-in the other group would 
be the miracles that might be justified ac- 
cording to the judgment of the individual) 
as necessary. to produce an effect worth 


producing. Even according to this ridicu-° 


lous classification, Elijah’s - prayer. test 
would seem worth while. It was intended 
to destroy faith in idol worship which Jeze- 
bel was introducing .and to take the heart 
of the children of Isra@l back to the God 
of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel. 


“Then the fire of the Lord. fell, and 
consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the 


wood, and the stones, and the dust, and. 


licked.up the water that was in the trench. 


_.And when all the people’saw it, they fell 


on their faces; and they said; “The Lord, 
he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.’” 


We know of the vastness of the uni- 
verse and of the myriad forms-of life, each 
perfect in its mechanism ‘and unquestion- 
ing in its obedience to the law woven into 
its very being. ' Wesee the wonder-working 
of a- power that’ is measureless, designs 


that could only*come from an Infinite In-’ 


telligence, und a bounty that bespeaks the 
fathomless love of a Heavenly Father. We 
have the experience of the ages and proof 
of: Christ’s power to regenerate a world; 
and yet even now it sometimes requires 
a catastrophe to turn the wandering heart 
back to Jehovah. The great lesson of our 
chapter teaches the need of an unwaver- 
ing faith in an unchanging God.

her friend’s arm. “You nice girl!” she said, 
“But why? We were talking about it fast 
night—Betty's wild about it! It’s all de- 
cided! Thank you just the same,-dear!” 

_ Mrs. Mercer looked at her quiet y, 
rather. keenly. “Then that’s that,” she 
said. “I’m glad—the girls would have been 
so disappointed.” she added. “Ana I must 
trot along—I’ve shopping (o, do.” 

Eleanor had a quick inspiration. “0, ao 
give me a lift? I've shoppii g to do, too; a 
lot of it!” 

In the excitement of choosing and buy- 
ing she let the luncheon -hour-go by; Katie, 
she knew, would look-after the children. 
Two new dresses for Betty, a hat, a coat; 
pumps and stockings and a ruffly petticoat 
for the dancing class; a long wished.for 
mackinaw for Alan, and for herself the 
new suit and hat, a set of moderately 
priced furs, gloves, veils, a blouse or two. 
It was long past four when she turned 
into her own street. 

‘Betty was looking’ out of the window 
and came. running to.meet her. “Mother! 
O, mother! Daddy’s home! He’s sick! 
There’s a trained nurse, and: Katie says—” 

Eleanor’s heart seemed to stand still. 
A tearful Katie was in the hall. “O, ma’am,” 
she began; but Eleanor ran past her, up 
the stairs. 

.“John—” 


she faltered. She saw the 


»bity in the doctor’s eyes. 


He nodded. “It’s nothing new, my dear 
girl. He’s had warnings b2ifore—slight at- 
tack3. This was bound to come. John’s 
known it; I’ve known it; and I think he 
made a mistake in not telling you. But he 
would not hear of it. Said he’d keep it 
from you as long as he culd. Woud.’t 
have you worried. I worder the smash 
didn’t come before; nothirg tut his de 
termination to live for you and th:2 chil- 
dren kept him going, in my opinion, And 
he has obeyed us, of course—for I'm not 
the only man he’s seen about it. His heart, 
you know. I told him six yeirs ago that 
he’d not live a month if he didn’t go care- 
fully. But he has, and that’s how he’s done 
it. Took some grit, too. Big, active chap

like that. One cigar a day; never to walk 
quickly, never to run ipstairs, never to 
try to catch a car in a hurry—I had-to tell 
him plainly - that - just once might tinish 
him.” 

“O, why didn’t he tell me; why didn’t 
he tell me!” she moaned. 
He said nothing more, and she was 
aware of the pity and understanding in his 
face; when she had sunk down on her 
knees beside John’s pillow he drew the 
nurse to the window for some whispered 
words and then went out. 


Toward morning, when again she had 


- felt his pulse, the nurse did something 


quickty with a hypodermic; then she ieft 
the room, and Eleanor knew she had gone 
to the-telephone. In what seemed’ an in- 
eredibly short time—so strangely do the 
emotions concerning . themselves * with 
eternity bridge the minutes, Dr, Mercer 
was in the rodm, and Eleanor made way 
for him beside the bed; but still she asked 
nothing, said nothing, looked only at John’s 
face.. After an hour the doctor went away 


- again, and she went back to tlie place near 


his pillow. 


The light in the room ‘changed. - She 
heard Katie go downstairs. Once more 
the nurse came to the bedside, once more 

held John’s wrist while her ores were on 
her watch. 

“His pulse is stronger, Mrs. Tyler,” she 
said. Eleanor looked up at her with dull 
eyes, scarcely comprehending. This ~_ 
calm girl—and herself and John—Jobn . 

“He is sleeping naturally, Mr. Tyler,” 
the nurfe said; and Eleanor’s forehead 
sank to the bed. The nurse left the room; 
Eleanor heard the sounds of breakfast 
downstairs, the careful footsteps of the 
children. The affairs of the house, even of 
Betty and Alan, seemed to concern her 
not at all. : 


Then she knew that John was awake, 
and she raised her head. Now his lips were 
smiling, faintly; she felt his touch on her 
hair. 


“You—will be—provided for—cear.” 
O, she caught the words, caught them

- ‘The hand that held hers tigntened. “The 
bank book—and: the house is—clear. Had . 
to—no other—way.” 

“Don't! O, my~darling!” she said, and 
pressed: her cheek to his. “I understand— 
John!” 

“You always—trusted—didn’t you?” he 
whispered. 

“O, yes, yes!” she cried: “In my heart, 
dear! Not in my foolish mind—lI didn’t un- 
derstand! But what does it matter? Get 
well, John—hold on to life, John—John! 
It’s you I want, not—things.” 

O, that funny, pursed up ‘smile! “My 
girl,” he whispered. 


It seémed countless hours later when 
she once more faced Dr. Mercer in the hall. 
“Well, it’s over for this time, as far as I 
can see, Eleanor,” he said. “Anybody put 
old John—but with *thim—he has the spirit 
that wins through a good deal.” 


She went downstairs © with him, and 
later spoke to the children, to Katie, met 
Claire Mercer, when she came, with eyes 
of courage. 

“Yes, there is something you car do, 
Claire, if you will. Those things from the 
shops—and your: offer’ about Betty’s danc- 
ing class... .” 


“Of course! 1 know just how you feel, 
dear! But Frank says that John—O, you 
mustn’t be too frightened; Eleanor. But ag 
to economy—of course, when there’s ill- 
ness—” 


“Yes,” Eleanor assented. 

O, the world of yesterday and the world

‘them alone, and Eleanor drew up a chair 


and took his hand. They said nothing; 
everything was plain‘between them—hopes 
and fears, the future and the past. And

would not hasten it by mere words. Just 
the dear present was enough.

Homemakers’ Business Bureau : 


Few Changes Made [ 4. Weekly Market Basket 


In Design For 
Table Linen 


HERE would be less grumbling 

over the high cost of living if 

every homemaker would’ = take 
advantage of the genuine bar- 

gain sales. For many years the 

large and reliable shops all over 

the country have held during 

the month of January sales of 
household linens, including towels, table 
linen and bed linen, at which the prices 
are really reduced. . x 
The fact that they are able to crowd 
three months’ trade into four weeks with 
the comparative small, expense of addi- 
tional salesmen make it, possible for them 


te offer good values ‘at lower prices. It. 
is also to the advantages of the stores. 


to get rid of goods of which there is too 
large a supply, to close out old. patterns, 
odd dozens, etc., and to make room for 
the new goods. As there is very little 
change in the designs of table an@ bed 
linen or towels, the customer who buys 
at the sales is gaining for her household 
expenses a real saving. 

Few of us can afford dinner napkins 


at fifty dollars a dozen, yet the home- 
maker handy with her needle can dupli-. 


cate them for about one-third this price. 


LL the new dinner napkins show 22 or 

24-inch size, nothing larger; made of 
fine linen. One set shows the hem hand 
hemstitched, with*a design of the new 
Italian cut work, arrahged cleverly around 
the monogram. The other set had the 
edge of real filet lace 1-4 inch wide, rolled 
and whipped on, ‘The corners showed a 
design of Italian cut work around a three- 
cornered filet medallion. This edging 
may be purchased for about 19 cents per 
yard. and the medallions for 25 cents 
each. During the January sales many at- 
tractive medallions may be purchased 
for mere songs, later to be used in lunch- 
eon cloths, serving table covers and va- 
rious household linens. 

If you are longing for a handsome 
luncheon cloth or dinfng_cioth, watch tae 
sales for linen sheeting, combined with 
filie or Cluny medallions or edging and 
bits of hand embroidery, you wil] have a 
very handsome cloth costing about one- 
third of a ready-made one. It is often dif- 
ficult to tell which is the right side of 
Huckaback toweling. If one draws the 
linen between thumb and finger, one side 
of the goods is distinctly rougher than the 
other. .The rough-feeling side is the right 
side. 

A homemaker 1 know is making her 
comforters in an unusual way. She in- 
closes the cotton batting in mosquito net- 
ting, tacking it here and there. Then 
she slips this into its outside cover. When 
the cover is soiled, it is very easy to rip 
epen one end and remove the wool and 
also as simple to put the whole together 
again. 

LONG towel-rack may be made forthe 
bath room by putting a screw-eye 
into each end of a broom handle and put- 
ting this over two screws which have 
been put on the wall, the same as for a 
sash curtain rod. This is substantial and 
will-hold a number of towels and will not 
rust them. The appearance of this rack 
will be tmproved by painting it with 
white enamel. 

When Mr. Sixfooter complains that his 
blankets pull from the foot of his bed, 
the trouble may easily be remedied. Sew 
a strip of cotton cloth 18 inches wide 
across the bottom of the blanket. This 
may be tucked in under the mattress, 
leaving the full length of the blanket for 
covering. : 


In making a long trip on the train — 


always slip a folding coat-hanger into 
your grip. When the porter brings the 
large paper hat bags just ask for another 
one, which he is always willing to let 
you have. Put your coat on the hanger, 
and, turning one of.the bags upside down, 
slip it over the coat, making @ small slit 
for the hook of the hanger to go through. 
Thus the coat can be hung up in good 
shape and thoroughly protected from dirt 


during the entire trip.

To Provide Variation in Preparing Sau-age 


==m} AUSAGE is one of the most de. 

"Jai lectable of winter relishes, but 

to really enjoy it one” should 

know of what it is made. There 

is no comparison between the 

‘product of one’s own kitchen 

composed of choiee portigns of 

meat, carefully blendéd with 

fresh spices, and thatemystery of myster- 

ies masquerading under the name of sau- 

sage highly seasoned compound of corn 

meal, refuse and fat, half of which van- 
ishes in- cooking. 

‘One ¢an hardly imagine the housekeeper 
of olden times accepting this substitute 
fer the spicy cakes of sausage which she 
served to her family. 

She had advantage over the homemaker 
of today—she was personally acquainted 
with the principal ingredient thereof— 
the family porker—and an assurance of 
his good health. She had gathered ere 
the cold days began, her herbs, sage, 
thyme savory, carefully dried and labeled 


them, taking great pride in their strength. 


and purity. When cold weather arrived 
and Sir Porker had met his fate, the great 
gausage.grinder was brought forth, the 
meat ground, seasoned, packed into cloth 
bags and stored in the attic. 


_ For those who care té make large quan- 


tities of sausage the following recipe is 


given just as it stands in a quaint old 
eook book, from the colonial mansion in 
which this recipe was famous. Its as- 
sembling was never left to the servants, 
but was presided over by the mistress of 
the manor. . 
_PORK SAUSAGE. 

Twenty-five pounds pork, 25 level tea- 
spoons pepper, 5 teaspoons summer sav- 
ory, 1-2 pound salt, 17 teaspoons sage, 3 
teaspoons thyme. 

With the convenient food chopper al 
ways at hand, homemakers of today can 
make their sausage in small quantities 
throughout the winter, as modified by the 
following recipe: . _ 

Five pounds raw fresh pork, 5 tea- 
spoons pepper, 1 teaspoon of summer sav- 
ory, 4 teaspoons salt, 3 1-2 teaspoons sage, 
3-4 teaspoon thyme. xa 

Before starting the sausage, make a 
half-dozen bags of white cctton cloth, 
about 8 inches long and 3 inches wide. 
Sterilize these bags in boiling water and 
then dry them. : 


. HOW TO MIX. 


N purchasing pork for sausages, see to 


it that the butcher gives a good propor. 
tion of lean meat; too much fat means too 
much shrinkage in cooking and a more

“indigestible article of diet. Run the meat 


through a food chopper, using the medium- 
sized cutting knifé. Place in a large mix- 
ing bowl, add the salt and spices and mix 
thoroughly with a wooden spoon or, pre- 
ferably knead with the hands. Pack the 
mixture solidly into the bags, to within 
two inches of the top, tie them firmly and 
place in the ice box or in some cold space. 
When wanted for use, open and turn back 
the bag and slice off the ‘sausages in 
rounds. about 1 1-2 inches thick.

sausage may find the following combina- 
tion of beef and park to solve their diffi- 
culty.

When You Want to Travel and Can’t 


TS a common complaint—this 
| thirst for travel—and it comes 
>§ 2; upon you when you least sus- 

paar pect it. It may come to cast a 

y bit of a shadow on the first 

feuee st weeks of enjoyment of the new 

ie Si house, though usually it comes 
to torment you when you have been set. 
tled for six months or so. It may come 
just as you’ve paid off the first mortgage 
with two years still to go before the last 
is forever done with. It may come when 
you are a bride, and it may come when 
your children are quite young and you are 
practically tied down hand and feet to 
the spot you call home. 

Symptoms are not hard to recognize— 
a taste for books on travel, a rereading 
of the diaries you kept those years you 
did travel, a surreptitious sending to rail- 
road and steamship lines for folders and 
particulars of tours. Then at times comes 
a close calculating—if times are good and 
this bit of stock yields good dividends, 
and no one is sick and there are no doc- 
tor’s bills and your husband doesn’t yield 
to the temptation to buy a new car and 
Tommy in prep school doesn’t need tutor. 
ing to get through his examinations—this 
all needs elaborate figuring with columns 
of adding and subtracting—then this sum- 
mer or maybe next summer you might 
make that trip abroad or to the Canadian 


Rockies or picturesque Canada a possi-° 
bility. 


Often the whole thing is quite hope- 
less. True, if you bend your energies in 
that direction and save wisely with that 
end in view, you can probably some day, 
sometime, do your bit of traveling. But 
the time may be far off, 


M EANTIME to get yourself out of the 


grip of the thing, try this remedy: 
Change your home surroundings a little, 
Rearrange the furniture, try a new color 
scheme. Try the experiment of virtually 
moving out of your house and then moving 
in again. That is, arrange the things not 
as you happened to hit upon five years ago 
when you came in, but as you would find

- little saflor suits that the small © 


boys and girls so leve to wear, 
are, of course, like a train without an 
engine unless the proper emblems appear 
on the sleeve. Some of these young hope. 
fuls are most particular and just any vid 
emblem won't do at ali. Girls for the 
most part prefer to wear their. patriotism 
on their sleeves, eagle emblems being the 
favorites. These emblems provide the 
necessary bright spots for these dresses 
and the homemaker knows that when she 
embroiders it herself in colors, she can 
vouch against its fading. ‘These designs 
can be bought in sets containing about 15 
different designs. 


The most aristocratic of all the land of 


embroidery is the scallop. The very fine 
household linens are particularly fond of 
it in any form. ‘To the Hnens a scallop 
edge tends a distinction that Is the pride. 
and joy to every homemaker, for she can 
pad the scallop and work them herself and: 
when finished she knows that she has the

buy. She finishes her towels, her pillow- 
cases, her bed-spreads and most every. 
thing else in the linen- chest with a scal<

After the matter of the linens comes 
the problem of providing countless dainty 


things for the tiniest of persons. There 
are neck outlines that can be buttonholed 
and cut out to produce a most delicate 
effect. These show the round, square and 
even the new oval neck lines. 


HE homemaker who has beautiful 
linens is so very proud of them that 
she marks them with a monogram and 


that monogram must be the most distinc- 
tive one available. Whether it is a single 
initial or an interlaced monogram the 
same care is taken in selecting a grace- 
fully curved letter or letters that com- 
bine into a compact monogram. A new 
transfer pattern is out on the market 
and is made so that any monogram can 
be made by combining the letters. 

So many beautiful hosiery is so often 
spoiled by running stitchings caused by. 
the fasteners of our supporters. Take .a 
row of machine stitches, the color of the 
stocking, about one inch below the place 
where the fasteners hold the stockings, 
and you wil] have no more trouble, Be sure 
to stretch the top of stockings wide before 
stitching, so that it will not bind the knees. 
Many of the fine, expensive hose show a 
hemstitching just below the knee to pre- 
vent this running. 


O make a strong button hole in lace, 
baste a strip of lawn firmly under 

the lace, then cut the buttonhoele- and

cut away the lawn close to the stitches

In cutting away the goods beneath lace 


insertion in lingerie, one is very apt ta’ 


cut the lace itself. This can be obviated, 
however, if a narrow stiff piece of card- 
board, pointed at one end, is slipped be 
tween the lace and the goods. The card- 
board then acts as a safeguard when the 
scissors are used. 

A mother saved a piece of each wash 
suit her little son had until he was ten

white one was from a suit he had on when 
hig picture was. taken and so on. He 
never tired of the quilt, and would be en-

Can Make Soup 
. For Nothing 


HE objective of the ‘thrifty 
¢ \i housewife in making soup is to 
age ~=6lmake it for nothing. She ought 

-hti to aim to have soup once every 
day and almost always to have 
it without adding materially to 
her food budget.

meat. 
meat, drain off the liquid and set the 
meat aside to cool Then remove the 
bone, gristie and skin or fat and put the 
‘meat through the grinder. It is better 
always to grind it, as soup meat used 
for soup is sure to be rather tasteless 
and-the fine grinding makes it possibie 
for the seasonings and flavorg used in 
making it over to:penetrate throughout. 
This would not be possible were it simply 
picked apart into small pieces. Moreover, 
if the’meat is tough the grinding breaks 
up the tough fibers, making it to all in- 
tents and purposes quite tender. 


VERY little soup meat is enough to 

make into croqueties, because these 
are best when combined with cooked rice, 
farina or other cereal. They should be 
well seasoned. 'Tomate and onion flavor 
are well employed to give back the flavor 
robbed by prolonged cooking of soup 
eae TP * 

Casserole dishes of chopped soup meat 
are good. Here is a suggestion. Put a 
little fresh fat im the frying pan and 
when hot, but mot smoking, add one or 
two chopped onions. .Ceok the onions 
without letting them burn. Next turn 
in the chopped meat and mix and then 
add enough canned tomato to make a 


- gott mass. Turn this into a greased bak- 
ing dish, sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, 


dot sparingly with butter and bake. To 
reduce the cost in cooking, cook this in 
the fireless cooker between two radiators. 
If your soup meat has cost forty cents 


and you make use of the meat to take 
the place of fresh meat that would cost 
forty cents or more, then you can figure 
that the soup steck has cost nothing. 


Almost every sort of vegetable water 
can be. saved for soup stock. This megns 
fresh cooked vegetables, as the water 
drained from canned vegetables is not

She combined with them black and

she would apply cutouts and zickrack

: Little Things That Go to Make One An 


Ideal Saleswoman 


ONT refer to yourself as a “sales- . 


laiy.” Ne one talks about cay- 


alry-gentiemen, or artiliery-gen-- 


flemen or midship-gentiemen, 

and if your friend who has en- 

listed. did so refer to himself you 

wouldn't think any more of his 
. social position than of the man 
who was simply a cavalryman or artillery- 
man or midshipman. The fact is that the 
expression “sales-lady” to a great many 
persons sounds extremely cheap and the 
sooner you cut it frem your vocabelary 
the better. . ‘ 


phere is a certain look-ef disgust min- 


puts the next customer inte a reticent 
mood to begin with. And that, of course, 
bed salesmanship. So don’t pierce de- 
customers with that look even 


‘though they have been unreasonable and 


) amd that is the only way you 
of registering your feeltag fcr them. 


Don't. the firm you work for be- 


It is the act of supreme 


Don’t. hum. There Is a certain kind >»

the last one-step they danced the night be- 


fore, or the catch tune of the last musical — 


comedy they saw, and when they hum that 
way the customer always fe®is as if the 
hummer’s mind was on those pleasure 
passed rather than on the business of mak- 
ing a sale. The woman who makes a go

think if | were a head of department in a 
department store I would usually feel tuac 
there was little hope for good results from 
the humming saleswoman. f would rather 
have her whistle “Yankee Doodle” outright 
because she might at least de that and 
be interested in her work. 


HERE are a lot of don'ts that one 
might write for saleswomen, but they 


are things that they don’t do anyway. Don’t 


chew gum, don’t come to work with a 
beery breath, dén’t chew toothpicks, don’t 
call across the aisles to your friends at 


the other counter, don’t use strong per-

something interesting in combining a col-

You can duplicate these aprons your- 
self, using for their makimg sateen, chintx 
and cretonne or those charming, soft Eng-

manship counts a lot in giving them the 
Tight finish, and that a careful choice of 
combining colors counts 4 lot, too.
