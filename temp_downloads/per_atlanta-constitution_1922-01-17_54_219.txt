ment of Cannery, Feed 
Mill and Potato Curing 
House to Be Discussed. 


Decatur, Ga., January 16.—(Spe- 
cial.)—An important mass meeting of 
DeKalb county citizens, for the pur- 
pose of organizing and aesuring a de- 
parture from the one crop system this 
year, will be held in the courthouse 
here Tuesday night at 7:30 o'clock. 

After preliminary discussion, the 
chief subject of the evening will cen- 


ter around the establishment of a feed 
mill, cannery and potato-curing ware- 


house, all to be supplied with products 
through a co-operative system of mar- 


keting. An association, capitalized at 
| $50,000 at the start, will be one result | 


of the meeting, it wae asserted by 
leaders of the movement tonight.

vation of food and feed crops. The

posals, while brotherhood chiefs will 
report back to their organizations, 
and if the agreement is ratified, as 
all concerned expected today that it 
would be, the regional gatherings will 
be summoned on or about February 
10. 


The action was decided upon after! „ 


au all-day session in which active 
heads of many of the larger railroad 
organizations ef the country partici-

dent of the Pennsylvania; C. H.

ver said, would “facilitate the work

good will, and the settlement of dif- 
ferences by adjustment, not by meth- 
ods of litigation.” 

Fixing of Wages. 

It was pointed out that the fixing 
of wage scales for train em- 
ployees had been brought about 
through. negotiations participated in 
by railroad officials and union rep- 
resentatives in districts where work 


was performed during all the period 


"iis industry, truck farming and eulti- prior to the war. Further, it was 


said, that the method of reconciling 


i differences prior to appealing to the 


labor board had been specifically con- 
templated by the transportation act 
sections creating the board. 

Mr. Hoover stated that the confer- 


original measure, to which the admin- 
istration objected, stipulated definitely 
that this be done. 

During today’s debate, senators de- 
nounced and defended the many phases 
of the reserve boaru’s activities. Sen- 
ator Norris, republican, of Nebraska,

SURCHARGE RULING 


Interstate Commerce 
Commission Is Told 
That Georgia Railroad 
Board Is Discriminating. 


Railroads of Georgia have filed a 
complaint with the interstate com- 
merce commission .because of the re- 
cent action of the Georgia commission 
in removing the surcharge of 50 per 
cent on Pullman car fares and chair 
car fares, as applied to intrastate busi- 
ness, according to a notice received 

Monday by Chairman C. H. Candler, 
of the Georgia commission, and Gov- 
ernor Thomas W. Hardwick. It was 
announced by the interstate commis- 
sién that a date for a hearing in/ the 
case will be fixed later. 

In their complaint, 


the railroads 


claim that the state commission, in 


removing the surcharge, is diserimi- 
nating against interstate passengers in 
favor of intrastate passengers. The 
Georgia commission heard evidence in 
this case in November and issued an 
order December 15 removing the sur- 
charge, effective December 20. The 


order went into effect December 20. 
und since that date the railroads have 


not made the surcharge in intrastate

WAS TECH STUDENT 


C. E. Ard, 50 years old, general 
manager of he Bosworth-Ard foundry, 
„ Ala., who was found dead 
at the foundry office Sunday with two 
bullet holes in his temple, was an old 
Georgia Tech student. W. P. Wal-

Ard was at Tech from 1888 to 1802, 
when he graduated. 

Leaving Tech, he taught school at 
Columbus, Miss., and then became a 
contractor at Birmingham, Ala., from 
which city he went to Anniston. Ard 
was originally from Stewart county. 
and his many friends are touched by 
his death, which, according to the cor- 
oner’s verdict, was “death by his own 
hands.” The cause is unknown. The

resentative of the agricuitura! inter- 
ests on the board heretofore there 
would have been no deflation policy 
adopted by the board, which, he 
charged, has done much injury to the 
farmers of the country. 

Senator Harfis pointed out the 
failure of the republican party to 
puss a revenue bill which wauld dis- 
tribute the burden of taxation fairly 
instead of placing the full burden on 
the consuming public and permitting 
the banking interests of the east to 
be exempted. He said it was due to 
the work of the “agricultural bloc’, 
that a revenue bill finally was passed 
which placed a share of the tax bur- 
den on the big money interests, 


Wants Farmer on Board. 
In opening his speech, Senator Har- 


ris said: q 

Mr. President, I 8 favor the pas- 
sage of this measure, Which requires that 
one member of the Ls e board 
shall be an experienced 2 is a 
practical farmer engaged ii the occupation 
und not a theoreticai-agriculttrist. The law 
already requires that two members of this 
board shall be experienced bankers. The 
weath of thie cou principally 
walf the entire 
engaged in this 
y brought 
home to us in a way to make anyone un- 
derstand that. the pros , of our country 
depends upon the prosperity of the farmers. 
When they cannot sell

ucts, they have no money to buy from the 
manufact of.the east, -Every section 
of our try is dependent upon the other, 
and when we help another section we are 
helping our own, 


Declaring that agriculture re- 
ceives less from the government in 
proportion to what it gives than 
any other industry, Senator Harris 
declared he had no apology to offer 
for becoming a member of the “ag- 
ricultural bloc.“ He declared that 
the Federal Reserve banks were not 
created so that bankers could make 
money out of them. He said these 
banks were created to sezve all the 
interests of the country, including 
the agricultural interests. 

If there had been on this board during 
the past two years a representative of the 
agricultural interests of this country I do 
not think we would have had the deflation 
policy of the federal reserve board, which 
nas done such great injury to the farmers 
and business men of the south and west, 
and from which it will take years to re- 
cover. It has destroved hundreds of mil- 
lions in values of farm products, ; 
Senator Harris said he had of- 
fered two amendments to the meas- 
ure before the -géenate which he 
hoped wound be adopted. On is to 
require the consent of congress be- 
fore the federal reserve board or 
banks can construct bank bulld- 
ings and the other is to make the 
rate of discount the same for all 
the regional banks. 


Charges Unnecessary Expenses, 


Under the presen law Senator: 
Harris asserted that federal reserve 
board can construct buildings t 
any cost, declaring that no such . 
thority is vested in other govern- 
ment boards. He said the boatd 
has spent vast and unnecessary 
sums on buildings, wasting money 
while the discount rate was un- 
E high. He charged that 
in New York tie board spent as 
much money on a building for a few 
hundred operatives as was spent in 
building the capitol, state, war and 
navy buildings, the treasury bbild- 
ings and many other public build- 
ings in Washingtoh. He charged 
that this policy indirectly caused 
much loss to purchasers of Liberty 
1 and other government secur- 
tles. 
Patriotic men and women all over this 
country denied themselves and their fam- 
flies money in order to buy Liberty bonds 
to conduct the war successfully. The banks 
over the country, both large and small, 
urged their customers to buy ds and 
were glad to loan money with the bonds as 
cofiateral at a low rate of interest. The 
dividends om the bonds, amounted to almost 
as much as the interest the banks charged 
on. the note of the buyer of the bonds. 
There were numbers of e in. every ' 
munity who made great sacrifices in order 
to pay part on the ds, and borrowed 
90 per t of their valde from the banks 
with bonds “ag collateral. When the 
Federal Reserve banks raised the discount 
tes beyond all reason the banks had to 
raise their interest rates, which was 30 
much in excess of the dividends on bonds 
that a large number of the holders of the 
bonds had to sell them, and bonds went 
to 85 cents on the dollar. Persons of 
amall and moderate means were forced to 
sell, They lost $15 on each bond for which 
they bad paid $100. These bends were 
then purchased by the rich of the country 
at this low price, and within a few months 
the federal reserve board reduced the dis- 
count rate; interest on was reduced, 
and the value of bonds went up to about.

Mr. President, more than 4 year ago T 
introduced in the senate @ bill reducing the 
discount rate the Federal Reserve Santee 
to 5 per cent, It shonid never have been 
raised to 7 per cent. Also. I introduced 
a bill allowing twelve months’ time on 
agricultural paper discounted by banks in- 
stead of five months, as under the present 
law. Governor Harding, chairman of the 
federal reserve’ board, opposed both of these 
measures before the committees on bank- 
ing and currency, to which they were re- 
ferred. The republican members of the 
committees opposed the bills and defeated 
them. Had these bills passed, millions of 
people would have been benefited. and 
they could have held their bonds or sold

dividends when farmers and business | 
men were losing money and result- 
3 in an increase in freight rates. 
nator Harris pointed out that last 
year when farmers and business 
men were suffering because of ter- 
rible financial conditions and wnen 
the federal reserve board had fail 
to come to their relief an attempt 
was made by Senator Lodge, of 
Massachusetts, to adjourn congress. 
Senator Harris said it was repub- 
lican members of the “bloc” voting 
with democrats who prevented this 
adjournment, thus enabling con- 
gress to remain in session and pass 
the measures which brought relief 
so badly needed. 
By defea 
—— remained in sess 22 the 
‘orris bill, which placed a billion dollars 
held by the War Finance corporation at the 
disposal of the farmers, business men and 
bankers who wished loans on agricultural 
ucts and live stock at a low rate of 
nterest. Nearly every bank in the south 
and west was loaded down with such paper 
and they had no 11 to loan for the 
usual demands. But by discounting all such 
paper with the War Finance corporation 
they had money to accommodate other de- 
mands of legitimate business. Except for 
the passage of this law, and the agricul- 
tural bloc is responsible for it, in some 
agricultural states a large number of banks, 
business men, and farmers would have failed 
in business. 
By defeating the recess ef congress the 
agricultural bloc was able to pass the 
enyon-Kendrick bill regulating the five 
meat packers, the greatest food trust in 
the world, supplying foodstuffs to every 
household in America, and fixing the price 
oe hogs and cattle all over the United 
a 


Asked Investigation. 

After receiving complaints from 
farmers in Georgla that packers 
were paying 3 cents a pound less 
for hogs in Georgia than in other 
states, Seator Harris said he intro- 
duced a resolution in the senate dl- 
recting the federal trade commis- 
sion to investigate the matter. He 
said the commission investigated 
every phase of the packing industry 
and as a result of its recommenda- 
tlons laws were passed by con- 
gress protecting hog and cattle 
raisers and the public. He said 
these laws caused much better con- 
ditions to exist. He declared that 
the “bloc” should receive full cred- 
it for the passage of these laws and 
asserted that if it were not for the 
„bloc“ the federal trade commission 
wou be abolished and consumers. 
of the country would be at the 
mercy of the trusts. Senator Har- 
ris pointed out that the federal 
trade commission, at his personal 
request, had taken action last year 
which resulted in a reduction of 
the price on bagging and ties which 
were sold to farmers of the south. 
He pointed out how the commission 
also had recommended that the 
Standard Oil company be prevented 
from selling gasoline lower in one 
state than in another. He said 
he introduced a resolution in the

Senator Harris then declared that 
it was the republican. members or 
the bloc“ voting with the demo- 
crats who made it possible for le- 
islation to be passed providing for 
the completion of the Muscle Shoais 
development which, will mean 
cheaper fertilizers for the farmers 
of the country in time of peace and 
will. furnish cheap nitrates for the 
manufacture of munitions in times 
of war. 

Wanted Nitrate Sold at Cost. 

When the Muscle Shoals proposition was 
before the senate Y offered an amendment 
providing that nitrates made at the plant 
during peace times should be sold to the 
farmers at cost and that the farmers should 
be given the preference in purchasing it. 
In my state alone we have used in one year 
more than $50,000,000 of fertilizers. If this 
plant should be developed as proposed it 
would save the farmers of Georgia more 
than $10,000,000 a year on the cost of fer- 
tilizers, which is equal to the total an- 
nual expenses my state government in- 
eludl confederate pensions and common 


schools, : 

er the Muscle Shoals measure passed 
the senate ft was defeated in the house by 
a small majority. Unfortunately for the 
country, the republican leaders in the house 
made a partisan measure of it. A leading 
republican during the house debate told his 
republican colleagues that if Muscle Shoals 
jo = located — the —.— — would 

y any votes agains . 

Senator Harris said the “bloc” 
had aided in the passage of a reve- 
nue bill which taxed wealth as well 
as those who work. 

Tt is a fact no one will contradict that 
until President Witéon'’s administration all 
taxes to support the government were paid 
by the consumers of the country through 
Lo riff and other taxes, and the wealth 

the country, most able to pay, escaped 
taxation while receiving the greatest bene- 

our government. ng the 
world war the number of millionaires was 
more than doubled, and they hoped to és- 
cape taxation on their wealth when the 
republicans came into power. This would 
have been done had the republican members. 
of the agricultural bloc not joined with the 
democrats and defeated legislation planned 
by republican leaders, The ublicang suc- 
ceeded in repealing the tax imposed upon 
corporations making excess profits. though 
several republicans of the bloc voted with 
the democrats to defeat its repeal. 

While this revenue bill was before the 
senate I offered an amendment to the bill 
cutting in half the tax on the first few 
thousand dollars of income earned by those 
engaged in trades and professions, Every

Columbus, Ga., January 16.—(Spe- 
cial.)— Two Harris county bank cash- 
iers stood arraigned on the charge 
of embezzlement when the superior 
court of that county convened at Ham- 
ilton today, Judge George P. Munro, 
of Columbus, presiding...George Stan- 
ford, former eashier of the Bank of 
Waverly Hall, confessed to embezzling 
$16,000 of the funds of that insfitu- 
tion, and was sentenced to 12 months 
in the penitentiary. Friends of the 
young man have petitioned the court 
to give him the alternative of paying 
a fine, 

Milton Camp, former cashier of the 


bank at Shiloh, was charged with em- 


bezzlement of funds, but the case was 
continued, Judge Munro being disqual- 
ified on account of being related to 
one of the stockholders of the bank. 
The case was continued until Janu-

the defendant wished to make an

Fountain’s testimony to the effect that 
he had confessed to him. The judge

Both sides then announced that

which China would be assured a 5 per

May Rebuild Hotel 
| At I ndian Springs 


Macon, Ga, January  16—(Spe- 
cial.)}—The Wigwam hotel at indian 


Springs, 

to the days when it was reached by 
carriage and stage coach from For- 
syth, will not be rebuilt by the Ma- 
con capitalists who own it, it was 
learned today. The hotel was burned 
to the ground vn August 21 of last 


in Macon was leveled by fire. i 
Simultaneously it was learned that 
a syndicate of Atlanta men have in 
mind featuring the sulphur -water 
baths on the reservation and of re- 
building the hotel. 


Ed Jacobs, Freeman Hart and T. 
W. Hooks, of Macon, are owners 

‘a lease on the property that has 
twenty-three more years to run. They 
valued the hotel at $150,000, and the 
insurance was $40,000. They said 
that rebuilding in the face of this-foss 
is impossible. 

There are ten acres in the reserva- 
tion, which was leased by the state 
years ago under a 99-year lease. Be- 
sides that tract, the Macon men own 
twelve acres, which the Atlanta syn- 
dicate also is considering purchasing. 
Left standing after the fire were 
the Casino, the Eagle's Nest, a three- 
room cottage furnished, a double ga- 
rage, servants’ quarters, three water 
tanks, a pumping station and a two- 
story power house. There also is an 
annex of eighteen rooms. 


$10,000 IS SUBSCRIBED 
T0 OPERA GUARANTEE 


More than $10,000 was subscribed 
Monday to the guarantee fund of the 
Atlanta Music Festival association to 
insure the twelfth season of Metro- 
politan opera. The total has now 
reached 225, and it is only a ques- 
tion of a few days before the entire 
guarantee is assured.

The value of grapefruit and 
orahges, in calories or fuel units of

beauty is more than skin deep. The real merit of these 
citrus fruits is in the juice and-good looks do not signify 


juiciness.

be found just as juicy and sweet as fruits which are 


bright on the outside.

the system. 

It is the juice of grapefruit and 
oranges that contains the caloriesand 
the vitamines. Sealdsweet Florida 
fruits are heavy with juice, indicated 
by weight, hence their usefulness as 
food and for maintaining health. 


For Inner Goodness 


That Will Satisfy 


Sealdsweet grapefruit and oranges may be depended upon. This 
inner goodness is the first aim of the co-operating growers who market 
their fruit through the Florida Citrus Exchange. 

The same trees produce grapefruit and oranges that vary in outer 
appearance from bright and golden to russet, but are equally good 


inside. Buy for juiciness and sweetness rather than by color, using 
the Sealdsweet trade-mark as your guide.

. Although only two days have pass- 
‘ed since the Presbyterian campaign to 
raise $200,000 for the support of 
Christian education in the state began 
ita success already seems assured, W. 
D. Beatie, city-wide chaitman for At- 


lanta, and workers associated with 
him, announced last night at a ban- 
guet held in the North Avenue Prep- 
byterian church. 

One church in the city, the East 
Point church, has already gone over 
the top,” he announced, and four other 
churches, Inman Park, Druid Hills, 
College Park and North Avenue, will 
exceed their quotas before half the 
week expires, according to his predic- 
tions. 

The banquet was held for the work- 
ers in the campaign and more than 
one hundred leading Presbyterians of 
Atlanta attended. The chief talk of 
the evening was given by Miss Jonnye 
V. Thomason on the work of Chris- 
tian education being done at the Na- 
coochee institute. 

T of School Work. 

Miss Thomason, who is a girl from 

out of the Blue Ridge mountains, and 


a graduate of the mountain school, told 


of the sacrifices being made by tea- 
chers at Nacoochee and the work that 
they were doing. 

“Since Nacoochee started,” she said, 
“the teachers there have given in 
salaries to the institute $100,000, the 
sum asked for the school in this cam- 
paign. Many teachers today teach 
at the Nacoochee institute at great 
personal sacrifice and inconvenience 
to themselves. 

“They labor there throughout the 
year among the boys and girls from 
out of the Cumberlands and the Blue 
Ridge, teaching them the gospel of 
God and rendering a service to Christ 
that is inestimable. 

“Nacoochee has meant more to me 
than I can ever tell you, and it would 
mean as much to the hundreds of 
mountain boys and girls that are turn- 
ed from its doors yearly if they could 
only enter there. That is one of the 
purposes of this campaign, to expand 
Nacoochee, and all money expended 
on it is an investment in Christianity 
that will pay big dividends in His 
name throughout all time. 

“This is a wonderful opportunity 
for the Presbyterian church to make 
its influence felt all over the world 
hy turning out trained girls from over 
the hill to labor for Christ in all farts 
of the world. It eannot, it must not 


Predicts Growth. 

Dr. R. O. Flinn, pastor of the 
North Avenue Presbyterien church, 
spoke on the work of the North Ave- 
nue school, predicting its continua: 
growth. 

“The school,” he said, “is now owne, | 
hy the North Avenne chureh and if 
the Presbyterians of Georgia do not 
have vision enough to resnond to sy- 
nod’s call and raise $100.000 to make 
it a part of the synod, the North 
Avenue church will retain it and con- 
inue its expansion. It is up to the 
1 in Atlanta and al 
Georgia to decide whether the schoo! 
will become the property of synod, for 
its ownershin by synod depends on 
the snecess of this campaign.

ham in this city. . 

An official of the firm with which 
this business man is prominently con- 
nected, according to the letter, asked 
the writer of the letter to purchase a 
country ham for him. Thinking that 
this would be a favor easily done, the 
business u visited several commis- 
sion hou here and found that they 
had not a single country ham on hand. 

“In the search of a country ham,” 
said the letter, “I exhausted every 
means at command, and haven't found 
one yet in this whole city.” 

When The Constitution received the 
letter, it could hardly believe that 
farmers of Georgia, who have heen 
urged to raise hogs dnd do anything 
to get away from the one-crop cotten 
system, could possibly be missing the 
opportunity of marketing their hams 
in the city. : 

_A thorough canvass of the business 
district. including both wholesale. and 
retail concerns, proved, however, that 
the writer of the letter was correct in 
his every statement. 

Taking into consideration that 
Georgia farmers probably own more 
hogs today than ever before in the 
agricultural hstory of the state, the 
fact that not a single country ham, so 
far as could be ascertained, is on the 
Atlanta market, is particularly im- 
pressive. 

“I .talk to farmer-merchants every 
week.“ said the local business man in 
his letter, “and they tell me that they 
have to listen to ‘hard-luck’ and boll- 
weevil’ stories from their farmer-cus- 
tomers. Yet, you can’t find a real. 


eld, honest-to-goodness country ham in 


the whole city for sale.” 
And he might have added: Can 
you beat it?“

MISHEL PIASTRO 7 


WILL BE SOLOIST 
AT CONCERT HERE 


Mishel Piastro, a young violinist, 
who has proved a real sensation in 
musical circles since his arrival in 
America about a year ago, will be the 


soloist next week with the Cincinnati 
Symphony orchestra, it is announced 
by the Atlanta Music club and the 
Salter Musical bureau, which are co- 
operating in presenting the famous old 
organization. The concert, on Wed- 
nesday night of next week, will be con- 
ducted as for several years past, by 
Mugen Ysaye, the famous Belgian, who 
laid aside the violin bow for the baton 
uiter years of fame as a virtuoso. 
The visits of the Cincinnati Sym- 
phony orchestra to the Atianta Audi- 
torium have become a regular annual 
feature of-the Atlanta musical season, 
and each year’s audience has been 
larger and more appreciative than that 
of the season before. It is one of the 
cidest musical organizations in Amer- 
iea, having been founded 27 years 
ago, and it is worthy of comment that 
many of its musicians have been iden- 
tified with it for more than twenty 
years, ' 
The program for the concert has 
not yet been announged, but it will be 
distinetly different from those of for- 
mer visits, Mr. Ysaye desiring to give 
his audience something new on every 
possible occasion. Seats will go on 
sale Friday morning at the store of 
the Cable Piano company. Mail or- 
dere will be received by the Salter

Will Defend Name. 

Here’s the letter of Soldier Brett, 
who confesses with pride that he bears 
the nickname “Andy Gump,” and is 
ready to defend that name on the field 
of honor: 

Editor Constitution: After reading in your 
paper Friday, the 13th, that the Governor's 
Horse Guard and the Georgia navy are 
siding with the Widow in the love affair 
of Uncle Bim and the Widow Zander. 
we think it. fitting to announce that if 
Andy and Min need any military help what- 
soever, Uncle Sam's regular army will give 
that help. 

ye are organizing a special underground 
oon corp for the purpose of observing 
the widow’s actions, and reporting them 
to Andy and Min. We have authoritative 
dispatches stating that the Swisg navy will 
be ready for action at a mom 
in case of open hostilities on th ol 
the Georgla navy. 

If any one wants to know why 
thusiastic interest in Andy and Minp 
them that one of us is named Andy Gump. 
and. of course, we have to uphold the fam- 
ily name und traditions and incidentally 
to help hold the strings of the pocketbook 
closed against any foreign female invaders. 

Uncle Sam should know by now that the 
widow is just a twentieth century vamp, 
and after nothing but his money. He 
has given her two acres of flowers and a 
car load of candy, besides numerous jew- 
ela of fabulous value, and hasn't made any 
impression on her 80 far, therefore, we ae 
willing to fight to keep the mazuma in the 
family. Yours truly, D. L. BRETT

Final action on the leasing of the 
governor’s mansion property at Peach- 
tree and Cain will be taken 
by the governor’s mansion leasing 
commission ut a meeting to be held 
next Saturday, it was announced fol- 
lowing a meeting of the commission in | 
the office of the governor Monday 
when three bids were given considera- 
tion. The governor named a subeow- 
mittee, composed of the governor him- 
self as ex officio chairman, and Carl 
N. Guess, Decatur: T. J. Carling. 
Macon, and Attorney-General George 
M. Napier, to eonfer with the bidders 
concerning details of their bids and 
to get the bids in shape for final ac- 
tion by the commission Saturday. ; 

At the Saturday meeting one of 2 
bids will be accepted or all will be re- 
jected, and the whole matter of leas- 
ing the mansion property turned back 
to the legislature for further action. 
The bidders Monday were W. F. Wine- 
coff, J. R. Smith, representing a client

under his bid for the. ten-year period 
would be $1,500,000. 

In the bid of Mr. Smith an offer 
of a graduated scale of rentals averag- 
ing $25,000 a year was made, which 
would net the state approximately

Mr. Massell's bid was $25,000 a year 
for the first 25 years and $30,000 a 
year for the last 25 years, netting the 
state a total of $1,375,000 for the 50

figures at the Saturday meeting. He 
said any other bids by responsible 
people could be submitted tween

General Electric Co. 
Denies Violations 
Of the Federal Laws 


in view of the current reports of 
action by tiie Lockwood investigating 
committee in extending its inquiries sv 
as to include the subject of the cost 
of incandescent electric lamps, the 
General Electric company has address- 
ed letters respectively to Harry M. 
Daugherty, attorney-general of the 
United States, and to Charles N. New- 
ton, atterney-general of the state of 
New York signed by Charles W. Ap- 
pleton, as,counsel for the General 
Electric company, and the company 
has authorized the publication of said 
letter. The letter is made public here. 
by Arthur Giles, 
with offices in Atlanta, as follows: 

“To the Attorney-General of the 
United States, Washington, D. C.: The 
counsel for a legislative committee of 
the state of New York has directly 
or indirectly charged the General Elec- 
tric company with the following vio- 
lations of the federal law. First, that 
it has created and is mafntaining an 
unlawful monopoly in the manufacture 
and sale of. tungsten incandescent 
lamps. Second, that it extorts from 
the public every year large sums by 
unlawful sales methods in the market- 
ing of suck lamps. Third, that it jug- 
gles its accounts so that immense prof- 
its are concealed and thereby escapes 
paying federal income and excess prof- 
it taxes. Fourth, that it has violated 
a decree of the federal court in a pro- 
ceeding brought by the United States 
through its attorney-general. 

These charges the General Electric 
company denies. The tungsten incan- 
descent lamps which the company 
manufactures are covered by patents 
which have been sustained by the high- 
est federal courts, to which we could 
take them. The patents are based on 
inventions largely the result of experi- 
ment in the research laboratories of 
the company. The distribution of 
lamps by consignment to agents has 
been openly carried on for a period of 
ten years and has been the subject of 
investigation by the federal authori- 
ties. Federal taxes are paid in ac- 
cordance with examination of our 
books and accounts by the federa! ex- 
aminers of internal revenue. 

“Our counsel have advised that in 
all respects we have complied with the 
decree of the federal courts. Under 
the rules of the legislative ingestigat- 
ing committee the General Electric 
company is denied the right of cross- 
examining hostile witnesses and is pre- 
vented from presenting the facts and 
laws through counsel. If the chafges 
made are true, the General Electric 
company is a violater of the federa! 
law. and should be dealt with accord- 
ingly. If the, charges are not true. 
while the company has no legal re- 
dress, at least it should not be con- 
demned by the American people. In- 
asmuch as these charges come directly 
under your jurisdiction, we invite you 
to investigate them, and if you are 
in doubt as to the legality of any of 
our acts, to bring an appropriate pro- 
ceeding in a court where we may be 
heard in order that the matter may be 
determined. =

EASY VICTORY WON

W. C. Davis, and provided that 520. 
6000 of the proposed 542,000 be divert- 
ed for the erection of a market build 
ing on the part of the lot already ac- 
quired and the other 522,000 be re- 
turned to the treasury. : 

As the first effort of the opposition 
after the market question was sounded 
Councilman Couch moved to refer the 
meusure back to the finance commit- 
tee, with instructions that public hear- 
ings be held. a 

Offering strong objection to any 
such tactics of delay Councilman Ash- 
ley urged an immediate decision. 

“The people don’t want this mar- 
ket,” replied Mr. Couch. “Certainly 
the people in my ward don’t. I believe 
the greatest injury done the Woman's 
club was when council voted the mar- 
ket appropriation. The ink had hard- 
ly got dry on the measure before the 
club went down here and tried to 
name a postmaster at McDonough.” 

“It’s time you stopped your fili- 
bustering methods,” suddenly roared 
Councilman Bob Gordon, pounding his 
heavy fists. We've whipped you 
once, and what's the use making us 
whip you again!“ , 

Alderman Carpenter took a hand in 
the debate, and denied that the market 
foes were anything like whipped. He 
charged that the resolution had been 
steam-rolled through the council and 
the —— refused a chance to vote 
on the subject because its adherents 
were afraid of the people’s voice. 

Mr. Ashley took issue with him and 
countered with the accusation that the 
alderman was playing for time and 
time only, in order to kill the appro- 
priation. 

This brought from Mr. Couch an- 
other speech, in which he admitted 
that he had been playing for time in 
1921, but declared that he had a dif- 
ferent motive in the new council, and 
K really fighting for the people to be 

eard. 


Action of Charter Revision. 


The resolution to take Councilman 
Watkins’ charter out of the hands of 
the charter revision and ordinance 
committees was introduced by Coun- 
cilman J. R. Nutting. Mr. Watkins 
opposed it. 

“I am not sure the resolution just 
offered would do more than result in 
another charter that would meet the 
approval of that particular commit- 
tee,” he said, and moved that the pa- 
per be referred to the committees to 
which his charter plan had been re- 
ferred. His motion was voted down. 

Mayor Key will name all of the 
fourteen members of the special com- 
mittee. He made the announcement 
Monday that “no attorneys of the 
Georgia Railway and Power com- 
pany, would be appointed as a mem:

Council adopted a resolution creat- 
ing the department of street improve 
ment collector, with one officer in 
charge at a salary of $1,800 a year. 
He will collect all assessments for 
street improvements. Alderman Good- 
hart made an effort to have the salary 
figure raised to $2,400, but was de- 
feated. 

A public hearing, to take ptace on 
February 17, was authorized on the 

proposed zoing plan of the city plan- 
ning commission. 

Council adopted a resetution requir- 
ing all departments of the city in the 
matter of hiring heip in any capacity 
to give preference to those who are 
citizens and taxpagers of Atlanta. 
Georgia Tech's invitation to attend 
the flag-raising exercises at Tech flate 

Wednesday afternoon, was unanimous- 
ly accepted by the city fathers. 

Sledge Collier, investigator in the 
office of city tax assessor, was re- 
elected without opposition. The resig- 
nation of J. W. Mason as a member 
of the Carnegie library board was ten- 
dered and accepted.

A fast revolving steel plate charged with a part of 
diamond dust and oil is used to polish the facets on. 


The diamond is set in a lead ball held down by a

LECT CAL BOARD 


City council; Monday afternoon, 
adopted the adverse report of the elec- 
trical control board on a measure to 
repeal the ordinance requiring rigid 
examinations, bath technical, and prac- 


tical, to be passed by ‘electrical con- 
— before licenses are issued. 


eilman Sims and threshed out at a 
spicy public session held Monday 
morning. Charges that a combine of 
Atlanta's large electrical contractors 
is receiving aid from the city depart- 
ment of elictricity in a scheme to de- 
stroy competition and force small 
contractors out of business, were made 
at this meeting. 

In refuting the charges, City Elee- 
trician Turner stated that a repeal of 
‘the law would mean an increase in 
fire insurance rates, and would cause 
a general demoralization in the elec- 
trical business. He said that the 
charge is merely a renewal of an old 
fight made on his office by a number 
of contractors who are afraid to face 
the board of examiners. 

L. M. Long, a contractor, in an 
attack on the city electrician’s office, 
said that he had evidence that Mr. 
Turner is trying to “freeze out” the 
small contractors. Carroll McGaughey, 
chairman of the examining board, de- 
nied Mr. Long’s statement, and said 
that any charge of connivance is 
groundless, 


As counsel, for the Atlanta Electri- 
cal association, R. P. Jones, attorney, 


denied that a combine exists. A. NI. 


Schoen, engineer for the Southern Un- 
derwriters’ association, said that if 
the present law were repealed insur- 
ance rates would be raised.

Just seven years ago, the first bot-

ple of Atlanta. The public way at 
tirst inclined to be skeptical, They 
simply couldn’t believe the remarkabie 
powers claimed tor this new medicine, 
but within a few weeks so many local 
men and women whose integrity 
could not be questioned, told in such 
sincere, straightforward statements 
of the wonderful benefits they had re- 
ceived from its use that the truth of 
the claims mad. fer Tanlac eould no 
longer be doubted. 

People all over Georgia began tak- 
ing Tanlac and tesiifying to its powers 
as a reconstructive tonie and body- 
bullder. It soon became a household 
word in every city. town ahd village in 
the state. This tremendous popularity 
increased from vear to year as new 
tests of its powers were made until 
now the sales Lave reached in Georgia 
alone the enormous total of 763,552

is today more universally recognized

Out the Head, Nose and

There is no disease more offensive 
or disagreeable, or no disease that will 
lead to as much serious trouble as ca- 
tärrh. Lou can now get rid of it by a 
simple, safe, pleasant home remedy dis- 
covered by Dr. Blosser, a catarrh spe- 
cialist.

According to W. O. Foote, president 

of the chamber, it is planned to send 
the pamphlets broadcast over the 
country to set forth the opportunities 
within the state in mining, agricul- 
tural and industrial lines. 
“My idea would be to work from 
within,” stated Mr. Foote. “We 
have competent men ‘here who can 
do the work for us and we are anxious 
to have those men—chemists, scien- 
tists, geologists and .the like work up 
a series of pamphlets showing just 
what Georgia has to offer. 

“Of the 72 elements used in indus- 
trial wares. 58 are to be found in 
Georgia. If we can show that con-

show that the minerals are here, thdt 
the banks want the new industries, 
and that the people have a welcome

The Atlanta chapter of the Ameri- 
can Institute of Banking will hold 
the second of a series of monthly 
forum meetings at 6 o'clock Tuesday 
evening at the Peacock cafe. 


J. C. Rose, collector of internal 
revenue, will make a talk upon “The

medicine bave been sold since its in- 
troduction seven years ago and today 
Taniac stands in we very first rank

BY W. L. GEORGE. 


New York, January 16.—An Eng- 
iishinan feels rather strange in a coun- 
try such as America, where so many 
women seem to have careers. I do 
not mean that in England we find no 
women in offices, that we lack women 
doctors, or ofhcicls. But we are not 


accustomed to seeing woman so much 


on her own;” we are surprised, not 
so much by her capacity, (of which 
I, for one, am well aware) as by the 
rewards that her capacity obtains. 
For England, and the rest of Europe, 
fails to afford woman a square deal; 
she has a better chance in England 
than in France, Italy, or any Latin 
country, but even it is a chance that 
the American girl would laugh at as 
she emerges from Vassar or Smith. 

When I consider the American busi- 


ness woman, I feel doubts, doubts be- 


ing a feature of my unfortunate men- 
tal equipment. I discover here and 
there a female district attorney, mag- 
istrate, or even assistant attorney- 
general: I observe with admiration a 
few women bankers, a firm of female 
real estate agents, women editors paid 
$10,000 a year—and yet I ask my- 
self: Has the American business 
woman gone as far as she thinks? 
Certainly she has gone further than 
any woman in the world has ever as- 
pired. The American woman has cut 
along which European 
women will drive their plows, but 
there are still many worlds for her 
to conquer. 

If you took through the business 
direcrory of any city, one does find a 
few female names among the lists of 
vice presidents—but how few! What 
a crowd ot masculine names surround 
tne Ionelv peaks that women have 
scaled! And where is the female pres- 
ident? The female secretary of state?

Cloth of 8 
For Wedding Gown 


Of Princess Mary 


London, January 16.—Princess 
Mary’s wedding gown is to be of cloth 
of silver, of magnificent design. The 


material was brought by the queen 
from India some years ago and is de- 
scribed as a triumph of native manu- 
facture. The dress will have a train 
of ivory silk, shot with silver, which 
is being woven by hand workers at 
Braintree, Essex, an old English silk 
manufacturing center, where the art of 
silk weaving has been passed down 
from generation to generation. So 
great is the care taken in the manu- 
facture of this material that only a 
few inches are finished each day. 

The train is expected to be ready 
soon, and it will then be placed in the 
hands of the embroiderers. 

Many schemes for presenting wed- 
ding gifts to the king’s daughter are 
afoot. The lord mayor of London is 
opening a popular fund for the pur- 
pose, with contributions limited to one 
pound sterling. 

Rumor has it that Viscount Ims- 
“elles and his royal bride may spend 
part of their honeymoon at the beau- 
tiful Villa Medici. at Fiesole, near 
Florence, Italy. The villa belongs to 
a cousin of the bridegroom, Lady 
Sibyl Scott, whose first husband was 
the late Bayard Cutting. at one time

bassy in London.

Kentucky Lady Tells How 


She Became Strong and 
Healthy — Recommends 
Cardui to Weak Women. 


Mount Vernon, Kx.— Mrs. Cynthia 
Vanhook. formerly of Stanford, but 
now residing here, says that after her 
third child was born, she undertook to 
resume lier housework too soon, “and 
this caused me a great deal of 
trouble.” 

“I began to feel weak and all play- 
ed out—not myself at all,” as Mrs, 
Vanhook describes her condition. “For 
about six weeks I was just a nervous 
wreck. I had to have some one do all 
my housework, 

“My doctor told me my imprudence 
had caused shock to the nervous sys- 
tem, and the thing to de was te use 
a tonic to build up my strength, 

“He recommended Cardui... Very 
soon I saw an improvement in my 
condition. I used three bottles of 
Cardui and. . . my health was re- 
stored. 

Jam a strong, healthy woman.“ 

This Kentucky lady adds that she 
“never fails to recommend Cardui to 
weak and run-down lady friends.“ 

Thousands of women praise Cardui 
to their friends. 

This mild, harmless, vegetable tonic 
medicine has been in successful use 
for over forty years, in the treatment 
of many common ailments suffered by 
women. 

Your druggist sells Cardui. 

Let him supply you, today.—(adv.)

perfectly sure it was a man, and in-

thought it extraordinary that the laay

and amazement at having it suggest-

“Stuck-ups Grand Ball.” “Wear the 
dress you have on and you'll be by 
far the most bright and particular 
star on the Stuck-up’s horizon,” or 
that she should scorn “her brown

To be sure, most of us—even of the

might find something wearable in that

ACTRESS TELLS SECRET 


Tells How to Darken Gray Hair With 
a Home-Made Mixture. 


Joicey Williams, the well-known 
American actress, recently made the 
following statement about gray hair 
and how to darken it, with a home- 
made mixture: 

“Anyone can prepare a simple mix- 
ture at home that will gradually 
darken gray, streaked or faded hair, 
and make it soft and glossy. To a 
half-pint of water add 1 ounce of bay 
rum, a small box of Barbo Compound 
and 1-4 ounce of glycerine. 

These ingredients can be bought at 
any drug store at very little cost. Ap- 
ply to the hair twice a week until the 
desired shade is obtained. This will 
make a gray-haired person look twenty 
years younger. It does not color the 
scalp, is not sticky or greasy and does 
not rub off.“ —(adv.)

Today’s Short Story 
BY GEORGE T, BYE 
Illustrated by Arlene Coyle 


It was one of the regulations of this 


Elks’ clubhouse that women guests 
were welcome to the second floor din- 


ing room but that none might go be- 


yond. At the second floor landing 
there was no lettered commandment: 
“Thou shalt not take females to the 
upper floors of this building.” Gen- 
tlemen are gentlemen, and as the upper 
floors of the clubhouse were. given 
over to bedrooms it was tacitly un- 
derstood, without instruction, that 
women should not be taken there, 

This accounts for the great uneasi- 

ness that went through the bedroom 
floors one night, about midnight, when 
a woman was heard to cry out: “Oh, 
you frightened: me so!” She was 
promptly hushed, and by the time 
doors were slowly opened and anxious 
eyes peered out, nothing was to be 
seen in the halls. Nothing lingered 
behind but a delicately persistent per- 
fume. 
One by one lights were switched 
on in rooms. One by one windows 
that had been raised for the night were 
audibly lowered. There was a stir 
in all rooms; and soon, one by ane, 
members, fully dressed, sauntered out 
in the hall, 
sniffed, and then descended the wide 
stairway to the first floor. 

The first floor of the clubhouse has 
an office in front and a rathskeller in 
the rear. Each member, as soon as he 
had carelessly descended the stairs, 
walked over to the mail box and de- 
posited a letter. An innocent bystand- 
er would have bet that a formal cere- 
mony was taking place, so closely imi- 
tative was each man of the preceeding 
one. 

The depositing of the Ietter was not

leaned on the steward’s 
desky yawned, drummed on the desk 
and remarked: “Well, got that off my 
mind. Just wrote a short letter to 
the wife.” Then one by one they 
drifted into the red-tiled rathskeller, 
looked around a bit, sniffed some 
more, and-walked over to Jack Lang- 
ley who was sitting in the center of 
the room, at first alone but now with 
a quickly growing crowd around him. 

A broad grin illuminated the face 
of Langley, who called himself “the 
collar ambassador” because he was a 
traveling salesman for a collar firm. 

„What's the big joke, Jack?“ they 
asked him, winking. 

The collar salesman winked back: 
“Stick around and you'll see.“ 

Presently Pat Lenahan, the steward, 
closely followed the last man into the 
rathskeller. Walking straight up to 
the collar ambassador Lenahan said 
“I’ve got to give it to you. You 
win.“ 

Langley jumped to his feet, then he 
jumped up on a rathskeller chair, Oh. 
vou easy marks!” he shouted. “FWery 
one of you owes me a dinner. JF was 
talking to Pat about the excitement

after you all had turned in. I bet 
him $10 that half of you would come

an excuse. With danger near, you all 
naturally would think of friend wife 
first thing. I went upstairs and spilled 
perfume down the halls, then I called 
out in my best treble voice that I was 
frightened. And then every man of 
you—not half, but all of you—got up 
and dressed, wrote the letter to the 
missus, and came down to mail it. 
Oh, it was rich! The best thing that 
ever happened!“

Who’s Who in the Story. 
Jeanne Dare, known in the little 
Iowz town whence she came as plain 
Jane Dare, has set herself up in New 


York es a wealthy woman in the hope 
of snaring a rich husband. In this 
effort she is making use of an 

Richard Canby, well-known man- 
about-town. Carby invites Jeanne 
to a dinner togetker with 


Mrs. Adele Parkinson, a widow and 
former flame of his. At dinner she 
meets 


millions, who shows signs of infatua- 
tion with her. 

Signor Bonnicetti, a famous violin- 
ist, asks only to serve Jeanne, and 
she uses him as a drawing card to 
her tea party. 

Adele foils Victor Barstowe's at- 
tempt to linger for a tete-a-tete with 
Jeanne. 

As Jeanne is starting for a dinner 
engagement, Henry Harrison 
phones. 

He informs Jeanne that he can bor- 
row nothing on her worthless land. 

Selby North, gossiping, elderly 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barstowe's 
many flirtations. 

Harrison comes to breakfast to ar- 
range for the transfer of property, 
and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents him as a-business ac- 
quaintance. 

Canby offers a market tip” 
means for Jeanne to make 
money. 

She arranges the party so that 
she drives to the Forbes' in Bar- 
stowe's car and Jeanne goes ahead 
with a man named Farnham.

stowes, to whom Vic presénts her as 
his fiancee.

Difficulties. 

The smile with which Barstowe’s 
mother welcomed her prospective 
daughter-in-law was one of pure con- 
ventional . politeness. It was mere- 
ly a matter of stretched facial mus- 
cles. There was no warmth behind it, 
nor in the eyes, gray like her son’s, 
but incredibly cold. . 

This is something of a surprise, 
Miss Dare,” she said — „Am 
glad, you could come to my little din- 
ner.’ 

She turned 83 over to her hus- 
band, as though by the reference to 
her dinner party, she had given the 
stump of triviality to her son’s an- 
nouncement of his engagement. Her 
attitude, the haughtily raised brows, 
seemed to say: “What ridiculous 
thing is this? Let us give it no more 
emphasis than it deserves, and pass 
on to the more serious problem of 
dining!“ 

Barstowe, Sr., took Jeanne's hand 
and murmured something convention- 
al. But his sharp eyes searched her 
face as if he looked for something, 
confident that he would find it. 

Jeanne did not flinch from the scru- 
tiny. She knew that he would only 
see a pretty face with unmistakable 
marks of breeding, whose fresh radi- 
ance was unenhanced by cosmetics. 

She had no fear of Barstowe, Sr. 
She had perfected her role to deceive 
men. But she did fear her fiance's 
mother. It was not easy to fool wom- 
en, especially women with such cold, 
keen gray eyes.

the rest of our guests, Ralph,” sug- 
gested Mrs. Barstowe to her husband. 
“You know Miss Dayton?” 

She turned to Vera Dayton, who 
was standing nearest, and made the 
presentation in an even voice. 

“Jeanne’s heart sank. She knew 
that it was to be war between Bar- 
stowe's family and herself. She 
thought she had won. Instead, the 
fight had only just begun. 

„ know Miss Dayton,” she replied 
in answer ta the other girl’s amazed 
cry. 

“How astonishing to find you 
here!” exclaimed Vera. Why didn’t 
you say something about it when I 
mentioned Mrs. Barstowe’s dinner?” 

“T did.“ Jeanne fibbed calmly, “but 
the connection was very poor. I 
dare say you didn’t hear me. I only 
caught half of what you said. Com- 
ing out in the car, I mentioned how 
rage fig. it would be if you didn’t know, 
to 

“Vic? echoed Vera sharyly, but 
Mr. Barstowe was already drawing 
Jeanne away to present the rest of 
the guests. 

Jeanne caught the quick, question- 
ing look which Vera shot at her host- 
ess, and she also saw the slight neg- 
ative headshake with which Mrs. 
Barstowe replied. 

It was evident to her that the Bar- 
stowes were not going to confide the 
news of their son’s engagement even 
to their most intimate friends. That 
was ominous. It, signified that they 
would do what they could to break it. 

Mechanically she acknowledged the 
introductions to the other members of 
the dinner company, all of whom were 
strangers to her. She was glad when 
dinner was announced. but surprised 
when Barstowe. Sr., offered his arm. 

Was it possible that they were re- 
lenting to the extent of making her 
the honored guest? 

At the table she noted the reason for 
this unexpected attention. Victor 
had been assigned to escort Vera Day- 
ton, and he was seated far down the 
table—quite out of conversational 
range from Jeanne. Across the orchid 
centerpiece he flashed her a reassur- 
ing glance, and she returned with 
her grave-eyed ‘smile. Even Mrs. 
Barstowe, watching covertly while she

Jeanne deliberately set out to win 
the approval of Barstowe, Sr. She 
had felt an undccustomed shyness at 


the prospect of eight courses or more 


of conversation with this well-known 
multi-millionaire. Especially with so 
much at stake on the impression she 
created! But in a few minutes she 
was forced to admit that he seemed 
no different from other men whom 
she met at Canby’s dinner parties, and 
after ten minutes’ groping for a sub- 


ject which was his hobby, she found 


it, and insisted upon his gaily riding 
it during the remainder of the meal. 
Ralph Barstowe was entranced. His 
hobby was collecting rare prints. He 
had discussed it with few women, 


+ They looked bored at the very men- 


tion of it, and yet here was a young 
and beautiful creature fairly hanging 
on his slow, ponderous words! ‘There 
was no suggestion of guile either 
about her eyes» They were wide with 
wonder, and reflected in their limpid 
depths a glorified picture of himself. 
She seemed honestly interested, and 
he immediately offered to show her 
his most precious collection in his pri- 
vate study directly after dinner. 

If he had known the truth, Jeanne 
could not have told whether his bob 
by was old prints or comic supple- 
ments, ‘She seemed to be paying him 
exclusive attention; yet she was aware 
of everything that was happening at 
the other end of the table. Not a 
gesture, a flash of the eyes, that pass- 
ed between Mrs. Barstowe and Vera 
Dayton, of the girl and Victor, es- 
caped Jeanne's notice. 

When the dinner was completed and 
the feminine guests had accompanied 
the hostess to the library for coffee, 
leaving the men behind, Vera Dayton 
seated herself beside Jeanne. 


“I’m going to tease you a bit about 
Vie. You won't mind, will you?’ she 
asked with charming friendliness. 

“Not in the least,” smiled Jeanne, 
waving away the servants who prof- 
fered creain and sugar for her coffee. 

“Of course every new girl gets u 
crush on Vic!” laughed Vera. He's 
to blame because he does flirt so 
abominably! I’ve tried to break him 
of the habit, but he won't listen to 
me. I don’t think it’s fair for him to 
trifle with feminine hearts the way 
he does, do you? 

Jeanne shrugged as she sipped her 
coffee. 

“Oh, it’s probably just as fair as 
the way they trifle with his! No- 
body plays the game ot flirtation 
squarely !” 

“But girls don’t flirt with Vic.” pro- 
tested Vera “They get serious!” 

“You mustn’t judge all women by 
yourself, Miss Dayton,” murmured 
Jeanne gently. 

Oh!“ 

The other girl drew back flushing. 
An angry light sprang iuto her eyes. 
Then she changed her mind and 
laughed. 

“You like to chaff me, don't vou?“ 
she remarked evenly. “Vie and I 
are quite used to being accused of 
falling in love with each other. Asa 
matter of fact, we reached a perfect 
mutual understanding about that long 
ago, though nobody suspects it.” 

Really?“ Jeanne smiled over the 
rim of her coffee cup, as if she were 
enjoying some delightfully humorous 
secret. 

Vera was nettled. She was about to 
say something more when Victor 
Barstowe came in with the other men. 

As soon as he spied Jeanne, he 
made for her corner instantly. 


Vera, misinterpreting his direction, 


had started to smile triumphantly, and 
her eyes turned to Jeanne as though 
to say:“ There! What did I tell 
von?“ i 

But Barstowe paused beside Jeanne’s 
chair and Went over her, his hands 
unconsciously brushing her shoulders 
with a possesssive air. 

“Having a pleasant evening, darl- 
ing?” he asked.

Universal etiquette prescribes that 
no one shall interrupt a speaker in 
the middle of a sentence. Yet in- 
terruptions of this sort are the com- 
mouest breaches of good manners. 
Self-control is a valuable social acqui- 
sition. It prevents anger or curiosity 
or impatience from breaking into an- 
ather’s speech and blocking the 
course of his thoughts. Indeed. one 
of the surest signs of that perfect 
, courtesy which is the flower of con- 
? sideration is the admirable patience 
with which a well-bred man or woman 
will listen to even a tiresome speech 
until such a moment as it can be defi- 
nitely answered or sidetracked with- 
out the effect of interruption. 

People who have not had the advan- 
tage of early training in good man- 
ners can easily acquire the most im- 
portant principles of social etiquette

alent, which is “Do not act toward

The Children's 
Hour 


Here is a ball game that little Tim 
will like. And it doesn’t make any 
noise! Tim's brother or sister will 
be glad to make it: 

Take a piece of cardboard, at least 
twenty-six inches long and eight inch- 
es high. Measure three inches from 
the left-hand side, on the bottom 
edge. Use this point for the center. 
Draw a semi-circle four inches in 
diameter. From the center of this 
semi-circle, on the bottom edge, make 
a dot five inches away. Use it as the 
center of another semi-circle four 
inches in diameter. Continue to do 
this till you have five semi-circles 
made. Cut them out. Over the spaces 
print the numbers 10, 25, 15, 50 and 
5. Cut a piece of cardboard eight 
inches square. Divide into two trian- 
gles. With pieces of tape eight inches 
long paste these to the ends of the 
bridge. Put the tapes at the back. 
The triangles will allow the bridge 
to stand. When it is not being used

REFUSE RESIGNATION 
OF DR. D. M. M’IVER 


The resignation of Dr. D. M. Me- 


Iver, pastor of the Druid Hills Pres- 


byterian church, was refused at one 
of the largest congregational meet- 
ings ever held by the church, follow- 
ing the morning service Sunday. 

‘The assembly declined the resigna- 
tion by a unanimous vote, and ap- 
pointed a committee to go before the 
Atlanta presbytery at its next regu- 
lar meeting, January 30, where Dr, 
Melver's resignation will be consid- 
ered, and present the views of his 
congregation. Dr. Melver's . resigna- 
tion, in favor of a large Presbyterian 
church at Bishopville, S8. C., had been 
announced one week ago. 

A number of talks by members 
were made at the congregational 
meeting. It was stated that the con- 
gregation had grown from one of 75. 
members to one of about 500, with a 
Sunday school of from 400 to 500 
members, and a number of young peo- 
ple’s societies.

When the dressmakers declared 
their war on black they evidently felt 
it could not be done wisely and well 
unless they substituted something vio-

trick of ‘substituting one worry for 
another. Human beings rather like 
their old worries and pains, for they 
know how to adjust themselves to 
them through the mental gymnastics 
experience has taught, but the scien- 
tists are all for changing one form 
of thought into another whenever 
there is the slightest suggestion of 
trouble in one or the other. It may 
— progress, but one doubts that it is 
improvement. 


If they are acting on this principle, 
they have taken a violent way of 
carrying it out. They have stopped 
trying to supplant black with gray

can event which stands by itself in 
me | this season’s musical calendar of At- 
in- lanta is the coming of Nellie and Sara 
fa ' Kouns, for a recital on Saturday aft- 
ernoon, January 21, at Egleston hall, 
under the auspices of the Music club, 
as one of the series intime. They 
will also give a “popular” concert 
Friday morning. 
These two young women, both so- 


pranos, had rather an unusual begin- 
ning of their career. They were born 
in Topeka, Kan., and are daughters 
«of the late Charles W. Kouns, tormer 
general manager of the Santa Fe rail- 
road. After prelinmary study with 
American teachers, they went to Ger - 
many to complete their musical educa- 
tion. However, such a thing as a 
professional career was far removed 
from their father’s plans for them, 
and when they were offered an en- 
gagement at the Royal Opera, Mu- 
- » pich, he not only withheld his permis- 
Sion, but to make sure that they would 
„ . wot launch forth into opera, went to 
“HK urope and escorted them home during 
the early days of the war. 

By this time the exquisite quality 
of their voices was so marked that, 
before long. Mr. Kouns was prevailed 
upon to consent to their appearing in 
concert, and the debut took place in 
Chicago, in a recital of duets and so- 
los. Possessing soprano voices of ex- 
ceptional beauty and purity, each 
with an individual charm of its own, 
und yet blending in the duets in a 
iashion which captivated all listeners, 
they offered something new and origi- 
nal and their vogue was immediate 
and pronounced. 


At once the most attractive offers 
were made then for light opera pro- 
ductions, but parental influence re- 
stricted them to the concert field. 
They were heard as soloists with the 
leading orchestral and choral organiza- 
tions in the middle west and on the 
occasion of their introduction to the 
New York public, duplicated their 
western triumphs. Engagements in 
‘he principal cities followed, and they 
were heard repeatedly in New York, 
Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Wash- 
ington, Milwaukee, St. Louis, San 
Francisco and Los Angeles. 

: At the height of their success, they 
gave it all up to go to France under 

: 


— — 


the auspices of the I. M. C. A. as en - 
tertainers of the American doughboys“ 

A professional season in England fol- 
on lowed, and a second tour of Great 
ful Britain and France in 1920, enhanced 
D, their wide popularity and added te 
Ng their legion of admirers. 

3 Their return to America in the 
kpring of 1921 was folllowed by a New 
York recital in Town hall, which was 
one of the outstanding successes of 
the entire season. 

A typical tribute is from The New 
York Sun, as follows: 


“The extraordinary degree of co- 
ordination that these two sopranos 
have developed in dynamics and color 
is heightened, if posible, by the sim- 
ilarity of their tone and range. Their 
duets are the real achievement of the. 
Misses Kouns. Alternating as to the 
choice of parts, they convey~a sense 
of perfect unity. Their ‘Sull Aria’ 
from Le Nozze di Figaro’ was utterly 
charming, their Strauss and Delibes 
were easy, graceful and modulated 
with great taste. An ensemble so per- 


a

half should be complete without the 
other.”

“You're crowding me more and more

It's no more than fair.“ said Day. 
“You've had the best of it for some 
time now. It's my turn to stick 
around longer.” 

“People would rather have me, any- 
way.” said Night. “I bring them 
rest.” 

“Not such thing.“ declared Day. “I 
bring them a longer time to stay out-

It won't be long now until I shall stay

good sport about it now.” 

“Well.” said Night. after a pause. 
“maybe you’sge right. It is your turn 
to stay on earth a little longer. But 
don't cut my time down so much at 
first. Make it gradual and then it will 
be easier for me to get used to it.”

s Weekly Novel 


(Continued from Yesterday.) 
CHAPTER XVII. 
By noon Nash reached the Drew 


3 to the eyes, a three. days’ growth of 
ys oe whiskers blackening his face, and that 
/*s face gaunt with the long, hard riding. 
~~ + “The devil and all hell plays on the 

ide of Bard,” began the foreman. “I 


= foot. He got away.” 
Got away?’ 
Shot the rope in two.” 
> ~ ~The other placed a book-mark, closed 
be volume, and looked up with the ut- 
most serenity. : 
= “How far is he away?” 
Two or three miles—maybe half a 
, dozen—I don't know. He'll be here 


before night.” 


The big man changed color and grip- 


bved the edge of the desk. Nasn had 


| + wever dreamed that it would be bes- 


idle to so stir him. 


“Coming here? 
„Nes. 

“Does he know me?’ 
“Just your name.” 


“Did he ask many questions about 
mer: 
ie wy eee to know what you looked 

ike.” 

And you told him?’ 

A lot of things. Said you were big 
‘eud gray. And 4 told him that story 
about you and John Bard.“ 

Drew slumped into a chair and 
‘ground the knuckles of his right hand 
across his forehead. The white marks 
remained as he looked up again 

“The boys wiil be here within—an 
nour—two hours. We've got work to 
d before thar time.” 

“Listen to me, answered the fore- 
man, “don’t let him get inside this 
huuse, l'd rather take part of hell 
into a house of mine. Besides, if he 

. Sees me—” 

He's coming here but he’s not go- 
ing to see either of us—my mind is 
‘nade up—neither of us until I have 
Lim helpless.” 

Dead, you mean,“ broke in Nash, 
“because otherwise he'll never be 
helpless.” 

» “J tell you, Nash,” said the other 
-colemply, “I can make him helpless 
with one minute of talk. My problem 
is to keep that wild devil harmless 
while he listens to me talk. Now 
listen. I think one of the boys looks a 
little like me. Lawlor—isn’t that his 

name?“ 

Him? Yes; a little bit like you— 
but he's got his thickness through the 
stomach and not through the chest.” 

“Never mind. He's big, and he’s 
gray. Send for him, and get the rest 
yf the boys in here. They're around 
ow for noon. Get every one. Under- 

Sand? And make it fast.“ 
In ten minutes they came to the

ed to stay, and if he stayed he must 
be fed and entertained, ‘Lhe difficul- 
ty in the way of this was that tue ser- 
vants in the big ranchhouse were two 
Chinese boys. They could never be 
trusted to help in the deceptin, so 
Drew summoned two of his men, 
“Shorty” Kilrain and “Calamity” 

n. 
Shorty Kilrain received his early 
education at sea and learned there a 
general handiness which stood bim in 
stead when he came to the mountain 
desert. There was nothing which 
Shorty could not do with his hands, 
from making a knot to throwing a 
knife and he was equally ready to 
oblige with either accomplisi.ment. 
Drew proposed that he take charge of 
the kitchen with Calamity Ben as an 
assistant. 

This arrangement completed the 
setting of the stage for the plav that 
was intended to be a comedy. 


CHAPTER XVIII. 
“The Critique of Pure Reason.“ 
But with the stage set and the cur- 
tain ready to rise on the farce, the au- 
dience did not arrive until the shadow 


of the evening blotted the windows of 
the office where big Lawlor waited 
impatiently rehearsing his part: but 
when the lamp had been lighted, as 
though that were a signal for which 
the tenderfoot had waited, the door 
of the room was jerked open and the 
sullen face of Nash, enlivened now by 
a peculiarly unpleasant smile, was im- 
Sserted. 

“He’s here!” 

As the door closed the grim realiza- 
tion came to Lawlor that he could not 
face the tenderfoot—his staring eyes 
and his pallor would betray him even 
if the jerking of nis hands did not. He 
swung abogt in the comfortable chair, 
seized a book and whisking it open 
bowed his head to read. All that he 
saw was a dance of irregular black 
lines; voices sounded through the hall 
cutside, 

Again the door yawned and closed. 
He could not see, for his back was 
resolutely toward it and he was grip- 
ping the cover of the book hard to 
steady his hands. 

Drew!“ said a low voice. 

The cowpuncher turned in his chair, 
What he saw was a slender fellow. 
who stood with his head somewhat 
lowered while nis eyes peered down 
from under contracted brows as 
though the light were hurting them. 
His feet were braced apart and his 
Lands dropped iightly on his hips— 
the very picture of a man reedy to 
spring into action. 

Under the great brush of his mus- 
tache, Lawlor set his teeth, but he was 
instantly at ease; for if the sight of 
the stranger shook him to the very 
éenter, the other was even more obvi- 
ously shocked by what he saw. The 
hands dropped limp from his hips and 
dangled idly at his side; his body 


straightened almost with a jerk, as 
though he had been struck violently, 
and now, instead of that searching 
look, he was blinking down at his host. 
Lawlor rose und extended a broad 
hand and an even broader smile.

We was ridin’ day and night an wear-

time. Then we got jest a hint from a 
bartender that maybe the Plottos was 
nearby in that section. 

“It didn’t need no more than a hint 
for us to get busy on the trail. And 
along about evenin’ of the second day 
we come to the house of Tom Shaw, a 
squatter. 


“Well, we rode up on the blind side 
of the house—from the north, see, got 
off, and sneake around to the east 
end of the shack. .The windows was 
covered with cloths on the inside, 
which didn’t make me none to + sure 
about Shaw havin’ no dealin’s with 
erooks. It ain’t ordinary for a feller 
to be so savin’ on light. Pretty soon 
we found a tear in one of the cloths. 
and lookin’ through that we seen old

Zis daughter on the other side.

funding measure, which already has 
passed the house. | 

The funding bill was reported to the 

senate by the finance committee Mon- 


day, without the restrictions to which |: 


President Harding objected. - 


Debate will begin at once, and 
threatens to develop into a broad dis- 
cussion of the whole European eco- 


nomie and financial stiuation, and the 


relation of these to military expendi- 
tures—particularly land armgments. 

This was indicated Monday when 
the senate adopted, without objection, 
a resolution by Senator McCormick, 
of Illinois, calling on the state depart- 
ment for information about the bud 
gets and deficits of foreign govern- 
ments, Their expenditures for land 
armaments, and their indebtedness to 
the United States, 

MceCormick’s resolution is aimed 
Ppartixplarly at France. He is one of 
of senators who contend that 
the European nations are able to 
make extravagant military outlays 
through the default of interest on 
their loans. The effect, he argues, is 
the same as if the United States were 
paying for the maintenance of the 
armies and navies. It is useless. he 
contends, for America to seek to help

DUBLIN CASTLE NOW 
was OFS 


e Seen. \ 


Dublin, January 16.— (By the 
Associated Press.) — A delegation 
of the Irish provisional govern- 
ment, consisting of Eamon J. Dug- 
gan and Kevin O'Higgins, will go 
to London tomorrow to meet a 
committee of the British cabinet 
to complete the details of trans- 
ferring authority to the provision- 
al government. 


Dublin, January 16.—Dublin cas- 
tle, the most hated symbol of Hgit- 
ish rule over Ireland, has fallen in 
peaceful capitulation to the Irish pro- 
visional government. 

Headquarters of the British viceroy, 
and housing all the departments of 
state connected with the king's gov- 
ernment over southern Ireland, the 
castle was turned over to Michael 
Collins as president of the temporary 
government set up under the terms 
of the Irish peace treaty. ‘The cere- 
mony of transfer took place in the fa- 
mous privy council chamber, where 
Lord Fitzalan received the eight mem- 
bers of the Irish government, while 
thousands of rejoicing Dublin citi- 
zens crowded the grounds and streets 
leading to the great mansion, 

. Withstood Siege. 

Dublin castie was besieged in the 
Easter rebellion of 1916, but with- 
stood the attack of the republicans. 
Since that time its occupants have 
been practically prisoners, and when- 
ever a member of the household ven- 
tured out he was accompanied by a 
strong guard of troops and rode in 
an armored automobile. 

Barbed wire entanglements and a 
powerful force of British soldiers con- 
stituted a continual defense against 
a surprise, and these emblems of war 
are now being removed. 

For the last time under the old 
rule, the imperial troops in the castle 
court yard nf&unted guard Monday 
and then marched away. 

Officials of the empire were also 
present at the official transference of 
authority. 


ops Leaving. 

Lord Fitzalan informed Collins and 
his associates that he would immedi- 
ately communicate with the British 
government in order that the comple- 
tion of the transfer of “all powers 
and machinery requisite for the dis- 
charge of its duties” to the new gov- 
ern might be speedily accomplished. 

Roughly, ten thousand troops re- 
main to be withdrawn. Other units 
are being evacuated as rapidly as 
transportation permits, and all army 
stores are being removed concurrently. 


Refuses to Open 
Restaurant Safe 


AndIsBadlyHurt 


The bravery of Sam Angelides, em- 
ployee of a restaurant at 20 West 
Alabama street, saved his employers a 
loss of more than $700 Monday morn- 
ing, and cost him a brutal beating, 
which may result in his death. 

As he entered the restaurant about 
4 o’clock to begin his work he was held 
up by three masked white robbers, 
who had been hiding in the place and 
was ordered to open the restaurant 
1 which they had been unable to

Two men held pistols on him, and 
whe nhe flatly refused to open the 
safe the third man hit him on the head 
with a pistol, knocking him to the 
floor, his skull being fractured when 
he hit de tile floor. The bandits then 
bound a handkerchief about his mouth 
and saturated it with chloroform. 

When his employer, Pete Poulos, 
and Henry Polk, the janitor, entered 
the restaurant about half an hour 
later they heard the sound of running 
feet from the kitchen. The police were 
called and Angelides removed to Grady 
hospital, where his condition was pro- 
nounced critical.

New Development 


BY FUZZY WOODRUFF. 
Atlanta theatergoers sat face to face 
with Lew Cody yesterday at the 
Metropolitan theater and had a whole 
lot of difficulty in recognizing him 


as the lover of the movies for whom 


proud maidens sigh and with each 


become a matinee idol. 
the kind of a name to wish on a 


fellow who wears spats. Anyhow, I 
discovered in a precious few minutes 
of personal contact with Mr. Cod 


that the name fits him like the bark 
on a tree or like his own habiliments 
for that matter. He has become a 
matinee idol because the exigencies of 
a motion picture career demanded it, 
but removed from the silversheet, he 
is Lew Cody in all the rather plain, 
wholesome nomenclature implies. 

He’s a good-sized, two-fisted man, 
who talks in @ good round baritone 
voiee, and who uses actual English— 
which precious few motion picture 
persons do—except when he uses 
expletives, which he does with decora- 
tive effect every time his thoughts run 
to censors and censorship. . 

Typical of Better Days. 

After having talked with him for the 
better part of an hour, I’m pretty 
well convinced that Mr. Cody is typi- 
cal of the better days that are cuming 
for the movies, that he is an embodi- 
ment of the weal things of life rather 
than the little sham things of exist- 
ence, which the-movies have been in- 
sisting on cramming down the people 
willy nilly for the past two or three 
vears. 

He has advanced theories about the 
motion picture industry and its use- 
fulness—the most advanced of which 
is that the motion picture with a 
mass appeal is dying just as surely 
as if it had taken poison. 

“Now, mind you,” he explanied with 
expletives aforementioned, “I’m not 
finding any fault with the movies as 
they exist today as a moral force. 
The blankety blank censors have 
made us so dot dashed moral that 
we've become innocuous. We are not 
permitted to display firearms in a 
scene, while the master crook and the 
herdic yeggman stride unmolested 
through the pages of every bit of our 
current reading matter except the At- 
alntic Monthly. A 

“Censorship has no part in the de- 
velopment in the motion picture in- 
dustry that I’m talking about. I wish 
it didn’t have any part in anything, 
but that’s another story. 

No Mass Appeal. 

“But my idea is this: We've pro- 
gressed beyond the point in motion 
picture entertainment where we can 
build a picture—save in very rare in- 
stances—that is going to appeal to 
everybody and that is what the mo- 
tion picture industry has been trying 
to do. 

“Now, it’s manifestly impossible to 
have a picture that is going to strike 
a responsive chord in both a scholarly 
man and a rolled stocking flapper, or 
in a fine old grandmother, who re- 
velled in romances like ‘St. Elmo,’ 
and a matron of today, who has.con- 
niption fits whenever Kobert W. Chal- 
mers writes a best seller. 
as obviously foolhardy to try to please 
a newsboy with a picture that might 
go splendidly with a farmhand. 

“Then, what’s the answer? By 
striving to please everybody with one 
picture, the prodycers are usually 
pleasing nobody. Each patron sees 
two or three pictures, disappointing 
to them personally, though the great 
majority: of the audience may dike it 
—but the patrons that don't like t 
quit going, and gradually motion pic- 
ture attendance drops off to nothing. 

Cure for Ailment. 

“Now, as I see it, here is the cure 
for this ailment. Build theaters of 
limited seating capacity, build a num- 
ber of them. Let this theater be recog- 
nized as the house that shows melo- 
drama. Let that one specialize in 
satirical comedy. Let still another 
one provide triangles. Let the one 
across the street promote the pulchri- 
tude of bathing beauties. Each class 
will know what it wants to see and 
where it can see it. No one is going 
to be disappointed—for the producers 
can turn out good stuff when they 
recognize the want they bave to fill 
and the whole industry is going to 
grow again. 

“And, mark my words, when that 
thing is done you're going to see the 
long-awaited development in cinema 
art. I am making this tour of the 
country largely in anticipation of that 
development. By coming in contact 
with the people, I am finding out what 
they want, and when I get back I’m 
going to try to give it to them: 

“You see, I’m not only an actor, 
but I’m a producer, so I’m not down 
here parading myself as a star. I 
am studying every minute I’m on this 
trip.” 

Anybody who saw Mr. Cody’s per- 
sonal appearance” will recognize that 
he is not only a movie actor and a 
producer of no minor merit, but is an 
actor of tremendous histrionic ability. 

In fact, his “personal appearance“ 
is something absolutely refreshing. He 
is the one motion picture actor I've 
éver come in contact with who can 
do something more than smile and 
smirk when he is encountered by a 
crowd. 

And the crowds were out to see 
Lew Cody—no discounting that. 

He will be here the rest of the week.

Golden became a stamp like “sterling”

For the cast that returned with

Keith Vaudeville. 
(At the Lyric.) 

Duffey and Kellar in their skit. 
“Via Telephone,” present the head- 
line act for the firet part of the 
week at Keith’s Lyric theater. Their 
act is original and clever and their 
lines are full of good fun. 8 

Berrick and Hart, in “Eloping, 
also captivated audiences Monday 
night, and but for some rather 
clumsy lines, might have taken the 
place gained by Duffy and Kellar, 

A hearty reception was given to 
Gene and Minette, who presented 
songs and instrumental music. Both 
were excellent musicians and they 
received much applause. 

Barton and Clark in their act, 
“Columbia and Victor,“ have a neat

Loew Vaudeville. 


(At the Grand.) . 

Soldier boys as chorus girls, and 
they're putting it over in Getting 
It Over,” the featured vaudeville 
attraction at Loew’s Grand theater 
for the first half of the week. “Get- 
ting It Over” is a musical farce with 
plenty of surprises. The act is 
presented by eight soldier stars, the 
original stars of the Twenty-sev- 
enth division show as presented in 
France during the late war for the 
entertainment of the expeditionary 
forces, It is a thoroughly enjoy- 
able performance and draws laughs 
from start to finish. 

Josephine Harmon in a “Bit of 
Gab” tells a number of good stories 
and has several songs that score, 
her chatter is entertaining, 

Hodge and Howell have a “Rube” 
act that ts especially good. Both 
members of the team make typical 
rubes and present their songs in 
an amusing manner, Ulis and 
Clark form a clever combination; 
Miss Howell possessing good looks 
as well as the ability to sihg and 
dance. The balancing act of Foley 
and Sparton is one of the best of 
rt 7 nd that has been here in some 
time, : 

William Russell and Sylvia Brea- 
mer are the stars of an interesting 
photodrama titled “The Roof Tree.” 


Wallace Reid. 


(At the Howard.) 

In these days of high rents and 
profiteering landlords, “Rent Free,” 
a new Paramount picture starring 
Wallace Reid, which was shown at 
the Howard theater last night, 
starts an audiente off with a happy 
thought and succeeds in keeping 
them laughing to the final fade-out. 

There is a lively plot and plenty 
of action,s a good deal of which 
supposedly takes place on the roofs 
of two NeweYork rooming houses. 
Wallace Reld plays the young ar- 
tist who shuffles for himself rather 
than study law in his father’s of- 
fice. To get the better of the rent 
problem, he moves up on the roof, 
and later establishes himself in a 
house, the owners of which are 
away, and then. comes the fun, 
which you can’t afford to miss. 

The “Beggar Maid,” a short dra- 
matic picture, scores, as something 
distinctly individua] in motion pic- 
tures, 

The “Chocolate Soldier” as the 
overture received from the. audience 
sincere appreciation. The Howard 
News and Views and the sextet 
from “Lucia,” especially arranged 
by Harry Hughes, of the Howard, 
completes one of the most pleasing 
and diversified performances ever 
Slven at the Howard theater. 


“The Idle Rich.” 


(At the Metropolitan.) 
Bert Lytell, in his newest Metro 
starring vehicle, “The Idle Rich,” is 
the offering at the Metropolitan this

ing three generations of the Weath-

manners of the three periods, the 
family resemblances and the indi- 


vidual marks of distinction in the 


three men.” 


“Affairs of Anatol.” 


(At the Vaudette.) 

As has often been said good 
things are always patronized and 
this was the case at the Vaudette 
theater Monday, where Cecille De- 
Mille’s million-dollar production, 
“The Affairs of Anatol,” was pre- 
sented. This is the first and only 
picture that can boast of an all- 
star cast, for no less than a dozen 
of the most noted celebrities appear 
in the main roles. Wallace Reid 
and Gloria. Swanson are the main 
stars, while Bebe Daniels, Elliott 
Dexter, Agnes Ayers, Wanda Haw- 
ley, Theodore Roberts are the chief 
support. 


“Fighting Mad.” 
(At the Strand,) 

It is a thrilling story of rapid 
action, dealing with love, romance 
and adventure which William Des- 
mond portrays in “Fightin’ Mad,” 
a Metro release for William Des- 
mond Productions, which opened at 
the Strand theater Monday. 

In this story by H. H. Van Loan, 
the youthful hero finde life on a 
ranch too quiet to suit his adven- 
turous disposition and decides to 
join ¢he border patrol. He gets 
a stormy reception from his future 
comrades, but his two-fisted way 
of meeting all obstacles wins him a 
place and friends who stick to him 
in his daring attempt to rescue the 
girl of his love from bandits. 


“Shattered Dreams.” 


(At the Tudor.) 

Threads of romance, intrigue, 
mystery, love, fate and human char- 
acter development are woven into a 
fascinating plot in “Shattered 
Dreams,“ the Universal spetial at- 
traction starring Miss du Pont at 
the Tudor theater, 

Miss du Pont’s work should com- 
mend her to fans. In False Kiss- 
es,” her preceding vehicle, she had 
a story of extreme realism, almost 
bitter in its significance, 

In “Shattered Dreams” she has 
just as much of the more intimate 
phases of life, and in addition, the 
plot involves a wonderful study in 
the development of a man’s soul 
after it had been shrunk by the 
ruinous wrack and hardship of war. 
Miss du Pont impersonates a young 
art student of the Latin quarter of 
Paris, She takes under her wing 
an apache who seeks to rob her 
studio, and makes of him a man. 


FIVE-CENT LOAF

Following Strike 


Richmond, Va., January 16,—Com- 
plete tieup of the electric lines of the 
irginia Railway and Power company 
in Richmond, Norfolk and Porthmouth 
résulted tonight at 7:30 o’clock when 
the last car running over the lines in 
this city was taken into the barns. 
Service in Norfolk and Portsmouth 
ceased at 5 o'clock this afternoon. 

Three lincs were operated by the 
company here today. e South Rich- 
mond line consisted of only one car. 
A ten-minute schedule was operated on 
other lines, according to statements of 
the representatives of the power com- 
pany. 

Instructions sent out from the head- 
quarters of the men Sunday night that 
the union workers do nothing to incite 
criticism from the public were ob- 
served. No disturbances on the part 
of the union men occurred at any of 
the terminals. The only arrests of the 


day resulted when “outsiders” jeered 


the crew of one of 12 cars operated 
by the company here today. Three 
of these “sympathizers” were taken 
into custody and bailed for their ap- 
pearance in police court tomorrow 
morning. 

The first day of the strike, which 
resulted from action of the company 
in announcing a decrease in the sal- 
aries of the men, effective today, 
found three of the four lines operating 
in Virginia practically at a standstill 
during the day. A few cars were 
run in Richmond, Norfolkeand Ports- 
mouth, but the service was so far be- 
low normal that it hardly was notice- 
able. There was no curtailment in

COUGH IS YOUR 
DANGER SIGNAL * 


Chronie coughs and persistent colds — 
lead to serious Jung trouble. You can 
stop them now with Oreemulsion, an 
emulsified creosote that is pleasant to 
take. Creomulsion is a new medical 
discovery with twofold action; it 
soothes and heals the inflamed mem- 
branes and kills the germ. 

Of all known drugs, creosote is 
recognized by the medical fraternity as 
the greatest healing agency for the 
treatment of chronic coughs and colds 
and other forms of throat and lung 
troubles. Creomulsion contains, in 
addition to creosote, other healing ele- 
ments which soothe and heal the in- 
flamed membranes and stop the irrita- 
tion and inflammation, while the cre- 
osote goes on to fhe stomach, is ab- 
sorbed into the blood, attacks the seat 
of the trouble and detsroys the germs 
that lead to consumption. : 

»Creomulsion is guaranteed satisfac- 
tory in the treatment of chronic eorghs 
and colds, bronchial asthma, catarrha! 
bronchitis and other forms of throat 
and lung diseases, and is excellent for 
building up the system after colds or 
the flu. Money refunded if any cough 
or cold, no matter of how long stand- 
ing, is not relieved after taking accord- 
ing to directions. Askeyour druggist.

with prices higher. 


New York, January 16—There was a strong opening this morning 
Then the market eased off. Around eleven, how- 


ever, under the leadership of the automobile shares an upward move- 


ment began in which the oils and rails joined. Studebaker, which start- | 


ed to advance about ten days ago around 80, opened at Saturday’s clos- 
ing price, 841-2. Traders figured that if 85 was reached and crossed the 


price would go higher. 


It touched 86 1-4 around half past one. : 


Insiders in Studebaker are predictmg 125 for the stock this year. 


They say that at this time 


last year there was $4,000,000 cash in hand 


with $8,000,000 owed the banks; that 1922 began with $9,000,000 cash 
on hand and all bank loans paid; that $15 a share was earned last year 
over the $7 dividend paid; that firm orders are now on the books for 
25,000 cars; that 1922 will be a better year for the company than 1921. 

With call money hanging around 3 1-2 per cent the same thing hap- 


pened today that has happened before. 


Out-of-town banks called in 


their balances here, figuring that 3 3-4 or better could be earned on he 


money at home. 


This resulted in quite a lot of calling of loans by che 


Wall street banks, with the call rate opening at 31-2 and at 4 around 


noon, 


It was predicted that 5 per cent would be touched and that pos- 


sibly the Federal Reserve bank here might not cut its rediscount rate 
Wednesday as had been expected. However, time money was easy and 


the advance in cal] rates had ‘no effect on the stock market. 


Brokers, 


that is a number of the larger houses, are planning to do business for 


the first three or four months of the year at least on call money. They 


figure that the major trend of stock market prices during the year will 
be upward but with minor downward movements when the market be- 


comes overbought. 


One main reason why the stock market started to 


; advance late last week was that the decline brought out no liquidation. 


Another is cheap money. 
- Dividends Resumed. 

Last week Copper Range resumed 
dividends. This week a small Boston 
company, the New Cornelia, is going 
to resume dividends. These straws 
are significant. 

Erie has contracted with n 


Youngstown company recently formed 
to do all the repair work on equip- 
ment at its Kent, Ohio, shop. 

During the week ending January 
14, the War Finance corporation 
made 455 loans for agricultural and 
livé stock purposes, involving $12,- 

A very strong banking syndicate, 
made up of Morgan, the First Na- 
tional bank, the National City, Harris 
Forbes, the Guaranty Trust and the 
Bankers’ Trust, will make an offering 
tomorrow of $30,0000,000 Southern 
railway 61-2 per cent development 
and general mortgage bonds, due in 
1956, a 941-2, to yield 6.90. ‘The 
funds thus raised will be used to pay 
off the $25,0000,000 notes falling due 
March 1. It was learned today, too, 
that the government has agreed to re- 
new for five years, at 6 per cent in- 
terest, the $25,240,000 St. Paul notes 
falling due March 1. The new notes 
will be secured by deposit of 835.229, 
000 bond now held by St. Paul in its 
treasury. Thus, it appears from these 
two announcemetns, that the railroads 
that can find a reasonable market for 
new securities, must look out for 
themselves, while the government will 
Jook out for others. That is as it 
should be. 

Thomas W. Lamont, recently back 


from Mexico, says that country, after 
ten years of revolution, is wearied of 
strife and anxious for peace. As for 
the outlook in this country, Lamont 
predicts that there will be improve- 
ment in general trade by spring; that 
commodity prices will slowly cree 
back to normal levels; that there will 
be gradual unlocking of farmers’ 
loans; that there will be evening up 
of the disparity between prices of 
farm products and manufactured 
goods; that by autumn there will be 
sufficient recovery in business to make 
us all feel that the sun is again 
shining. 
Prices Up. 

Sauerbeck’s index number of whole- 

sale prices at the end of December 


was up 2.9 points, compared with the 
close of November, according to to- 
day’s cables from London. The fig- 
ure was 133.6, against 130.6, at the 
close of November, 261.4 in March of 
1920, and 81.2 in June of 1914, or 
just before the war started. The in- 
erease for December was the first 
break in a decline that had been go- 
ing on steadily since the end of last 
July, when the figure was 158.2. While 
England’s prices went higher than 
ours, the general trend in the advance 
and then in the decline, has been 
about the same as here. The national 
industrial conference here reports to- 
day that the cost of living in this 
country, as a whole, advanced from 
1914 to 1921. The latest reports 
compiled, 63 per cent, then declined. 
that is from the top to the end of 
November, 20.3 per cent. .

New York, January 16.—The cot - 
ton market was weak and unsettled 
today, with prices selling into new 
low ground for the movement. March 


contracts declined to 17.34, or 
points below the closing quotation of 
last week, and $9.30 à bale below the 
high price touched ui the opening on 
January 3. That delivery closed at 
17.56, with the genera: market closing 
steady at a net decline of 20 to 34 
points on cover:ng. 
The market opened. barely steady, 
at a decline of 10 tw points, in 
response to lower Eiverpool cables. 
Private advices attributing the decline 
in the English market to increased 
hedge selling revived last week's up- 
prehenaions of spot liquidation in the 
South, and there was also selling on 
neporis of good rains in the south- 
west, 
eule down, but it was very limited, 
nd the mutket showed increasing 
weakness during the middle of the day, 
owing partly to persistent selling by 
brokers with southern connections, 
Naturally, this pressure served to 
Color the talk of an easier spot sit- 
uation, and as prices worked lower 
stop orders were uncovered on every 
J-point drop. January sold off to 
17.40, and May to 17.08, making net 
declines of 40 to 60 points on the 
more active positions, after which 
liquidation became less active, and 
there were rallies from the lowest on 
covering or scattered buying for a re- 
aétion. Some further trade buying 
was also reported late in the after- 
noon, but it was by no means active 
and the closing bulge was attributed 
chiefly to the stronger technical po- 
sition of the market. 
- Reports received here from Norfolk 
said there was no pressure of spot 
cotton there, but the talk of an easier 
basis was more or less general around 
the ring, and the fear of spot liquida- 
tion was considered the .main factor 
on the decline, There .was also an 
expectation that the break in raw 
Material would further retard busi- 
ness in cotton goods.

Much of the early selling was due 
to a: poor Liverpool, but discussion on 
the floor of the exchange was mfittly 
centered on international polities. 
Manchester cables created an unfavor- 
able impression, as they stated that 
while more business was being done, 
there were no signs of a general re- 
vival. Prices were a dollar to a dollar 
and a half a bale off on these features. 

_In_the late morning reports were 
circulated on the floor of the ex- 
change ok further rioting in India, and 
during the selling that followed stop 
loss orders were caught on the long 
side in considerable volume. Rains in 
Texas and in sections of the central 
and eastern portions of the belt were 
regarded as highly favorable, and 
added to the selling pressure, which 
was not checked until a demand of 
consequence arose from the shorts 
themselves.

LEAD STOCK TRADE 


New York. January 16.—Purchase 
of railread shares on a comprehensive 
Scale and at gross gains of 1 to 3 
points furnished a firm foundation for 
today’s active and generally strong 
stock market. 

There were several exceptions to 
the advance, mainly among stocks in 


which the short interest continuell 
dominant. Crucible Steel, Interna- 
tional Paper, National Enameling 
and several obscure specialties were

Equipments, motors, several of the 
independent steels, as well as coppers, 
utilities, textiles and miscellaneous 
specialties were sustained by the de- 
mand for rails. Hesitation was shown 
by oils during the greater part of 
the session, but that group came for- 
ward in the final hour with Mexican 
Petroleum the central feature. Sales 
amounted to 800,000 shares. 

For the most part closing prices 
were irregularly under maximum quo- 
tations, extensive realizi g being pro- 
voked by the steady advance of money 
rates. Call loans opened at 3 1-2 per 
cent, but rose gradually to 6 per cent 
just before the end. The firmer mon- 
ey rates were attributed to withdraw- 
al of federal deposits from local banks. 

Foreign affairs made little impres- 
sion on the market for international 
remittances, and most domestic devel- 
opments over the week-end received 
favorable interpretation. A canvass 
of conditions in the middle west con- 
firmed recent advices of prospective 
revival in many fines of manufacture, 
although railroad tonnage showed fur- 
ther reductions from the correspond- 
ing period of last year. 

The bond market moved contrary to 
the tone of stocks, prices in that quar- 
ter showing considerable éonfusion, 
which extended to Liberty issues, all 
of that series closing at moderate re- 
cessions. New underwritings are 
projected by railroad and domestic, 
and Canadian municipalities. Total 
sales, 1 value, 818,750,000.

GUARANTY TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK, Trustee 


* shone 


Fairfax Harrison, Esq., President of Southern Railway Company, has summarized for us as follows his 


The Bonds will be issued under the Development and General M dated April 18, 1906, and 
the principal, as well as interest at the rate of 4% pe r annum, will be s by the of that Mortgage. 
Pursuant to a Supplement Indenture, the Company is to affix to the Bonds its obligation to pay 2% 4o 
additional interest, thus making the total interest rate 644% per annum. The 24% % interest obli- 
gation will not be secured by the Development and General Mortgage, but in the Supplemental Indenture 
the Company will covenant that it will not create any new mortgage upon any part of the railways subject 
to the Development and General Mortgage unless such new mortgage expressly shall secure the payment 
of the additional interest obligation equally and ratably with any indebtedness secured by such new mort- 
gage. The total 614% interest obligation is ‘combined in the several coupons. 


. The proceeds of the sale of these Bonds will be used by the Company to pay its Three-Year Secured 
Gold Notes maturing March 1, 1922, to pay a demand loan owed to War Finance Corporation, and to reim- 


burse the Company’s treasury in small-part for capital expenditures. 


Since the Development and General Mortgage was created in 1906, the Company’s capital expenditures . 
on the property subject to the Mortgage have exceeded $135,000,000, upwards of $40,000,000 of which 
was from cash derived from earnings. The new capital hag been used to provide improved facilities for 
the efficient and economical handling of traffic. : 


A comparison of the earnings and traffic results in 1920 with those in 1905 shows the following 
growth and expansion: 


Gross earnings per mile of road increased... ......c0ceceeccsccescscesenssmelel 
Revenue ton-miles per mile of road nnr, . 
Average earnings per freight - train mile . . „ bbewke eee 
Passenger miles per mile of road in ——U 1 *Vã 370 . 132. 
Average earnings per passenger train -mile increase... 169.4 


During the 514 years ended December 31, 1917 (when the property was taken over for operation by 
the Federal Railroad inistration), the average of the Company’s annual net income, after deducti 

rentals and miscellaneous income charges, was nearly I times the average annual interest charges. 
“standard return” rentalduring Federal control was limited to $18,653,893 per annum (as with 
$26,085,574, the actual net operating income for the calendar year 1917), it was sufficient, together 
with the Company's other income, to produce a total income equal to about 11 times the 2 in- 
‘terest charges. The Company's net operating income has recovered from the low touched in the 
latter part of 1920 and the early part of 1921, the monthly average rising from $357,324 for the first six 
months of 1921 to $2,004,377 for the succeeding five months. 


The location and extent of the Southern Railway System are im 
Company’s owned amd affiliated lines, reaching fr Washington, 
Louis and Memphis to Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Mobile and 
cities in the South, traverse a territory yielding a growing traffic of wide 
and manufactured products.

The shrewd investor knows that he

The original owner suffered a price

London, January 16.—Rumors of 
the possible postponement of the eco- 


nomie conference at Genoa until the 


Anglo-French situation has become 
clarified have arisen as the result of 
well-defined sentiment in- official cir-

“If I Could Only 


Belch Up That Gas 


IKnow! Would Feel Better’, 


How often have you felt that way. How 
often have you wished for something to 
give you gennine and lasting relief for Gas? 

Don’t buy any ordinary dyspepsia tablet 
for temporary results. Go to a first-class 
drug store, ask for a bottle of genuine 
Baalmann’s Gas-Tablets; take three tab- 
lets an hour before meals and again three 
before eating—then watch.. Now comes a 
surprise. No more gas, no more smothered 
feeling, no difficult breathing, and no bloat, 

Remember, Baalmann's Gas-Tablets are 
not only for the relief, but also for the 
prevention of Gas. Most people with Gas 
suffer from nervous Dyspepsia, not common 
indigestion. 

Baalmann’s Gas-Tablets are sold in the 
famous yellow package for one dollar.

BOY’S CURIOSITY 
CAUSES RECOVERY 
OF SILVERWARE 


Growing suspicious of a basket that 
a negro was carrying, about 8:30 
o’clock-Monday night, W. D. Smith, a 
15-year-old white boy, living at 106 
Auburn avenue, stopped the colored 
pedestrian to question him as to the 
contents of the basket, and when the 
latter took to his heels gave hot 
pursuit. 

With several companions, young 
Smith was standing on the corner of 
Auburn avenue and Oourtland street, 
when the negro walked by with the 
basket under his arm, in which they 
could see à collection of silver spdonn. 

When Smith began questioning the 
negro;~one of his companions phoned 
for the police, and the negro fled 
down Courtland street, closely follow- 
ed by Smith. After a short run, he 
dropped the basket. which contained 
several electric-irons and silverware 
valued at between $50.and $75. 

About 10 o'clock. Call Officers Cody 
and Bullard arrested a negro, Ed 
Coburn. aged 52, who gave his address 
He is believed 
to be the negro who dropped the 
basket earlier in the evening.
