Lillian Rasscil | 
To Probe Working 


Immigration Law 
She Sails for Europe Deter- 


mined to End Tragedy 
of “Quota Cases.” 


New York, January 17.—Lillian 
Russell sailed on the steamship 
George Washington, Tuesday, deter- 
mined to get at the heart of the Amer- 
ican immigration question. 

The famous actress holds a com- 
mission as immigration inspector, 
which she was given after long con- 
ferences with Secretary of Labor 
Davis. She expects to play a hu- 
manity role in a tragedy that she de- 
clares has held already too much 
heartache and suffering. 

Followed by dozens of farewell mes- 
sages from citizens who have relatives 
onthe other side, Miss Russell—who 
is the wife of Alexander’ P. Moore, 
pittsburg publisher—will visit the 
ports of embarkation in England, Italy 
and France, to discover why immi- 
grants who have staked their all on: 
the hope of reaching America are al- 
lowed to start on a fruitless journey. 

“TI am going to find out,” she said, 
“just what are the conditions which 
permit a mother to sail for America 
when it is practically certain that her 
family will be broken up as a result. 

“The provisions that allow. a mother 
to come in and send her children back 
just because they were born in an- 
other country seems to me absurd, 
and I hope something can be done 
about the matter at the source of the 
trouble. 

“I am especially interested in the 
welfare of the children. The immi- 


taken up again tomorow, with all 
signs pointing to a long and inter- 


would bind the United States, moa 
Britain, Japan, France, Italy, Bel- 


gration law, in restricting the en- 
trance of children, as beyond the 
quota limit, seems to me all wrong. It 
should be changed as it frequently 
does serious injustice.” 

Miss Russell described some ‘of her 


cium, Portugal anit ‘The ‘Mernertanay+“™dines during years -of -inyeatign,

ence in China nor secure concessions 
or ‘monopolies' which would abridge

Except for another inconclusive ses- 
sion of the Shantung negotiators

fortifications agreement,. the meeting 
of the Far Eastern committee con- 


tivities during the \ day. At the 
Shantung conversations tne question 
of mines was discussed with no ap- 


problem remained unsolved tonight 
despite receipt by the Japanese of par- 
‘te instructions from Tokio. 

It was around the proposal for an 
| Mba into concessions now estab- 
lished in China as well as those pro- 
posed in the future, that mostof the 


centered. By some of the delegates 
it was understood that such an inquiry 


‘Japanese -holdings in Manchuria, 
while in other quarters it was sug- 
g° that the.resolution might, by 
indirection, lead to a review by the 
board of the famous “twenty-one de- 
mands” controversy. 
Hughes Questioned. 

In that connection it was pointed 

out that whereas the boerd’s duties 


in connection with future concessions 
would be confined under the terms of 


tion among the foreign born. “She was 
firmly conviiiced, she said, that mil 
owners should be compelled to educate 
the children who work‘for them. Shé 
was also of the opinion that some_re- 
dress should be given the aliens who 
come to this country penniless, only 
to be barred aft Ellis island. - “They 
have no homes, no friends to whom 
they can go back. Their plight is des- 
perate,” she asserted. 

Proudly holding her inspector's 


commission, Miss Russell seemed the 
picture of health while waiting for the 
ship to sail.

Washington, January 17.—After 
presentation of testimony by way of 
dlenial, war department records, sub- 


investigating charges that American 
soldiers hud“been hanged withoat triatt} - 
in France, showed that.on the bodies 
of two men dug np in the little ceme- 
tery at Bazéilles, the ropes and. black 
caps in which they ‘were put to death 
on the gallows had not been remeved 
prior to burial. 

Edwin E. Lamb, of Hartford, Conn., 
a colonel overseas, testified tha: in the 
case of one of the men hanged the 
body was placed quickly in a coffin 
and, so far as he recalled, the rope 
and cap were left just where the hang- 
man had placed them. But in both 
cases, other witnesses declared, they 
were. removed before the bodies were 
prepared for shipment home to rela 
tives. 

All Identified. 

Senator Watson, democrat, Georgia, 
whose charges concerning illegal exe- 
cutions led to the investigation, sharp- 
ly attacked the burial of men hanged 
for “unmentionable crimes” alongside 
of soldiers who fell in battle. Asking 
a witness if white men and negroes 
were buried in the same part of the 
cemetery, the senator was told that 
they were—that all were soldiers. 

Taking up the charges of former 
service men that bodies shipped here 
from France were handled in helter- 
skelter fashion, without proper effort 
to establish identity, officers and men 
attached to the graves registration 
service declared there was no founda- 
tion for such assertions, and insisted 
that not one body was brought home 


ly established. 

Turning from burial methods, John 
Sebastian, a sajlor of Jacksonville, 
Fla., told how, when a prisoner at 
Gievres, he saw the bodies of two ne- 
groes lying face down on the ground 
and was informed by a guard that two 
negroes had been lynched. He was 
unable, however, to say whether the 
bodies were those of the men put, to 
death by a soldier mob. 


Probe King Death. 

Through the insistence of Senator 
Overman, of North Carolina, the coin- 
mittee of which he is a member is 
determined to find out how Benjamin 
King, of Wilmington, N. C., a soldier 
with the 30th division, met death in 
All of the evidence thus far, 
and war department records, show that 
he was killed in action. His body 
Was never recovered, and men who 
were near him at the time declared 
that he was blown to pieces by a shell. 
Sent out in command of half a dozen 
men, King, a machine gun corporal, 
still was with his command when two. 
privates were killed, according to wit-'‘ 
nesses, *

Removal of discriminations said to 
have existed in intrastate freight rate 
classifications in Georgia is made in 
a new scale of tentative rates for 
classified traffic established by the 
state railroad commission in an order 
issued Tuesday. The new rates will 
be considered as tentative until March 
7, when a final hearing will be held 
to determine the permanency of the 
new scale. 

The new scale‘was established after 
extended hearings had been held in the 
case which is known as the Georgia 
freight rate case. The commission in- 
itiated the proceedings after the claim 
had been made that more than 1,000 
small towns and cities of Georgia were 
victims of discrimination to the bene- | 
fit of eighteen large cities through the

“In the:

fixed on as nearly a mileage basis as 
possible. The railroads of the state 
are divided into two classes, the larg- 
er lines and connections being placed 
in Class A and all other lines being 
placed in Class B. 

Many Reductions. 

Many reductions in classified rates 
are containéd in the new system, al- 
though some of the rates petween bas- } 
ing points, which include Atlanta and 
other large cities, are increased slight- 
ly. ‘The commission, in its order, in-

- Charges that City Warden W. H. 
Johnson had declined to give her finan-

by him were contained in a "a $10,000 
slander suit filed Tuesday in the Ful-

Harper, wife of an invalid war veter-

that as a further step to make her 
accede to his demands, Warden John-

port he was giving her by going to 
the uncle and telling him that shis 
niece was an immoral woman. 

Mr. Johnson could not be reached 
by The Constitution Tuesday night. 
Close friends of the official seoffed at 
the charges, and declared that they 
will be disproved. They intimated 
that the warden’s- political enemies 
were behind the suit.

Frank DuPre, confessed slayer of 
Pinkerton Detective Irby C. Walk-

morning over the Southern railway, 
The exact hour of arrival has been

DuPre’s nerve is shattered and his 
assumed braggadocio has vanished. He 
left Cincinnati Tuesday night on the 
last leg of the return journey.

With Frank B. DuPre in the hands 
of the law and scheduled to arrive 
in Atlanta Wednesday, where he will 
be promptly placed on trial for mur- 
der, keen interest centers on the per- 
sons who are entitled to the reward 
of $2,100 which was offered for his 
capture. — 

As discussion has been given the 
4 question and: reports that #ispute 
will probably arise among the con- 
tenders, sentiment among Atlanta of- 
ficers and in other official sources has 
narrowed the contest down to three 
persons, the two Detroit city detec- 
tives, who actually caught DuPre as 
he was waiting for a letter at the geh- 
eral delivery window. of the postof- 
fice, and Chief Hackett, of the Chat-

formation the capture is conceded to 
have been accomplished. 

Sergeants Paul Wencel and Wil-

“nabbed” DuPre when he asked for a 
letter which he hoped would bring 
him $200 im cash from the Chatta-

Criticises Building Cest. 

Mr. Heflin declared that a board 
which would permit orders to go out 
for the construction of a bank build- 
ing like that proposed for the New 
York federal reserve bank. and which 
is to cost around $20,000,000. was 

covered all over with suspicions of

re were “in no humor to foo] with 
hose fellows,” making up the reserve 
hoard, adding that it would be a great 
blessing if they would “get out so 
we could put others in who are not 
dominated by Wall street.” 

Onponents of the measure, headed 
by Senator McLean. made an attempt 
to stave off its passage just before 
the final vote by moving to send it 
hack to committee, but this wa de- 
feated, 52 to 17. 

Senator Harris, in addition to ‘the 
amendment compelling the reserve 
hanks .to ask congressional consent 
for construction of banking houses, 
sought to have the measure include a 
provision fixing a maximum redis- 
eonnt rate of 5 per cent on all trans-

the 

great reserve~ banking 

for the sake of politics,” Senator Gis, 
democrat, Virginia, declared 

senate ro Bid that much more gee 
would be accomplished for the coun- 
try .“if some senators and others 
would talk sense to the bankers in- 


stead of nonsense. to the farmers.” 
The Virginia senator, resuming a 


would place a farmer on the 
reserve board, said there was “abso- 
lutely no excuse” for thé barrage of 
attacks which had been levelled at the 
reserve system. 

“Why not tell the farmers the truth 
once?” queried the speaker. “Why 
insist on drawing the picture of de- 
flation and c¢tedits as the monster 
which. brought reduced prices, not 
alone on the farmer’s products, but 
on all ities? Why not show 
that a-lot of banks did not take ad- 
vantage of the resources of the reserve 
system and thereby impaired and lim- 
ited their own ability to aid?’ 


Decries “Nonsense.” 


Mr. Glass declared that “instead 
of the nonsense” spread among the 
farmers about how they had been vic- 
timized, the farmers should be told 
to “organize,” not to become the play- 
thing of fanatics, but for intelligent 
research, for co-operative marketing 
and to investigate and meet the influ- 
ences which may affect the prices of 
their products. Mr. Glass declared 
that no single thing was the deciding 
factor in the break in prices. He 
said that during the war people 
throughout the world learned to do 
without luxuries and asserted that 
there followed as a natural result 
“by the processes of psychology,” a 
general movement to economize in 
other things. The end of it all, he 
said, was a sort of a consumers’ 
strike against profiteering prices. 


“And I want to say,” he went on. 
“that the situation cannot be cured 
by the sickening tirade of politicians 
and indefensible attacks on the re 
serve banking system.” 

The senator said that 42 per cent 
of the banking power of the south 
was lodged in banks which have not 
me members of the reserve sys- 
tem and went on to show that in the 


tor Glass turned to/answer the 
many eeaaies which have ‘been made 
on the reserve board, most of which 
he said were by democratic. senators. 
He —— on the salaries of  offi- 
cials of the New York reserve bank 
and criticised Senator Heflin, demo- 
crat, Alabama, for what he described 
= “absolutely unfounded” attacks or 

em. 


want to say to the senator from 
Alabama,” continued Senator Glass, 
“that a banking institution as great 
as that of the New York federal ‘re- 


serve cannot be run ‘by a hod-carrier.. 


It can’t be run by a newspaper pub- 
lisher like myself. It takes talent of 
the highest caliber to conduct a bank 
whose business is greater than that 
of the Bank of England or the Bank 
of France, or any five. of the other 
federal banks combined.” 

The Virginia senator then cited a 
list of salaries paid officials of na- 
tional banks in New York showing 
that many bank presidents are re- 


ceiving from $40,000 to $100,000 year- - 


ly in salaries while the reserve bank’s 
highest salary is $50,000. 

The speaker read extracts from some 
of the many speeches on the subject 
by Mr. Heflin, saying as he did so 
that he desired to show “to what ex- 
tent ignorance on this subject may 
go.” Mr. Glass called attention to 
one statement which he said took up 
nine lines in the Congressional Rec- 
ord and which made six distinctive 
statements.” 

“Tt’s all right,” he added, “except 
that all of the six distinctive state- 
ments are wrong.” 

Heflin Answers. 

Mr. Heflin, answering Mr. Glass, 
denied that he had ever attacked the 
reserve system. He had contended, 
he said, only that the system had 
been maladministered since 1920, and 
added that he expected to continue to 

ke those charges. 

“T say, and I say again,” said Mr. 
Hieflin, “that the board’s deflation 
policy was murderous.” 

Mr. Heflin said that Mr. Glass was 
the only senator from the south or 
west who had defended the board, add- 


ing that “there’s been no real friend - 


of the farm defending the board.” 
When Mr. Glass rose at this.point,

that “during the very speech of the 
senator from Virginia, the governor

and. smiled his approval.” 

“How can it be done?” Mr. Hef- 
lin queried. “How can the board's 
murderous’ policy be defended? 

“The Virginia senator told a piti- 
ful tale,” Mr. Heflin continued, “of 
how he used to take the governor 
of the board away from nis desk at 
night, took him out: tur a ride to 
stave off exhaustion and save him from

by admirers of Mr. Wilson. No part 
of any money for the fund will be used 
for campaign expenses. 


Until next Monday, the closing day

Colonel Mercer, chairman, issugd the 
following statement Tuesday : 

“IT hope the friends of the Woodrow 
Wilson foundation, those who under- 


‘stand the greatness of Mr. Wilson, will 


not wait to be solicited to contribute 
to the fund, but will send their sub- 
scriptions to Mr. Clay, the treasurer, 
or to The Constitution or The Jour- 
nal, or take them to headquarters at 
the Piedmont hotel. There will be no 
‘drive’ for these contributions. 

Subscriptions Gratifying. 

e subscriptions Monday were 
wiciliites «though it does not. appear 
as successiu. as the ordinary ‘drive,’ 
because we have studiously avoided 
the program usually . adopted in a 
drive for funds. The foundation i is as- 


sured and Georgia’s quota is not at |

SUIT IS FILED

pendent on the city for support, as 
she had an uncle who would help her, 

At that time, it is claimed, Warden 
Johnson threatened to go to the uncle 
and tell him something that would 
cause him to decline any request for 
money from Mrs. Harper. 

Withdrew Support. 

It is alleged that he went to the 
uncle, said to be a well-known fifth 
ward grocer, and told him that Mrs, 
Harper was leading a notorious life. 
He told his story to the uncle so 
earnestly, it is claimed, that he believed 
it for a while and temporarily with- 
drew all contributions te his niece’s 
support. 

When questioned with regard to the 
suit by telephone Tuesday night, At- 
torney Drennan etated that efforts to 
have the official indicted on a state 
charge will be made when the Fulton 
grand jury meets. In Georgia sander 
is an indictable offense. 

Warden Johnson is one of the best- 
known citizens of the fifth ward. Ue 
is a former member of council, and for- 
merly served on the board of county 
commissioners. 


NEW SCALE TO BAN 
RATE DISCRIMINATIONS 


Continued from First Page. 


— 


dered the carriers of the state to sub- 
mit for consideration a new list of 
intrastate freight rates which would 
abolish the basing system and estab- 
lish the mileage system. The com- 
mission’s order provided that the rates 
submitted should not produce reve- 
nue in excess of the amount derived 
under the present system. 

The hearing of the case lasted 
several weks. . Representarves of the 
carriers submitted their new scale of 
rates and these rates were then ex- 
amined by shippers and where protest 
was deemed necssary such protest was 
filed. Evidence in rebuttal was then 
submitted by both carriers and ship- 
pers, and final arguments in the case 
were made by representatives of both 
sides in the case. 

Executive Session. 

After the case was submitted the 
commission worked on it for several ; 
weeks. An executive session was held 
Tuesday and the tentative scale of 
rates was announced at this session.

report,” it would be authorized to in- 
uire into existing concessions “for 

e purpose of endeavoring to arrive 
= a satisfactory adjustment of equi- 
table terms.”’ Many questions regard- 
ing the meaning of the resolution were 
asked of Secretary. Hughes and an- 
swered by him during the committee 
meeting, but there still was apparent 
among the delegates tonight a divér- 
gence of view as to the exact powers 
recy might be assumed by the new 


In the Chinese delegation the Amer- 
ican plan was hailed as a long step 
in the direction of\ restored Chinese 
integrity. By American spokesmen 
a similar view was expressed, but 
most of the other delegations with- 
held comment. ‘The proposal had 
taken them by surprise and when they 
realized its possible extent they all 
indicated that a minute study of 
details would be necessary before ac- 
tion could be taken. 


Embarrassing Silence. 


So completely unexpected was the 
proposal, in fact, that when Secre- 
tary Hughes had completed its read- 
ing at the committee meeting there 
was an interim of silence which dele- 
gates said became embarrassing be- 
fore it was broken.’ After the several. 
delegations had waited for some time 
without anyone volunteering to open 
discussion, Senator Schanzer, head of 
the Italians, rose and asked a ques- 
tion about the meaning of some of 
the provisions. Secretary Hughes’ 
reply opened up a general discussion 
which continued with some animation 
for three hours. 

Text of Proposals. 

The Hughes proposals were put for- 
ward in the form of a resolution, the 
official text of. which follows: 

“THE OPEN DOOR IN CHINA. 

“(Revised Draft of Resolution.) 

“1. With the view to applying 
more effectually the pain neciples of the 
open door or equality of opportunity 
in China for the trade and industry 
of all nations, the powers other than 
China represented at this conference 
agree— 

“(A) Not to seek or to support 
their nationals in seeking any arrange- 
ment which might purport to estab- 
lish in favor of their interests any 
general superiority of rights with re- 
spect to commercial or economic de- 
velopment in any designated region of 
China. 

“(B) No to neck oy to support their 
nationals in seeking any sucn monop- 
oly or preference as would deprive 
other nationals of the right of under- 
taking any legitimate trade or indus- 
try in China or of participating with 
the Chinese government or with any 
provincial government in any eate- 
gory Of public enterprise, or which by 
reason of its Scope, duration or geo- 

«raphical extent is calculated to frus- 
trate the practical application of the 
principle of opportunity. 

“Tt is understood that this agree- 
ment is not to be so construed as.to 
prohibit the acquisition of such prop- 
erties or rights as may be necessary 
to the conduct of a particular com: 
mercial, industrial or financial un- 
dertaking or to the encouragement of 
invention and research, 

“2. The Chinese government takes 
note of the above agreement and de- 
clares its intention of betng guided by 
the same principles in dealing with 
applications for economic rights and 
privileges from governmients and na- 
tionals of all foreign countries whether 
parties to that agreement or not. 

“3. The powers, including China, 
represented at this conference, agree 
in principle .to the establishment in 
China of a board of reference to which 
any question arising on the above 
agreement and declaration may be 
referred for investigation and report. 

“4. The powers, including China, 
represented at this conference, agree 
that any povisions of an existing 
concession which appear inconsistent 
with those of another concession or 
with the principles of the above 
agreement or declaration may be sub- 
mitted by the parties concerned to the 
board of reference when esablished for 
the purpose.of endeavoring to arrive at 
a satisfactory adjustment on equitable 
terms.” :

Miss Emery was born in Dorchester, 
Mass. On October 16, 1871, the wom- 
an’s auxiliary to the board of domestic 
and foreign missions of the church 
was organized at Baltimore. Miss 
Mary Abbott Emery, a sister, became 
its first secretary. She was succeed- 
ed by Miss Julia Emery, who served 
from 1876 to 1916, when failing health 
made her resignation necessary. After 
that, another sister became i entified 
with the organization as assistant sec- 
retary. In honor of the three sisters, 
the Emery fund has been established 
for the purpose of financing mission- 
aries at home on furlough, for board, 
medical care, study or recreation, The 
fund now amounts to $91,000. 

Miss Julia Emery lived to see the 
auxiliary grow from an organization 
in 1871 of 66 women, representing 
five dioceses, to a gathering in 1919 
of representative women from 92 dio- 
ceses an missionary districts 
throughout the world. She saw the 
annual gift of the woman’s auxiliary 
mount from $60,000, in the year 1872- 
1873, to $620,000 in the year 1918- 
1919. During the 50 years_of the ex- 
istence of the society, whose semi- 
centennial was celebrated last year, 
its annual gifts totalled $14,000,000

b HE CONFESSED! 


’- Pitzgerald, Ga., apa sid 17. = (fips 

% elal.)—After havi to testi- 
“fy for the state aides ie the case 
of Fred Stubbs, jointly indicted with 
_ 14 others for the murder of W. T. 

Reed, A., B. & A. engineer, 

io he would not corroborate a con- 
fession he is alleged to have made, 

0. C. Fairfield will be placed on trial 
Wednesday morning under one of the 
joint indictments. _ 

-: Fairfield’s action “Monday caused 
C4 BP one of the greatest surprises in court 
Bs coat here, when he refused to re- 
: og: the repo confession which | 
tk e is said to have given Solicitor-Gen- 

‘eral Wall, several grand juries and 
‘ Wether persons. 

Much delay was caused in- Stubb's 
trial on account of Fairfield’s alleged 
iliness, and when it became known 
Monday that he refused to corrobo- 

_ rate his alleged confession, in which 
@ implicated Stubbs and 12 others, 
the state closed without placing him. 
on the stand. 
Jury Deadlocked. 

- The jury in the Stubbs’ trial early 
tanight still was apparently hopeless- 
lydeadlocked, and a mistrial appeared 
likely. In his statement to the jery, 

. the defendant denied taking part in 
the shooting on the night of July ‘5, 
“which resulted in Reed’s death later 
in an Atlanta hospital. He attempted 

4 to prove he was elsewhere at the time 
| the shooting oceurred. The case went

Solicitor Wall attempted to place 
Fairfield on trial this afternoon. but 
the defendant announced to the court 
he was unable financially to employ 

unsel, and requested that McDonald

sent him.

The cases against the strikers, who 
reside at Manchester, are up for trial 
separately. ‘The first case called ‘was 

that against Stubbs, a locomotive en- 
 gineer, accused of ots i to in-

Reeves testified that Stubbs accosted 
him and asked: 

“Are you still scabbing?” and then 
remarked: “If you will come ont be- 
freer this store there will be one less 
scab.” 

The other evidence was corrobora- 
tive in its mesure. The state closed 
its case at noo 

The aceant took the stand and 
made a statement, in which he said 
that he asked Reeves how the latter 
was getting . along scabbing, that 
Reeves replied: “It is none of your 
business, but you can make it your 
business.” and he. the defendant, re- 
plied: “If vou come out here on the 
street, I will slap your face.” 

He asserted that it was nothin~ but 
a personal wordy altercation. and that 
he had “heard that Reeves had threat- 
ened to kill him if he ever got a 
chance. ; 

In rebuttal. the state offered two 
witnesses. who swore they overheard 
Stubbs tell his connsel, just before he 
went on the stand: 

“The only thing to it was that I just 
wanted to get him out behind the store 
and beat hell ont of him.”

at a meeting to be held early next

Byron C.. Kistner, retiring president ; , 
of the Atlanta Retail Food Dealers’ 
association, was presented with a thir- 
ty-second degree Masonic watch charm 
by members of the association Tuesday 


-night in the Chamber of Commerce 


building, following the installation of 
1922 officers, who are: J. H. Bul- 
loch, president ; George A. McGaughey, 
Morris Weinberg and Kk Maloney, 
vice ane aya We as in, treas- 
urer, and K. V. Bergen, secretary. 
The meeting was one of the largest 
the association has held and was fea- 
tured by an address on “System in 
the Retail Grocery Business,” by 
Samuel Zinkow, and the annual report 
of the secretary, Mr. Bergen. 

The report Satan te eg the work of 
the association’s special committee, 
which has been trying to devise ways 
and means of stopping the crimes 
which are being ‘perpetrated against 
retail grocers and méat dealers. ‘The 
report said that the committee will 
continue to work, but that crimes 
against the retailers are even more 
general than when the committee was 
appointed. es 
The report also spoke of the oppo- 
sition of the associatiOn to the emer- 
gency tax sponsored by the mayor, and 
the association recommended the pass- 
age of an eight to ten-million dollar 
bond issue. ‘The association was the 
first organized body to sponsor the 
bond issue which was favorably de- 
cided upon by the voters of Atlanta,” 
said the report. 

Municipal Market. 


The report also ref¢rred to the pro-| 
posed municipal market, declaring that 
the association offered to pay the cost 
ot a special election to determine 
whether or not the people of Atlanta 
want a municipal market. ‘The offer 
was not even considered,” says the 
report. 

fhe report also pointed out that 
the association has waged 4 campaign 
to have peddling regulations of the 
city enforced, has attempted to have 
vegetables sold by weight instead of 
measure, has launched a movement to 
have houses numbered uniformly with- 
in the city, has succeeded in causing 
the reduction of the,@ost of ice to 
merchants, has endeavored to protect

“TO CHARTER FOES 
& 


over $1,000,000 is wasted annually by

cilman Bdgar Watkins, author of the 
“Atlanta charter plan,” addressed the 
Kiwanis ‘club at its weekly luncheon. 
Tuesday and repiied to critics of his 
charter speech one weex ago before 
the Lions’ club. 


Residents of Birmingham pay $14. 438 
per capita each year for services ren- 
rded by the manicipality, while» At- 
lantans pay $20.61 per capita, and the 
difference in expense to the citizens 
of the two cities amounts 1m a year 
to $1,229,678, Mr. Watkins told the 
Kiwanians. 

“The finance committee epeclitiy: an- 
nounced publicly that 1t considered 
one of the city boards ignorant and 
incompetent, and took from the board 
the right to complete a pubiic build- 
ing then under construction because 
of the board’s inefficiency,” the coun- 
cilman said. 

“During the meeting 
Monday a man who has been a moem- 
ber of council for a number of years 
made the undenied statement that [ 
for ten years there has been an an- 
nual waste of $25,000 at the city pris 
op farm.” 

“If you want good city government 
don’t sit around and criticise,” he con- 
cluded. “The man who cusses his 
government and does not act to bet- 
ter it, is of little value vo the city.” 

Councilman Watkins will maxe two 
speeches Wednesday on his proposec 
city charter for Atlanta. The first 
address will bé made at tne reguiar 
meeting of the Masonic club at 12:50 
o'clock in the Peacock care. The 
Sunny City Four, a maie quartet,

- Basing our‘action on faith in the future when 
present abnormal conditions will have disappeared 
---and desiring to secure for the public a share in the 
efficiency of manufacture which public appreciation 
has enabled us to develop in all Victor manufacturing 
we desire to announce the f ollowing reductions in 
our list prices.

Records now listed at 85c 


Reduced to 75c 


12-inch Black Label, double faced 
Records now listed at $1.35 


Reduced to Sl 25 


These reductions in list prices together with lower 
prices on Red Seal Records announced some time 
ago---improvements in standard instrument types 
without increase in price and the introduction of new | 
models figured on anticipated normal conditions 
rather than on cost---puts the entire Victor line as 
a unit on a list price basis substantially lower than 
_at any time in the past and emphasizes again ‘the 
leadership of the Victor: in its ‘commercial field.

The budget bureau, likewise, has 
been abie to accomplish little in the 
direction of actual reorganization, al- 
though there bas beep much “co-vr-

law with the task of recommending

An examination of old files of the 
proceedings of. congress ‘will reveal 
that there was the same demand for 
executive reorganization after the civil 
war as that which followed the great 
war. Senators demanded that the 
“Augean stables’’ be cleaned, and that 
the hordes of federal officeholders be 
dismissed. But the agitation then 
died out without any drastic changes. 

There has been no. executive reor- 
ganization from the time of the birth

added, bureaus created, and independ- 
ent offices established as need urose, 
with little regard for system. And the 
old order persists.

changes that-will fail by the wayside:

first: Elow this is to be apportioned—never omitting

latter declared that no single public 

unprovement has done more for the 

general good of the country than the 

development of our highway system, 
Urges Co-operation. 

Colonel Bowlby told the congress 
that the advent and development of 
the American® Road Builders’ asso- 
ciation has- had much to do with 
making the industry what it is. He 
described its growth since organiza- 
tion in 1902 and asserted that the 
organization could be made the most 
potent influence in highway develop- 
ment in this country, if not in the 
world. The speaker also stressed 
the importance of co-operation by the 
association with -the United States 
bureau of public roads, the state high- 
way departments and the American 
association of state highway officiais. 

In discussing the growth in road 
building Colonel Bowlby asserted that 
it was now the principal industry in 
every. civilized country of the world. 
The United States, he pointed out, 
stands at the dawn of the greatest 
road building era of history. 

Atlantans Present.

mer chairman of the Fulton county 
board of commissioners and now a 
members of the publi- works com: 
mittee of that body, who is in at- 
tendance; ‘Tuesday inspected the va- 
rious .types of paving on exhibit at 
the colliseum. 

W. R. Neel, engineer of the Geor- 
gia state highway commission, stated 
that the Chicago convention is the 
largest road congress ever held in 
America and expressed the belief that 
1922 would bring about the greatest 
development of roads in the history 
of Georgia, both on account of the 
universal demand for permanent roads 
and the reduction in price of road 
building materials. 

Both Commissioner Etheridge and 
Mr. Neel stated that they were in 
favor of abolishing advertising signs 
along the highways in Georgia, after 
Colonel Bowlby had urged the mem- 
bers of the association to pledge 
themselves to use their best efforts to 
support legislation looking to the 
properly planned elimination of such 
unsightly and oft. times misleading 
advertisements on the road. 

Among those listed to speak are 
Professor Arthur H. Blanchard, pro- 
fessor of highway engineering 
highway transportation, University of 
Michigan, and American delegate to 
the international good roads congress 
at Madrid in 1923; Senator James H, 
MéDonald, of Contecticut ; Austin B.

CAN YOU BEAT IT? «& 
There is no more delicious arti- 
cle of diet than a genuine, “hick- 
ory smoked and molasses-cured” 
country ham—the type of ham that 
has made Brooks county famous. 
Such hams are always in de- 
mand, and eagerly sought after. 
And yet a thorough combing of 
the Atlanta markets, both whole- 


sale and retail, in a city that is 


_ central of a metropolitan district 


6f more than a quarter of a million 


of population, reveals the astound ? 


ing fact that not a single home- 
cured Georgia hamiis on sale here! 
The Constitution told the story 
yesterday. 
There are plenty of hams in our 
meat markets; there is no dearth 
of meat of any kind, but for the 
most part it is western meat, and 
the hams offered for sale are, in 
the main, hams made from hogs 
that were grown in the west or 
north, killed and prepared for mar- 
ket in western packing houses, and 
shipped to Georgia | for sale; 
Meanwhile our farmers are lying 
awake o’ nights trying to figure out 


si how. to’ beat the boll weevil and 


keep out of the clutches of the 
sheriff!

A 


GEORGIA’S BIG PROBLEM. 


In communicatjons . appearing 
els@where upon this page W. H. 
White, Jr., president of the White 
Provision company, and W. R. 
Crites, secretary of the Millen and 
Jenkins county chamber of com- 
merce, commenting upon our re- 
cent editorial on “The Home Prod- 
uct,” discuss most interestingly 
the proposition of finding a mar- 
ket for Georgia products. 

Commenting upon the remark- 
able report made by Mr. Crites | 
upon the astonishing number of 
articles of daily consumption in 
Georgia that we import from other 
states—to the production of every 


one of which Georgia is peculiarly 
adapted—and which report was, 


the basis’ of our “Home Product” 
editorial, Mr. White wonders— 

‘ig this report will be allowed to go 
on the files, with no action taken, 
@s have so many other reports 
which have been prepared by other 
chambers of commerce and made the 
issue of numberless meetings, and 
have filled the news and editorial 
columns of Georgia newspapers so 
prominently for the past several 
years.” 


“Is it not about time,” he per- 
tinently asks, “to let up -on” this 
everlasting cry of ‘no market’ for 
the products of the Georgia 
farmer?” 

The trouble is not that there its 
no market, but that the products 
of Georgia are not put upon the 
market and within reach of the 
demand! 

That fact is due not so much to 
any shortcoming on the part of 
the farmers—for all that the farm- 
ers can reasonably be expected to 
do is to produce—as to a lack of 
co-operation between farmers and 


 Dusinegs men and consumers. 


“It is not so much the lack of 
says Mr. 
White, “as it is simply a lack of 
co-operation.” 

And Mr. White says: 


“The Georgian himself/ can say 
whether or not there shall be a mar- 


= 


= “ ket for the products raised on our 
>. farms, or whether or not 


indus- 


tries that are uneertaking to de- 


iF - velop these markets shall have an

‘day too soon; and with it the as- 
surance of the’ police board that it 


conveyed by council, and that the 
new men will be sworn in and put 
\ to work immediately, will be gen- 
erally approved. 

The public will now look with 
full confidence to . the -police de- 
partment to put an end to the wave 
of crime in this city, and the po- 
lice department should be. given: 
the fullest measure of co-operc tion 
to that end. 

No police administration in At- 
lanta ever had a better opportu- 
nity than this department now bas 
to demonstrate its efficiency. 

There are many who believe 
that the trouble with the depart- 
ment is not due so much/to the 
insufficient number of men on ihe 
force, as to a lack of efficient ad-' 
ministration growing out of cum- 
bersome regulations and. political 
interference. 

The people are soon to be given 
an opportunity to see just what, 
if any, trouble there is on that 
score. 

Council has given the police 
board exactly the number of men 
asked for, at an additional cost. of 


$72,000 per year to the city. . » 
That will be the best investment 


the city ever made if it serves to 
put an end to this crime wave ard 
stops this riot. of burglary and 
thuggery. 

If, however, the fault lies in in- 
efficiency of administration, neith- 
er fifty nor one hundred and fifty 
additional men will solve the prob- 
lem until the system of administra- 
tion is. changed! 

Council is to bé@ warmly com- 
mended for so promptly respond- 
ing to the public demand in this 
instance. Let us hope that it will 
develop that this is the solution of 
the problem. 

It is the duty of every good 
citizen to co-operate with the po- 
lice department to that end. 


SPRING GARDEN PLANS. 


Springlike weather and seed cat- 
alogues have set the amateur gar: | 
deners dreaming of early plenty? 
for home tables—such as only the 
well-directed home egrden can sup 


though fickle February frowns so 
near, and there’s no telling but 
that it will “cut up” in the usual 
way and keep even this favored 
part of the country close to the 
home-fires. 


says the Albany (Ga.) Herald, with 
a confident forecast of garden- 
prosperity; and it sees visions, ang 
dreams dreams of— 

“Fat, sleek watermelons with 
firm, red meat; of cantaloupes that 
make us hungry and petulantly jm- 
patient ‘fér the coming’ of July: of 
turnips and lettuce, of beans and 
asparagus, of potatoes and onions, 
cf cabbage and cauliflower, of beets 
and cucumbers, of .peppers’ and 
fsquash. They make us forget all 
the discouragements of springs long 
past, and we are firmly resolved to 
raise some vegetables this year like 
those in the seed catalogues the 
morning mail brings us.” 


There’s joy in just thinking about 
it—from the Albany paper’s view: 
point, though the spring garden 
has its troubles and tribulations, 
for— ; 

“The neighborhood” pigeons and 
the neighborhood chickens will fly 
over. Somebody's cow will pay our 
garden.spot a midnight visit, and a 
stray dog will elect to bury a bone 
in our pet cantaloupe hill. The bugs 
and the beetles, the grubs and the 
moles, the scabs and the scales, the 
ants and the spiders, the wilt and 
the droop, the rust and the rot—all 
will come to enjoy our gardeh, while 
we buy vegetables from the man 
who rings his bell in front of the 
house every morning.” 7 


But the city gardener has dem- 
onstrated to his own and every- 
body else’s satisfaction that he 
can be as successful at the garden- 
ing business as his country com- 
petitor who brings the well-laden 
basket to his morning door. 

And if there is good gardening 
this year, it will not only* contrib 
ute to the health and pleasurable 
enjoyment of every community, 
but cut the cost of living, what- 
ever it may be, mt, as it has al- 
ways done. 

At any rate, it isn’ t too early 
to give thought to it—to lay plans 
for springtime and the seed-sow-. 
ing which may come to assis 
harvest.

LESSER. LIGHTS. 

From “The Merchant .of Venice,” 
Act Fifth. I take this dialog be- 
tween Portia and Nerissa: 
Portia—That light we see is burning 

in my hall. 

How far that little candle 
throws his beams! 

So shines a good deed in a 
naughty world. 


Nerissa—When the moon shone, we 
did not see the candle. 


Portia—So doth the greater glory dim 
the: less. 

A substitute shines brightly 
as a king 


his state 
Empties itself, as doth an 
island, brook 
Into the main of waters. 
~ it whieh makes this place in 
which we live a real world, is its les- 
ser lights. We would tire of a heavy- 
enly sky. with but a single moon en- 
jeweled within it. - 

if every man and woman in a town 
were famous and distinguished, there 
would be no one to point any of them 
out to the visitors. 

When you can but press a button 
and have electric lights flood their 
rays to every corner of your home, 
a candle in comparison seems worth- 
less and out of place. But let the 
electric wires gét out of order, a fuse 
be. burnt out, and your little candle 
takes its place in honor and serves 
well. 

Everyday folks will always be in 
the happy majority. ,.And thank’ 
for that, for He meant it that way. 

The lesser lights of life are far the 
most interesting—for nen people can 
understand and ap e them. 

And no matter wag any

ways remain but one medium of ex- 


pe feet.

Key to Market Problem Is Common Sense 
And Intelligent Action,SaysW.H.W hite, Jr. 


The Constitution: is in receipt of 
the two following communications, 
one from W. H. White, Jr., president 
of the White Provision company, At- 
lanta, and the other from W. K. 


chamber of commerce, relative to the 
farm produce marketing situation in 
Georgia, and with particular refer- 


this subject in The Constitution last 
Sunday. 

White Wonders If Still 

Nothing Is to Be Done. 

Editor’ Constitution: I have read 
with interest your editorial in Sun- 
day morning’s Constitution, under 
the caption, “The Home Product,” 
and your comments on the splendid 
and most timely report of W. R. 
Crites, of. the, Millen chamber of 
commerce. 

I wonder if this report wilt be al- 
lowed to go to the files, with no 
action taken, as have so many other 
reports which have been prepared 
by other chambers of commerce and 
made the issues of numberless meet~- 
ings and have filled the news and 
editorial columns of Georgia news- 
papers, s0 prominently for the past 
séveral years. 

Is it not about time to Jet up on 
this everlasting cry of “no market” 
for the products of the Georgia 
farmer? Why not face the subject 
like men and women and acknowl- 
edge that the Georgian, himself, can 


Psay whether or not there shall be a 


market for the products raised on 
our farms and whether or not the 
industries that are undertaking to 
develop these markets shall have an 


‘outlet for their product. 


The people of Georgia, themSelves, 
may say whether or not they will 
utilize the products of the Georgia 


farmer and operate their industries 
to capacity and keep employed the 
people of our state, or whether by 
their. action in buying, they shall 
keep employed the population of for- 
eign states, using foreign products 
and leave Georgia's industries idle 
and her labor unemployed. 


It is not so much the aod of mar- 


3 keting facilities, as it is simply a 


lack of co-operation. 

How long will Georgia stand the 
camouflage charge of inferior qual- 
ity of the hogs she produces, when 
it is known that the products from 


sold as the Smithfield ham. 
Today, if 


duced in America, he would demand 
and the hogs in Georgia would then 


in the United States. 
You see advertised, 


miles away. It reduires pork préd- 
sausage. 

There is not a Georgian within 
the boundary of the state who does 


not know that fresh pork products 
made from our own ‘Georgia hogs 
and manufactured in our own home 
cities are superior in quality and 
more fit for food than any sausage 
produced in any climate and under 
any conditions, thousands of miles 
away and shipped to the state of 
Georgia by freight and express. 

When you are buying sausage 
fram this far away state, you are 
taking bread and eat from fami- 
lies within this state, whose labor 
could be used in the manufactufe o 
as fine sausage as can be produce 
in the whole world and you would 
then have the benefit of good fresh 
product. 

This is not only true about meat, 
but is true with hundreds of other 
goods that are manufactured in the 
eity of Atlanta and other Georgia 
cities, whose raw product is grown 
on the farms within the state and 
whose employees &re people of your 
home town, supporting your banks 
and merchants and helping to keep 
up the industries and pr 
your own home state. 

This cry of “no market” for the 
Georgia farmers’ product and “round 
table discussions” of “means to re- 
lieve the unemployed” has been go- 
-ing on about long enough and it is 
time for men, who are real men, to

Crites, secretary of the Millen, Ga., 


ence to our editorial discussion of 


the hogs of the class that Georgia 
produces are bringing the highest 
price of any pork product produced 
in the United States, and I refer to 
the Virginia peanut hams, commonly 


the Georgia consumer 
was to demand the best meats pro- 


and receive Georgia grown meats 
bring a price equal to any produced 


fresh pork 
sausage from a point a thousand 


ucts and labor to manufacture pork 


say in terms which the people can 


lieve this situation and give to our 
people that which they produce — 


her prod- 
p her in- 
dustries in Seeration: and "web peo- 


There are business men who are 
render- poaking it see business to see ees 


gress of 


q 


’ 

and until enough men and citizens 
in Georgia become _ interested in 
overcoming the business of keeping 
Georgia products in disrepute with 
the consuming public there will 
never be a market for Georgia prod- 
ucts. 


Now then, a solution of this prob- 
lem requires only common sense 


thinking and intelligent action on 
the part of the people of this state. 

The tonsumer holds the key abso- 
lutely to the situation and can re- 
lieve the unemployment of this state 
and can market their own Georgla 
farm products through their own in- 
dustries, regardless of those so par- 
ticularly interested in the develop- 
ment of markets for the products of 
other states and the supporting of 


industries and employment of labor 
in the. far away states. 


I congratulate the Millen cham- 
ber of commerce and I congratelate 


the people of Georgia on having” 
mat who realize where ‘the’ trouble 


congratulate some of its men who 
will undertake the responsibility of 
actually assisting the farmers and 
the unemployed. 


W. H. WHITE, IJr., 
President White Provision Co. 
Atlanta, January 17, 1922. 


MillenCham ber of Commerce 
Thanks The Constitution 


Editor Constitution: I heg to 
thank you for the editorial relative 
to our chamber of commerce. We 
are trying to be of service not only 
to Millen but to the entire state; 
in fact, I have little use for the 
men in development work whose 
vision only takes in his own little 
vicinity. 

Georgia is one of the wonderful 


states in the union, and if we can 
get the people to thinkin we can 
accomplish a great deal. our pa- 
per is to be congratulated in its 
broad efforts to bring about this 
line of thought. 


That investigation I made was of 
actual condition of things in our 
stores here in Millen. The game 
applies to every town in the 
state, If Georgia were living 
off of her own products  to- 


day she would be prosperous, 
Instead we seem to make other 
states rich. This appliles not only to 
our agricultural life but to our min- 
eral resources. Last year it was 
my privilege to'be one of the offi- 
cial speakers on the Georgia Tech 
tour. At Cartersville, Ga., there 
were linea up fifteen’ trucks each 
laden with a different kind of min- 
eral. Cedartown made the state- 
ment they were shipping more iron 
ore than any other town in the 
state—but they were only shipping 
the ore. Not one smelter was to be 
be seen. There*were no plants of 
any kind converting these minerals 
into a finished product. oe the 
proper development in “circle 
drawn around the cities of Rome, 
Cartersville and Cedartown there 
should be a city the size of- Pitts- 
burg, teeming with activity. and 
bringing to the state a. new and 
greater wealth than ever before. 

The same thing is true of our ag- 
ricultural life. We have been too 
content with cotton and have falled 
to dévelop... Even if there were sec- 
tions that did ‘develop they would 
not go to the trouble of packing 
their products in a way that would 
compete with other sections and We 
fell behind in the race. 

These things must be pounded 
home and your paper is doing a 
great work in the effort to make 
Georgia see what lies before her. 
We are at the parting of the ways, 
between an old and a new Georgia, 
and the next fifty vears can make 
} more traditions in the way of devel- 
opment than any in the history of 
the. state. And in tnat change’! 
hope to be of service.

me repeat that the less clothing one 
wears in any season of the year, with 
regard for his personal comfort only, 
the more hygienic; arid even if one 
can have ony five, 10 or 20 min- 
utes, a day in nature’s garb, say 
while taking the daily keep well ex- 
ercises, why, that is always  bhy- 
gieniec, 


Personal cleanliness is by no means 
determined by the amount or fre- 
quency of soap and water appWed to 


the body. One who coddles himself 
with more clothing than comfort de- 
mands, even though he bathe daily 
with soap and water or water alone, 
is not so clean. most of the time as 
one who wears no excess of clothing, 
takes ain air bath daily and a water 
bath only occasionally. 

A whole lot of courageous folk 
spend energy taking cold morning 
baths, a fine enough practice in the 
way of moral self-discipline, and such 
discipline is especially good for the 
stout and indolent youth. It is not 
advisable for skinnny onés of any 
age, nor for persons of any build past 
middle age. In the winter time a 
cold air bath in the morning, taken 
while doing exercise, is preferable to 
either a shower or a plunge. 

Women who desire to keep a rosy 
complexion should be strangers to 
soap, except for the hands. The face 
may be cleaned by a sort of dry 
cleaning process, with good cold 
cream. 

Too much soap and\water, too fre- 
quent body washing, makes the skin 
dry and harsh and irritable and 
itchy, especially in the winter time and 
among persons of mature age. It is 
wrong to wash away the natural] skin 
oil, which keeps the healthy skin soft, 
clear and warm. A shower is always 
preferable to a tub hath, being more 


hygienic: but the shorter the bath 
the better.

BITS OF NEW YORK LIFE 


M’INTYRE 


New York, January 17.—Another 
striking figure in the life of Broad- 
way has ascended the starry trail. In 
the passing of Rennold Wolf, the 
great white way lost its most con- 
spicuous historian. He knew the the- 
ater, the night and cafe life as no 
other. He was a martyr to overwork, 
and for two years had been only a 
shell of his former self. 

I saw him three weeks before the 
end in the New Amsterdam theater | 
foyer. He was stooped and gaunt, and 
his speech, failing to co-ordinate with 
brilliant mind, came in _haltin 
phrases. For 16 years Rennold Wol 
reviewed4plays for The Morning Tele- 
graph. 

He ‘wrote ted plays in collaboration 
with Channing Pollock, who was with 
him when he died. He was the gole 
author of four plays and wrote'‘one 
edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, ‘aside 
from hundreds of vaudeville and mo- 
tion picture plays. 

Mr. Wolf was at his best, however, 
as an after-dinner speaker. He had a 
sublime sense of the ridiculous, and 
was a master at forensic flights. He 
was in his finest form ithe night of 
the dinner to Irvin Cobb about seven 
years ago. 

It was a dinner the like of which 
New York had never seen. The most 
brilliant minds in art, literature and 
law were there. Great speakers spoke 
and then Wolf was introduced. It 
was a speech that inspired two big 
metropolitan journals to print it ver- 
batim on their editorial pages. 

Rennold Wolf was not a part of the 
so-called gaiety of New York’s night 
life, He was merely a journalist, look- 
ing on. Most of the time he went to 
first nights with his’ white-haired 
mother. whom he always called his 
“sweetheart.” 

One of his best friends was J. Fred 


i price of a “flop” was 


Zimmerman, the theatrical producer, 
nme ‘oddly, he piltoried him every day 


in The Morning Telegraph as the Mod- 
ern Hercules. One of the last quipay 
he wrote read: 

“J. Fred Zimmerman came up frouf 
Philadelphia yesterday to attend the 
premiere of ‘Lightnin’,’” 

“Lightnin’” had closed its’ three 
years’ run some time ago and moved 
to Chicago. 


Jack Lait, who brought his type- 
writer: over from Chicago two years 
ago, believes that he is fast becomin 
a typical New Yorker. The elevator 
boys in his apartment are giving him 
tips on the horse races. He ‘also finds 
himself saying “boid”’ for bird. How- 
ever, he has far to go; He must learn, 
ted to put the nickel in the new sub- 

slots and procure a little red book 
compile the secret telephone num- 
bern of a -bootlegger,,a straw bonds- 
man, a loan shark, a blonde, an East 

Side gorilla and a lawyer to watch th# 
whole outfit. By that time he wif 
be ready to sneer at Chicago. 

’ Times have changed on the Bowery. 
The 10-cent lodging house is backg 
During the war and thereafter the 
25 cents, Mit- 
ten Heck’s, the Alcazar, Oscar’s,: the 
Poindexter and Abel Cohen’s have Ke- 
duced their prices. There is an eche 
of hard times on this brooding, sullen 
street. The casual laborers look just 
a bit more seedy and the overcoats 
they wore last winter are missing, The 


-cheap rooms are simply large square 


boxes, open .at the top except for 
wire grating, with a small door in one 
side and containing a narrow cot, stool 
and tiny lécker. The suite. de luxe 
is always 30 cents. It has a regular 
hed, a chair and a looking glass. Ig 
the evening the guests sit in the din . 
lit office looking out upon the wide 
stretches of the Bowery. ey resent

Poor, dear Unele Bim has spent

Therefore, allow me, not by re-

to take care of Uncle Bim.

President W. O. Foote said Tues- 
day that numerous inquiries from oth- 
er cities relative to establishing busi- 
ness and manufactufing branches in 
Atlanta have been received since the 
first of the year, and it can be reason- 
ably inferred that business conditions 
throughout the country are becoming 
better. Frank Weldon said that 
umong the inquiries was one from a 
furniture concern, of Grand Rapids, 
Mich., a cap manufacturing concern, 
of New York, and an awning concern, 
of Michigan. He also said that a com-

Variety Promised 
By Emory Songsters 
In Appearance Here 


Something unusual in the line of 
variety skits will be presented by 
the Emory University Glee club Fri- 
day night at the Wesley Memorial au- 
vitorium in its famous “Rag-Time 
Court” scene. This laughable bur- 
lesgue gives the audience an insight 
into the little comedies and tragedies 
of life -which are enacted almost eyery 
day in the courts of a large city. It 
has proven one of the most popular 
numbers in the repertoire of the club 
for this season. 

Another decidedly humorous musical 
number given by the Emory singers is 
“Grand Opera Up to Date.” The in- 
ttrumental interludes, played by the 
Emory university concert orchestra, 
include selections from “Faust,” “Tl 
Trovgtore” and other popular operas. 

Tidkets for the performance are now 
on sale at Wesley Memorial church 
and at Cable Piano company.

|HUNDREDSCH EERED 
FORMER PRESIDENT 


a 

That Woodrow Wilson has come 
into his own, after a period in which 
some would have taken him frem the 
lofty position which he has been given 
by the American people, is evidenced 
by the testimony of E. Walter Trippe, 
formerly connected with the. Atlanta 
branch of the internal revenue depart- 
ment, lately returned from Washing- 
tom. Mr. Trippe described Monday 


‘night how the throng in the national 


| 


capital greeted the former president 
with cheers as he spoke from his 
porch Sunday afternoon in response to 
the ovation given him. 


7 
“Tt was Friday or Saturday. that 


I first noticed the people of the city 
placarding automobiles and street cars 
with Wilson posters,” said Mr. 
Trippe. “On Sunday afternoon the 
.| people gathered at the National thea- 
ter, one of the JArgest theaters in 
Washington, to celebrate Rally day, 
beginning the week in which the 
Woodrow Wilson foundation fund is 
to’ be raised. , 

“After the parade through the 
streets of Washington, ‘headed by 
Samuel Gompers, head of the Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor, the crowd 
gathered at Mr. Wilson’s home to 
listen once more to the words of the 
great. American. Wilson looked well. 
He appeared to be in better health 
than whe has experiénced in a long 
time.” 

Mr. Trippe went to Washington last 
Tuesday on.business and returned 
Monday afternoon. He figures promi- 


{nently as a prospectivé candidate in 


the coming race for congress, to take 
place in the early part of the summer.

by United States Judge W. I. Grubb 
to pay a fine of $500 and serve four

Saphire was the principal govern- 
ment witness. His testimony devel- 
apes that he and Deputy United States 

rshal 8. A. Smith arrested Cefalu 
at a residence on Capitol ‘avenue early 
last fall, after Cefalu had delivered 
two quart bottles, supposedly contain- 
ing whisky, to Saphire. 

Plan to Trick Saphire. 
Cefalu told the court that when 
Saphire telephoned him for two quarts 
he recognized the agent’s voice, and, 


[s suspecting a trap, went to his brother- 


in-law’s grocery and secured two 
quarts of vinegar, and took it and de- 
livered it as whisky, so as to trick 
the officer, | | 

Hal Lindsay, assistant. ~- United 
States district attorney, prosecuting 
the case, pointed out that when Cefalu 
was arrested he waived preliminary 
hearing and expressed a wish to — 
a plea of guilty at an early date, an 
that not one time did he claim that 
the bottles contained vinegar until his 
case was called Tuesday.

when a boulder, marking the historic 
spof where Wheeler's cavalry met the 
union forces during the battle of At- 
lanta in the war between the states, 
will be unveiled. 

The boulder was erected by the 
Agnes Lee chapter, United Duaghters 
ot the Confederacy. The .. move- 
ment to mark the site of the battle 
was: carried out by a memorial com-

dents of Agnes Scott college, members 
of the United Daughters of the Con- 
federacy and others will take part in 

the ceremonies. 


Lindsay pointed out, and called atten- 
tion to the fact that the man is still 
out of jail. and has never served a 
jail sentence. _He told the jury that 
Cefalu is wealthy, and that a fine 
means little. 

Deliberates Two Minutes. 


The jury deliberated for about two 
minutes, and returned a verdict of 
guilty. 

Some time next week another liquor- 
selling case will be called against Cef- 
alu in federal court. Mr. Lindsay 
said Tuesday that if the conviction of 
Tuesday is sustained, a conviction in 
the second liquor-selling case’ may 
carry a sentence in the penitentiary. 

A hearing on the Cefalu motion for 
a new trial will be held Saturday. He 
is at liberty under $1,000 bond. He 
is represented by W. Paul Carpenter 
and Walter Sims.

Atlanta Women. Spontaneous | Voters League 


w Wilson Faith 


The rallying of woman’s faith to 
the Woodrow Wilson foundation has 
been shining light in the two days’. 
progress of Atlanta’s campaign. \ 

Women versed in public work, and 
women whose activities are known 


only to those who come into direct 


association with them in their work; 
the experienced club woman, the re- 
tiring church worker, the business 
woman with’ little leisure for cam- 
yeigning—all have come forward. 

They haye given of their money, 
and more significant still, they have 
stationed themselves downtown to re- 
ceive subscriptions. Finally when 
asked tO express themselves through 
the press, they have not had to study 
what they would say. 

So keen is their feeling, that ex- 
pression is spontaneous, A few are 
quoted as follows: 

“It is not just g memorial to Wood- 
row Wilson which the American peo- 
ple have the opportunity to establish 
this week in the Woodrow Wilson 
foundation; and it is not the fund 
which is the important thing. But 
what is really significant is the ex- 
pression which people’s contributions 
will mean of their belief that broth- 
erly love and peace is rwssible in 
place of strife and war.” 

Mrs. Inman Enthusiastic. 


The speaker was Mrs. Henry A. 
Inman. Receiving contributions down- 
town during Wilson hour on Monday, 
she is continuing her effort .with a 
conviction in her own miind of the 
scope and meaning of the work which 
is making the people think with whom 
she comes in eontacr, and is adding 


‘ to the fund she is daily turning into 


headquarters. 
“Tt is numbers that is needed in 


. contributions to.the fund,” Mrs. In- 
* man emphasizes.

; 


: 


“The world is watching us closely 
this week, more closely than we our- 
selves realize, and if the American peo- 
ple in great numbers express in con- 
crete form their belief in the possi- 
bilities of Mr. Wilson’s so-called ideal- 
ism, it will be an encouragement to 
all the world. 

“It is not just. a league of nations 
which we will thus profess to believ in, 
but nations which can livé together 
in peace and mutual understanding, in 
place of suspicion and strife.” 

An Educational Purpose. 

Miss Laura Smith believes that 
while the accusation may be true that 
Woodrow Wilson’s head was in the 
clouds of idealism, yet his feet are 
on the solid earth of practical possi- 
bilities, 

“T think women are showing a far- 
sighted wisdom,” said Miss Smith, “in 
their faith in the Wilson ideals and 
their enthusiasm over the foundation. 
They see the economic as well as the 
idealistic purpose, in his principles. 


“When we have international friendship 


end permanent peace, then, and only 
then, can the revenues of our nation, 
and all nations, go into the construc- 
tive channels. Education, in -its 
broadest aspect, will have a cnance, 


The money that is now going in the 


ways of destruction will be diverted to 
, @ proper use, and that proportion, 93 
~ per cent of our own revenues for in- 


struments of war, 7 per cent for in- 


‘struments of peace, will be no longer 
-an embarrassment to the term civili- 
‘gation. 


= 


“The foundation itself 1s primarily 
educational, since its purpose is to 


reward, and thus to exploit, the vir- 


tue of peace and the yalor of the peace- 


anaker. 

“These are some of the reasons why 
women are regarding it as a real.priv- 
jlege to contribute to the Woodrow 
Wileon foundation and to work for it.” 

Victory Over Defeat. 


The expression of Mrs. William A. 


Wright dates her patriotism as ad 


back as the confederacy, and has seen 


the apparent defeat and the victory 


j 


ek Secs aes’ ce ames 


figure in history. 

“Aspociated in my mind for months,” 

s Mrs. Wright, “has been the con- 
f , Jefferson Davis, and the 
world war, Woodrow Wilson. 

“In the annals of history I can re- 
call no man who has suffered as these 
two suffered for others. The monu- 
ment which the confederate veterans, 
aided i the southern people, are’to- 
day building at Fairview, Ky., in hon- 
or of Jefferson Davis, cannot gladden 
his heart. But this monument, the 
Woodrow Wilson foundation, will give 
happiness to Woodrow Wilson, glad- 
dening a heart which has been bowed 
down in sorrow for others. Let us 
go forward in this great work, never 
lagging for a moment.” . 

° Women’s Faith. 

“It is a gioriops thing,’ said Mrs. 
Bolling Jones, “that the world’s great- 
est statesman, once so reproached, is 
coming into his own. Livoyd George, 
I consider, is the only other man in 
Weodrow Wilson’s category. The 
whole world is coming round to the 
Woodrow Wilson principles, even 
those who do not admit it. “he women 
have had the faith ail along, and have 
kept it. Il am glad to see that they 
are showing their light.” 

_ Miss Florence Downs, division cash- 
ier, traffic department, American Tel- 
ephone and Telegraph company, has 
been one of the most efficient workers 
among the group of women just quot- 

iss Downs’ confidence in Wood- 
row Wilson’s principles and his poli- 
cies has concrete expression in two 
books which she has compiled, which 
are made up of clippings from news- 
papers, magazines and books on Wood- 
row Wilson and his work, while presi- 
dent of the United States. 

At her station in the Fourth Na- 
tional Bank building, during Wood- 
row Wilson hour alone, $300 or $400 
was brought to her by acquaintances 
who knew her consistent admiration 
for Mr. Wilson,. and had seen her 
books : : 

Asked for a statement concerning 


her consistent admiration for Wood-| 


row Wilson and what he atands for, 
Miss Downs said: 

“The establishment of a Woodrow 
Wilson foundation, which is uppermost 
in the minds and hearts of the Ameri- 
can people this week, calls for the ex- 
pressed gratitude of a grateful peo- 
ple, who believe in and cherish the 
ideals and life effort of Woodrow Wil- 
son to make the world safe for 
racy. The generations are yet unborn 
which will arise and call him blessed, 
as history records the mighty thought 
of.loving service he has given—not to 
the chosen few, but to the world at 
large, that it might realize its free- 
dom from bondage.” 

Flowers to the Living. 

Mrs. Robert T. Daniel said: “This 
is a fitting memorial to a man who 
still lives, and who, as the years go 
by, will be more and more understood. 
I am glad I live in an age when we 
delight to place immortals at the feet 
of, the living, and to record history 
while he still smiles and understands 
the sincerity of purpose back of the 
effort beitig made to have a Wood- 
row Wilson foundation memorial.” 

“Contributions so far recefyed  to- 
wards the Woodrow Wilson fonnda- 
tion,” said Mrs. T.-T. - : 


man of the woman’s 


satiefactory when it is rea 

hundreds gave in small sums, and that 
people were expected to bring their 
money to headquarters, voluntarily, al- 
though they have been trained to have 
soliciting committees come to them. 

“The women have proved in splen- 
did fashion their belief in the founda- 
tion movement, and they are working 
earnestl#.”’

+ Methodist Women Called 


For Hospital Equipment 


More than 55,000 women, which 
includes every Methodist woman in 
the North and South Georgia confer- 
ences, are to be enrolled during the 
next few weeks in the greatest church 
organization the south has ever 
known, if plans mature as launched 
at an enthusiastic meeting of. the 
Woman’s Auxiliary of the Wesley Me- 
morial Hospital, held in Wesley Me 
morial church Tuesday afternoon. 

Every woman in the church is to 
be given an opportunity to enroll and; 
by doing so, have a part in equipping 
the great new Wesley Memorial hos- 
pital now being constriicted on the 
Kimory university campus. 

Every ‘church is to compete against 
every other church for memership; 
every district against every other dis- 
trict. The sentiment as expressed 
at the meeting Tuesday is that the 
auxiliary be made such a potent fac- 
tor that no Methodist woman can 
overlook an opportunity to join. 


Mrs. Arkwright Presides. 

The meeting Tuesday, which was 
presided over by Mrs. 
wright, chairman of the central com- 
mittee, was one of the most enthusias- 
tic gatherings Atlanta has ever known. 
It developed, among other things, that 
the equipment of the new hospital is 
absolutely dependent upon the wom- 
an’s auxiliary and that, through nomi- 
nal contributions on the part of every 
woman, it will be possible not only 
to furnish the necessary equipment, 
but also, from year to year, pay for 
bed linen and pantry necessi-

Preston Ark: | 


on the response of the women, 

It was pointed out by Mrs. Ark- 
wright and other enthusiastic work- 
ers that the hospital offers women an 
unexcelled opportunity to be of service 
to humanity, and that the member- 
ship fee of $1 is so small that every- 
one can join without hardship. It 
is expected, of course, that many 
women will welcome, the chance to 
contribute more than the _ actual 
amount of dues. : 

Pending the completion of organi- 
zation in the various conference dis- 
tricts of Georgia, all Methodist wom- 
en are urged to display their interest 
by sending their memberships to Mrs, 
Preston Arkwright. It is imperative 
that all who can do so enroll at once. 
The hospital is being finished paney 
and the demand for equipment, linen 
and pantry supplies is urgent.~ All 
women who are willing to help in any 
way are urged to do so promptly.

committee and is assisted b rs.

EVEN THINGS NEED A REST SOMETIMES 


What wonders a little change will | 
dé in making one see the familiar 
thing with a new eye! Here is a 


I have just started again to carry a. 
small traveling bag which I put on 
the shelf some years ago. I had car- 
ried the bag then for some years, and 
it bad reached that stage when it 
seemed to me too shabby and out of 
date to carry any longer. Sol bought 


beautiful to me then because it was 
new. 

Now I have worn out that bag, and 
before buying a new one I looked over 
the old one which I bad placed on the 
shelf and decided that it really didn’t 
look half bad-.after all. So I had it 
freshened up a bit and have started 
earrying it again. And I really feel 


quite satisfied with it. And yet I re- 
member that when I put it away and 
bought the new one, it seented to me 
that I would rather stay at home 
than go on a journey with that eld 
thing again. 

The Rest Did That Bag a Lot of Good. 

Evidently its long rest on the shelf 
in the back of my closet did that bag 
a lot of good, by proxy. That is, it 
rested my eyes and made them see a 
different bag from the one they put 
away. 

A friend of mine says the same 
thing often happens to her with a hat 
or a suit. She puts it away in the 
spring with the feeling that she can- 
not possibly wear it again. Then she 
wears something different all summer, 
and when she turns from a summer 
hat or suit of which she has gotten

about-town. Canby invites Jeanne to 
a dinner together with 

Mrs. Adele Parkinson, a widow and 
former flame of his. At dinner she 
meets 

Vie Barstowe, heir to the reported 
millions, who shows signs of infatua- 
tion with her. 


Signor Bonnicetti, a famous violin- 
ist, asks only to serve Jeanne, and 
she uses him as a drawing card to 
her tea party. 

Adele foils Victor Barstowe’s at- 
tempt to linger for a tete-a-tete with 
Jeanne, 


As Jeanne is starting for a dinner 
engagement, Henry rrison . tele- 
phones. | 

He informs Jeanne that he can bor- 
row nothing on her worthless —_ 

Selby North, gossiping, elderly 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barstowe’s 
many flirtations. 


Harrison comes to breakfast to ar- 


and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents bim asa business ac- 
quaintance, 


cay offers a “market tip” as a 
meahs for Jeanne to make some 
money. 

She arranges the party so that 
she drives to the forbes’ in Bar- 
stowe’s car and Jeanne goes ahead 
with a man named Farnbam. 

At the dance that night Jeanne 
using indifference to bait Barstowe, 
succeeds in a him. 

She learns that Vera is a formid- 
able rival, being a lifelong acquaint- 
ance much favored by Barstowe’s 
‘family because of he. blue-blooded 
ancestry. 

She. consents to dine with the Bar- 
stowe’s, to whom Vic presents her as. 
his fiancee. 

i But she meets with a chilly recep- 
ion. 


Installment No. 29. 


: Climbing a Pedestal. 

Vera Dayton’s expression when she 
heard Victor Barstowe address Jeanne 
as “darling” was indescribable. 

Her glance flashed, lightning-like, 
first to Jeanne, then back to Bar- 
stowe again. But neither of the young 
people showed the slightest perturba- 
tion or embarrassment. It was op- 
viously not a slip of the tongue, Vera 
decided. Barstowe had actually meant 
to address Jeanne. affectionately, and 
she received it as one long accustomed 
to such phrases. 

Barstowe gave no evidence of noting 
Vera's amazement. He bent over 
Jeanne, 

“Dad wants to-show you his col- 
lection. May I take you to him?” 


murmured excuse to Vera Dayton, 
moved away on Barstowe’s arm. 

“You mustn’t let Dad monopolize 
you or tire you,” laughed Vic. “He’s 
nutty on the ver ay of his collection, 
and you’re a darling to + him. 
It’s the direct road to Dad heart,” 
he added. 

Jeanne smiled, but made no com- 
ment. Neither of them made any ret- 
erence to the Barstowe family’s re- 
ception of the news of their engage- 
ment. Jeanne felt that it would be 
undignified for her to admit that she 
had noted the decided coldness, and 
she was confident that Vic would res- 
pect her pride too much to open the 
subject. 

When inevitably the time arrived 
for such a discussion, she had deter- 
mined to take — in quiet dignity, 
not unmixed with hateur. Sbe would 
give the impression that the objec- 
tions of the Barstowe family were 
humiliating to her family pride and 
breeding, and trust to luck that this 
attitude would disarm them of any 
suspicion that she was a_ fortune 
hunter. . 

She spent more than an hour in 
Barstowe, senior’s, study, inspecting 
the. marvelous collections, listening 
with flattering attention to his ex- 
pansive discourse on subjects dear to 
his heart. he knew that she was 
winning that quarter, but Bar- 
stowe’s mother presented the unknown

When the time arrived for Vie to

with just the right shade of formality. 


“So sglad you could come,” mur- 
mured the older woman politely, her 
cold gray eyes absolutely devoid of ex- 
pression. “Gvod night!” 


No mention of another meeting, no 
reference to the engagement! Mere- 
ly. the formal s ing of a chance 
guest ! 


There were angry tears in Jeanne’s 
eyes as she got into the limousine for 
the return trip to town. 


It was the first time in het adven- 
turous career since she had come to 
New York that she had met with a de- 
liberate rebuff. Until that night, no 
one had snubbed her. And to think 
that, of all people, the first to do so 
should be the mother of her fiance! 


She bit her lip to keep back the 
tears as the car made its way through 
the park and out of the grateway into 
the motor highway. She was deter- 
mined that Vic should not guess her 
humiliation. She felt somehow that 
it would lower her in his eyes if she 
admitted that she had been routed. 
If she could remain serenely indiffer- 
ent to the affront put upon her by his 
mother, she would have supremacy, 
and his attitude would be one of re- 
sentment toward his parent. 


She knew now why she had not 
been snubbed before. . . . It 
was because she had been clever 
enough to play her game with men 
and not with women. Men were blind- 
ed by her beauty and charm, and men 
are charitable, usually. The women 
she met. were those to whom she was 
presented by the men who had accept- 
ed her. Had they dared to snub her. 
appearing unheralded and unvouched 
for, they would have lost favor with 
the men whose attentions they courted. 


“Tired, dear?” 

Barstowe drew her to his side, bend- 
ing his head to look into her eyes. 

She averted them, lest the glimmer 
of tears be visible in the light that 
illuminated the car occasionally as 
they flashed along the road. 


“A little,” she admitted. “I’ve had 
a busy dgy. . . But it was a 
charming party, wasn’t it? What a 
regal mother you have, and your fa- 
ther is a perfect dear! I was ever so 
interested in his splendid collections!” 


Barstowe laughed with a note of re- 
lief. She wondered if he had feared 


cool reception. 

“Oh, the family’s all right! A lit- 
tle stiff until you get to know them. 
If dad’s hobby is prints, mother’s is 
ancestry. She’s spent thousands on 
the family tree, of which she knows 
each twig and acorn, and she belongs 
to every club in the country which 
pours incense on the musty relics of 
antiquity.” 

“Are you an ancestor fan, too?” 
inquired Jeanne. 

‘Lord, no!” he laughed. “I think 
| most family closets need fumigation 

instead of cultivation.” 

“[ wonder if your mother would 
be interested in my family tree?” 
mused Jeanne. “Like you, I never give 
a thought to my ancestors, but I had 
soine who figured rather prominently 
in the early history of this country.” 

He took her up eagerly. 

“I say, that’s great! You must talk 
to mother about them. She'll be en- 
thusiastic. Can’t you manage to lunch 
with us tomorrow? Mother's coming 
in to town, and I asked her to meet 
me at the Ritz. 

Jeanne was too clever to rush mat- 
ters. Besides, she needed time to 
ry that family tree until it should 

e acceptable to Mrs. Barstowe’s crit- 
ical gaze. She believed it would be 
wisest to call in the services of an 
expert genealogist, in view of the older 
woman's knowledge of such matters. 

“Thank you, but I couldn’t possibly 
make it,” she declined Barstowe’s in- 
vitation. “I have a busy day tomor- 
row. So sorry/ Please present my 
apologies to your mother.” 

“But I want you to go with me 
to Tiffany’s tomorrow about the ring,” 
he insisted, “and you don’t suppose 
for one instant that I am going to let 
the a go by without seeing you, do 


She shook her head, smilingly. 

“Some other day will do for the 
ring. Remember, I said that I would 
not marry you if your family objected,

“But I shall!” he insisted confident- 
ly. “Of course, it was rather a facer 
springing it on them that way to- 
night. But oul) see. They’s come 
across all right !” 

Jeanne’s smile was doubtful, and 
Barstowe suddenly reached over and 
drew her into his arms, crushing her 
against his breast.

in the world would make any differ-

Atlanta Artist 
Paints Portrait. 
Of Art Authority 


A distinction of real significance 
coming to an Atlanta woman was the 
selection by Mrs. Rose V. 8. Berry, 


national recognition, of Miss Kate Ed- 
wards, an Atlanta artist, to do her 
portrait. 

Because of Mrs. Berry's office as 


arts of the General Federation of 
Women’s Clubs, and because of her 
work as a professional lecturer and 


teacher, it is necessary that her por- 
trait should frequently appear in mag- 
azines and newspapers, as a part of 
the publicity of the genera] federation, 
and of Mrs. Berry’s professional work. 

“I have been looking for the kind 
of a portrait which would be a like- 
ness,” said Mrs. Berry, during her re- 
cent visit in Atlanta, “and which 
would be pleasing enough in the char- 
acter of the portrait itself to be of 
value in publicity. I think I have 
found it here in Atlanta, in your Miss 
Edwards’ white pastels, It seems to 
me a most expressive portraiture, and 
I like the medium. * 

“I have found that-the pastel pho- 
tographs successfully, too, and that is 
a practical detail which is no incon- 
siderable item in the use to which I 
would put the portrait.” 

Mrs. Berry, who had expected to 
end her week-end visit on Sunday, re- 
mained over Monday in order to give 
Miss Edwards a sitting, and so sym- 
pathetic a subject did Mrs. Berry 
prove, that the artist was enabled to 
complete the portrait at ohce, and it 
was a finished product by Tuesday.

of the ad is that it’s quite true. We 
all seem to take our teeth for granted 
until a toothache or a receding gum

It’s also probably true, as another 
widely printed ad declares, that a 
clean tooth never decays. This means 
that the teeth should be brushed 
twice every day in such a ma@yner as 
to take the film from them and fo get 
out every particle of food that hides 
between them. The teeth should be

DRESS 


BY ANNE RITTENHOUSE 


The Knitted Garments for Spring 
Provide Much of the Gossip — 
Those Who Are Busy Buying 
Making Things to Wear on _ the 
Winter Vacation and America, Al- 
| tho Slow to Respond to This 
Fashion, Has Seen Its Importance. 


1 It was not possible for England and 
France to keep placing importance 
upon the new kind of knitted clothes 
their smart women were wearing with- 
out the trade in America finally tak- 
ing notice and trying to bring to these 
shores the dashing apparel that Amer- 
icans desired. It is a temptation to 
ask why the knitted overblouses and 
tailored suits were not sooner made a 
feature of our exhibitions here. ‘here 
must be a good trade reason, but when 
one has to answer that question ev- 
ery day, one would like to know what 
to answer. The thin blouse, beaded 
or braided, or finished with dangling 
ends or balls was offered by shops 
whenever one asked for overblouses. 
In the specialty shops where individ- 
ual blouses were built to order there 
were many models in heavy crepe 
without ornamentation, except for a 
group of pin tucks, or the dash of 
embroidery on the end of a string gir- 
die pla at the sides only, but. the 
ogo! elastic sport jumper, the kind 
of thing one bought in Wurope tor 
the last year, was lacking. Possibly 
this spring the situation will be 
changed, for the early exhibitions in- 
clude French knitted suits and skirts 
with jumper blouses. As early as 
the first week in December the ex- 
pensive dressmakers were showing 
these costumes for Palm Beach, Geor-

| THE GRAND OLD DOGS | 


“Wouldn’t you hate to be a traveler, 
lost in the snow on a night like this?” 
shivered Clyde. 

“You bet,” agreed Mills. “I was 
just reading about how in the old days 
travelers used to get lost in the Swiss 
Alps and the monks from the monas- 
tery of St. Bernard used to go out 
with their big St. Bernard dogs and 
find these lost wanderers and bring 
them in to the warm, safe. monastery. 
The dogs would find the way.” ; 

“I’ve heard a lot about those dogs,” 
said Clyde. “Wish we had one. It’s 
a shame so many of them were killed 
off when they were used as Red Cross 


dogs in the war.” 
Mills nodded. “People don’t appre- 
ciate those fine dogs, and they don't 


raise them so much any more, because 
they aren’t very -popular as show- 
dogs. They’re the biggest dogs in the 
world. For hundreds of yearg the 
monks bred them especially for their 
intelligence, strength and working 
qualities.” ’ | 
“Last summer,” said Clyae, “2 no- 
ticed a family down at the beach that 
had one to guard their children. The 
St. Bernards are great water dogs, 
you know. This vid fellow was a 
regular nursemaid for those kids. He’d 
chase after them and run with them 
just like a regular human being.” 
“They're brave dogs, too,” added 
Millis, “but they’re not fighters. I 
hope they ,on’t disappear. I guess 
those travelers in thes nowstorms on. 
the mountains never dreamed that 
some day we might neglect those 
‘grand old dogs.’” —_ 


THE MOTHER OF IT 


Little mem Warthog has.a most 
unlovely face, 

His eyes are much too tiny, and he’s 
lacking style and grace;, 

He has an ugly kind of snout, his 
teeth are out of place— 

And yet I'll bet his mother thinks for 
looks he sets the pace. 


Felix Hippo has d@ mug that’s—well, 
let’s call it plain; 

He has a monstrous body and a very 
little brain, 

And when. his mouth is opened up, 
onlookers get a paii— 

And yet I'll bet his mother thinks he’s 
handsome, in the main. 


George Gorilla’s claim to looks is 
really very small; 

His chin slopes out, his forehead in, 
his neck’s built like a wall; 

He drags his hands upon the ground; 
he’s wider than he’s tall— 

And yet I'll bet his mother thinks his 
beauty beats them all. 


Bill Giraffe, you must admit, is hardly 
made to scale— 

Too much proportion in his neck, too 
little in his tail; 

He has such silly little horns, as orna- 
ments they fail— 

And yet I'll bet his mother thinks 
that William is a whale. 


Kilmer Camel is a beast that gets no 
beauty prize; 

He has a hump, an ugly mouth, and 
wicked little eyes; ' 

He has a funny, rolling gait; he utters 

| squealy cries—— 

And yet I'll bet his mother lauds her 
offspring to the skies. 


Nels Muskox gets his funny tooks 
from his paternal side; 

He has a very clumpsy walk, and un- 
attractive hide; 

When Nature made him all the laws 
of beauty she defiei— 

And yet I'll bet his mother views her 
son with glowing pride.

He jerked his gun up and fired. not

at a great distance, the scream of Sally 
from the door, and then liquid fire 
spurted from the lamp across the table, 
wipped in a flare to tite ceiling, and 
licked against the walls. 

Anthony, scarcely believing that he 
was still alive, rushed for the door, 
with .a ery ringing in his ears from a 
voice beyond the room. One man in all

“Halt!” he yelled. 

But the other rushed on. Calamity 
whipped down her gun and fired, but 
even before the trigger was pulled Ben 
was sagging toward the floor, for Bard

A figure ran around the edgé of the

“Stand clear of me, Sally,” he mnt-

is a man’s work.” 

“The work of a pack of cayotes!”

“They’s no harm intended him, on

he’se got to do is give up ‘his gun—and

“Ts that all?” said Sally. scornfully. 

“Don’t follow me, Sally,” said Bard;

inte Proves Too Good | 


BY FV aLY WOODRUF F 


—- ats ie. reer as ites 


$$ * 


s For Opp osition 


for passing away that science knows. 


Colonel Doonan is suffering from a 
complaint that was known by Jim 
Jeffries and is now being felt by Jack 
Dempsey. He has a basketball team 
that is-actually too good. This isn’t 
any casting: of bouquets. It is the 
recital of a pitifully true and sorrow- 
ful fact. . 

The Atlanta Athletic club has noth- 
ing, on its schedule capable of giving 
it a. run for its money and the worst 
of it is—the club can get nothing on 
its playing list of the de- 
sired capabilities. I actually believe 
that if some basketball team would 
: ring mp from somewhere and ‘beat 

e tar lights out of Scrappy Sullivan 
and company, Al would weep for joy. 

For here’s the rub: “The club has 

to have competition of a serious na- 
ture to put it in shape to make a real 
showing when the big National A. 
A. U. tournament is played late in 
the s 5 e-club can’t get in 
shape playing teams that don’t 
- threaten for five seconds from gong 
. to gong. It’s 7 eget and psycho- 
. . logieally - impossible. 
And the club is banking heavily on 
doing .things at the tournament this 
year. It did things last year when 
Johnny Westmoreland led his five into 
the semi-finals, only to be nosed out. 
This year the club is grim and deter- 
inined to go all the way—but it has 
to have opposition to get there. — 

And there’s no opposition. 


PLENTY OF COMPETITION 
IN TOURNAMENT. 


However, Atlanta is certain to see 
all sorts of vivid basketball when the 
S. I. C. and S. I. A. A. joint tourna- 
ment is held at the Auditorium dur- 


the latter part of F . The 
going was spirited enough and uncer- 
tain énough last year with hair- 
breadth finishes and all manner of 
clashes between ancient rivals and 
so on. 

But last year’s battling won't be a 
circumstance to this year’s. Accord- 
ing to present indications every team 
that participated last year will par- 
ticipate this year, and in addition to 
those quintets there will be large re- 
inforcements from the big schools in 
Virginia and the Carolinas \and such 
added starters are L. S. U., Vander- 
bilt and Centre college. 

list simply means that 


| from, the wey ee tournament opens 


basketball will -be played ‘every min- 


}ute from jocund morn to dewy eve, 


and far into the stygian night. 

Last season, the Kentucky Blue- 
birds came down and took the title 
right out of the hands of Georgia, the 
favorite. is season, Georgia’s five 
doesn't seem so formidable, while 
Kentucky is apparently just as good. 
But that means. little. 

For instance, Coach Aleaxnder, who 
has seen ’em play, says that when 
the Virginia colleges drift down here 
we will get new, startling, but alto- 
gether definite ideas about how the 
game should be played. 


BY ALL MEANS HIRE 
SCOTT CHESTNUTT. 


Unofficial advices are to the effect 
that President Martin, of the South- 
ern league, is making strenuous ef- 
forts to get Scott Chestnutt to throw 
away the startling garb he has affected 
as a movie salesman to return to the 
blue and breast-pad and mask of an 
umpire. 

By all means hire Scott. There is 
no question about his competency as 
an umpire, but if he is only, allowed 
to officiate in his motion picture 
clothes, he will be able to relieve a 
baseball season of something of its 
taste of tediousness, which is no mean 
achievement in itself. 


Yellow Jackets Have Fine Chanch 
To Even Accounts With Baptists |: 


~ Game Friday Night at the 
’ Auditorium Is Certain 
to Be Hard-Fought 
Affair. 


BY JOHN STATON. 


The Tech. varsity seems to be get- 
ting its sea legs after the jolt in 
‘Tuscaloosa. To get beat, that’s nat- 
ural. To get beat and come back 
stronger than before, that’s divine. 
Ihe team is not at all discouraged, 
and is preparing to do to the next 
one what was done to them. 

And in this case it happens to 
be Mercer, for Tech meets the Bap- 
tists in. Atlanta Friday night. The 
game will be played at the Audito- 
rium. It happened just right, too, 
for Tech owes Mercer a licking to 
even up things. And she will have 
a glorious chance Friday night, for 
it is said about Mercer that they play 
a good deal better in their own back- 
yard than anywhere else. Which 
fact is true for most basketball teams. 
So it is that Tech ought to have the 

advantage. Now if we.can only use 
it and beat Mercer, we will start the 
home season off right. You know it’s 
much better to win games at home 
than anywhere else. Therc’s so much 
appreciation you know. 


Mostly Local Boys. 

Looking overt the personnel of the 
varsity at the present ‘writing, one is 
surrpised to find that all the players 
with the exception of one are from 
Atlanta. Jimmy Brewster is the “‘fur- 
riner.”’” Newnan, I believe, is the 
name of the town which Brewster, 
Amis; Carpenter and company made 
famous. KEckford, the center, play- 
ed for two years on the Marist team 
in the Prep league. The other three 
are from the same school, Boys’ High, 
of Atlanta. 

Baby Roane and Emery Jenks 
played on the same team at Boys’ 
High, and so did Emery and Al 
Staton. Since Al was two years 
ahead of Baby they never got to play 
together in high school. On the var- 
sity and squads together, there are 
seven Boys’ High men: Al Staton,- 
Satt Staton, Baby Roane, Emery 
Jenks, Kenneth Matheson, Oscar Da- 
vis, Henry Granger and Muggsey 
Smith. Not such a bad representa- | 
tion from one. school. Pe 


Baseball Start. 


Kid Clay has announced his in- | 
tentions of starting baseball prac- 
tice early in February. He wants 
to get off to a good start, it seems. 
Even now he has a number of his 
men out warming up, ranning a lit- 
tle, heaving a few easy ones, and get- 
ting limbered up. ~Sunshine”’ and 
“Sox,” “Red,” “Wenie,” Andy and 
a bunch of them are gradually get- 
ting into condition. 

To be true it is almost imperative 
that Tech get off to an early start 
if she is .going through with the 
schedule mapped out. It is the most 
comprehensive baseball schedule that 
the Tech team, has ever attempted. 
Ilarvard, Navy, Georgetown and a 
raft of big timber must be met and 
defeated. To do that the team must 
be in shape. It is most’ too soon to 
do any’ predicting, but it looks like 
Kid’s first job is to mold an infield. 
Flowers and Webb will be missing 
from the old guard. There is talk 
that “Sox” will be brought into firet 
base, but you never can tell.

DRAUGHON TO 


MEET GORDON 


The Draughon’s Business college 
girls’ basketball five will make their 
initial trip of the season Friday, when 
they journey down to play the Gordon 
institute girls Friday afternoon. 

The Draughon team has played sey- 
eral games up to date and has been 
victorious in each contest, but reports 
from Barnesville are to the effect that 
the locals will meet a stumbling block 
in the Gordon co-eds. 

Gordon has been noted:in prep cir- 
cles for its athletic teams, but now 
they come forth with a girls’ team 
that plays basketball. The players on 
the Gordon co-ed team have. been 
playing together for two years. They 
ave n “working hard the past two 
weeks in preparation for the game 
with the business. college five Friday 
afternoon. 

Those players that will make the 


| trip with Coach Joe Bean are: Misses 


Phillips, ‘Condon and Barcroft, for- 
wards; Gannon, center, Wilson, Walk- 
er and Minor, guards, and Cole, gen- 
eral utility. 


Sport Happenings 
From Every Clime 


New York, January 17 intiadleitieed 
the growth ‘of basketball as a pro- 
fessional sport in the east, it is re- 
liably reported that Johnny Beckman, 
forward of the champion original Cel- 
tics, has been receiving $12,000 for 
a season of six months. Beckman’s 
pay ‘has been cut to $9,000, according 
to basketball promoters, because he 
and other stars ‘were too heavy for 
the box office to carry. 


The tiniest fighters in the ring are 
to meet in bouts on a fight t card now 
being arranged in London, the _sport- 
ing life of London reports. The new- 
est and smallest class is called the 
gnatweight division, for scrappers un- 
der the flyweight figure of 110 pounds. 


Irish Emil Meusel : and Johnny Raw- 
lings, of the New York Giants, re- 
ported to be playing winter league 
baseball in California, are believed to 
be beyond any discipline by Judge 
Landis such as was imposed on Babe 
Ruth, and Emil Meusel’s brother, Bob. 
A study of the anti-barnstorming rule 
under which the two Yankee stars 
were punished, discloses unquestiona- 
bly that Emil Meusel and Rawlings 
are within their rights, according to 
attaches of the Giants’ offices. This 
rule forbids members of championship 
clubs from barnstorming “during the 
year in which the world’s champion- 
ship was decided.’ The Yanks-Giants 
series was last y% 


Johnny Wilson, middleweight cham- 
pion, has had his hearing before: the 
ew York state athletic commission. 
And, he still’ &tands suspended for 
smashing his contract with Tex Rick- 
ard to box Harry Greb to a decision 
with the title at stake. 

Marty Kililea,:manager of Wilson, 
appeared for Johnny before the com- 
mission. ‘The verdict, delivered T'ues- 
day, was that Johnny can not box 
in this state ~amtil he agrees to go 
through with .the Greb. fight. Kil- 


ilea ‘said he would not box under that/S 


contract, as a matter of as but 
would go on with the fight under a 
new set of articles. The Sriginal con- 
traet, he claimed, was forced upon 
Wilson. 


Benny Kauff, the famous Giants’ 
outfielder, suspended last spring by 
Judge Landis, because of his indict- 
ment in connection with an antomo- 
bile theft, of which charge he was 
later acquitted by a jury, has lost a 
court fi t to compel ndis to rein- 
state him in professional baseball. Jus- 
tice Whitaker,@s,the supreme court, 
denied Kauff’s oalitinn. for an. injunc- 
tion against Landis to restrain him 
from interfering with Benny’s pursuit 
of his calling. 

The court held that Kauff has no 
contract with the: Giants any more. 
He did have a contract for 1921. but 
that has expired. On the other hand, 
the Giants retain an option on” Ben 
ny’s services, which they are unable

Boys’ High is just that much better | 


than the Gordon team. - 
The Boys’ High five played the. best 
— game they have ever played. 
eir passes were as- swift as light- |. 
ning and very accurate, the majority 
of times. O’Dwyer at forward is the 
best basketball passer in the amateur 
circles in and around: Atlanta. He | 
always passes to his mates-in such a 
way that the opposing guard ‘is left 
looking all around him for the ball.

Captain Tom Slate, of the’ Boys’ | 
High five, was again the star of the 
game, with his. long goal‘shooting. Tom 
seldom goes into a game without get- 
ting at least three or four long shots. 
He takes very few chances at scor- 
ing, but when he does try two points 


| are generally recorded for Boys’ High. 


Little Matheson also played a 
game at forward during the first half, 
scoring three field goals. The guarding 
of Gibbs for Boys’ High was one of 
the features from the defensive side 
of the game. 

The Gordon team started off well, 
keeping the score tied until it was 
five-all, when the Boys* High team, 
by some beautiful passing and long 
goal shooting, pulled away, never to 
be overtaken. The Gordon team seemed 
to lack the confidence and teamwork 
in’ both parts of the game. 

Visiting Stars.. 

Wade and Cox played the best game 
for the losers. Wade scored six 
points, while Cox scored five. Cox 
and Huie were substituted for Gor- 
don near. the close of ‘the first half, 
and the Gordon team played a much 
better game from then on. They helped 
put confidenee into the team. The 
passing of the Gordon team was very 


inaccurate, especially in the first half. 


Boys’ High used the five-man de- 
fensive system, and Gordon had dif- 
fi¢ulty in breaking through it.

YALE COMING 
DOWN IN APRIL 


Macon, Ga., January 17.— (Spe- | 
cial.)—The Yale baseball team will 
arrive in Macon almost three weeks 
later this spring than was the case 
last year, pitching camp here April 
10. The reason assigned is that Yale 
must do her spring training during 
the Easter holidays, and Easter varies 
so much that the postponement is 
necessary. 

The full schedule for Yale while 
in the south is not ready, but at least 
eight games will be played in this 
city. One game is scheduled with 
Mercer for April 17. Indications are 
that Old Eli will lock horns with Au- 
burn, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Ten- 
nessee, and others. 

According to the present ae 
Yale will follow the Columbus Amer- 
ican association team in training 
here. The Columbus team will ar- 
rive March 14. and will be gone a 
week or more before the college team 
puts in an appearance. 


FULTON FIVES 
LOSE TWICE 


BY JESS WALTON. 

The Decatur High school girls de- 
feated the Fulton girls yesterday aft- 
ernoon in the first game of a double- 
header on the Decatur court, but the 
score of 30 to 8. The Decature girls 
completely outplayed thei Fultonites 
throughout the game, and at no time 
did the visitors show real basketball 
skill, the green material ‘telling on 
the Whitehall street girls. 

The features of the game were the 
playing of Mary Cunningham at left 
forward for the winners, she playing, 
an all-round game, shooting 15 points. 
Martha Ehle also played a good game. 
She ran the rims for a total of 8 
counters. For Fulton Brown played 
the best game, shooting the whole 8 
points made by her team. Miss Ter- 
rell also played good at guard. 

A shot just as the whistle blew in 
the boys’ game, proved the downfall 
for the Fulton boys. The score until 
this time was 18 all. A Fulton boy 
then made a beautiful shot from the 
center of the court, but Referee 
Matheny claimed that the ball should 
be tossed up on the sideline and 
Walker shot the basket. The game 
ended with the score 15 to 13.

Leo Flynn, of cou course, came in for |

It is not fair to blame Flynn. He 
is a good hustler, a smart man, and 
he saw a chance. He got contro! of

Baseball Tide 
Has Turned. 


The. tide in baseball has turned 
again, and the player-manager is com- 
ing back. With Speaker, Cobb and 
Killefer already playing managers, 
now comes Clyde Milan to take charge 
at Washington. 

The idea that a manager of a ball 
team should be on the ench is as 
old as Ned Hanlon and Frank BSelee, 
both great managers in the estimation 
of the public, and neither very great 
in the estimation of their players. in 
fact, Hanlon’s players ran his team, 
with him as judge, and Herman Long 
largely ran the Boston club for Selee, 
with Selee acting as advisory head of 
the team and handling it more off 
than on the field. 

The era of playing managers 
brought the best epoch of baseball, 
considered from a playing standpoint. 
Chance, Clark, Carrigan, and others; 
all playing managers, came along and 
won, while the bench managers, save 
Connie Mack,.made little success. ‘he 
claim of the owners that the strain 
of managing and playing -was entirely 
too much for any man led to the era 
of bench managers. Playing man- 
agers practically ceased to exist. Now 
they are coming back, and it is prob- 
able that, for the next decade at least, 
the managers will be players actively 
at work with their teams. 

The theory that no man can stand 
the strain of both playing and man- 
aging has two sides. Both Fred Clark 
and Frank Chance have told me that 
the strain of managing from the bench 
was harder upon them than managing 
when they were playin This ap- 
plied to their cases, of cOurse, as men 
who have played actively fret and 


‘gab: under enforced Jack of action, ; 


nd find real relief in active playing. 
Men who have not played, however, do 
not feel this desire for physica: action 
so much. 

There is no doubt that the manager 
who is out there on the field can 
keep in closer touch with his men, 
direct their movements more inteélli- 
gently and do better than he could 
sth on the bench. Chance, for in- 
stance, was a great manager when 
he was playing first base. His strong- 
est point was his ability to direct 
pitchers and to detect the instant they 
started to weaken. Fred Clark, in 
the outfield could watch pitchers and 
direct their movements, often causing 
irritating delays by running in to tell 
them what to do. 

On the bench neither Chance nor 
Clark could handle a team as well, 
nor gcould.they see what was tran- 
spiring. 

The worst feature of modern base- 
ball has heen the attempts of. man- 
agers to direct the entire game from 
the bench. As a matter of fact, the 
teams would have done better had 
they permitted the press box experts 
to direct the game from the press box. 
The idea, carried to the ridiculous nth, 
would be to have telephones installed 
to tell players what to do. We used 
to make fun of one manager who was 
reputed ‘to give a signal to a base 
runner while he was stealing, telling 
him whether to slide feet first or head 
first. But it is only an exaggeration 
of what has come to pass. ‘The re- 
turn to the player-manager system is 
a big step toward restoring the sport.

BENNY KAUFF 


LOSES SUIT(: 


Shover, 
Crisler, 9 


New York, January 17.—Benny 
Kaufé, suspended Giant outfielder, to- 
day was denied by Supreme Court Jus- 
tice Whitaker an injunction restrain- 
ing the National Exhibition company 
—the Giant owners—and J udge Ken- 
esaw Landis from continuing his sus- 
pension from professional baseball. 

Justice Whitaker held that there 
were no grounds for an injunction, 
since Kauff’s contract with the Giants 
expired last October, “While, the pa- 
pers show that*an apparent injustice 
has been done the plaintiff, this court 


is without power to grant the relief io £2. 


he asks,” the decision said. 

Kauff was suspended by Judge Tan- 
dis, following his appearance in court 
in connection with the sale of a stolen 
automobile. He was acquitted, but 
has never been restored, to duty with 
the Giants, Counsel for the Giants 
recently announced the club would be 
glad to get Kauff’s services if Judge 
Landis’ ban on him were removed. 


PETREL FIVE

Two of Atlanta’s college freshmen 
basketball teams will be in action this 
afternoon against prep teams of the 
City league. ‘The Oglethorpe fresh- 
men play the G. M. A. five on the 
Boys’ High court at 3 o’clock, and the 
Tech freshmen play the University 
Bluebirds on the Tech court on North 
avenue. 

The ao freshmen five has played 
one game, that with the Agoga team, 
ahd which was wom by the Agoga 
five. The freshmem"had been practic- 
ing only a few s, but now they 
are ready to take om any of the ama- 
teur teams of the sity for practice 
games. The’ game this afternoon 
should be fast be interesting. 

Coach Bean has been working with 
the. Bluebird fiye for the past few 
weeks in hopes of moulding a team 
that will stand along with the others 
of the prep league. ey are working 
hard for the game tis afternoon and

ketBa eas 
tres’ First Year 

This is "he first year that ‘the Ogle- 
thorpe freshmen have. endeavored to 
turn out a basketball team, but from 
reports circulating around the city the 
team that represents the freshmen of 
Oglethorpe is one that will give a good 
account of itself in any battle on the 
court. Gordy, former Tech High star, 
is running the guards a hot race for / 
one of the places. 

The G. M. A. Cadet team is playing 
its second game of the year and 
Burbage is doing everything in his 
power to develop a winning team. 


| 273 YARDS AVERAGED 
BY HALL:‘IN SLAGTOWN 
GOLF EXHIBITION 


| 


Birmingham, Ala., January 17.— 


(Special.)—Charlie Hall, professional | < 


at the Birmingham Country club, is 
the longest driver in the world, ac- 
cording to George*R. Jacobus, Ridge- 
wood, N. J., professional, who has a 
record of 372 yards, 

“I have either seen or 
against the longest drivers in the 
game, and I want to say that Char- 
lie Hall will outdrive any golfer .in 
America or England,” said. Jacobus, 
after his match with Hall. “They 
consider me a long driver up east,” 
continued Jacobus, “but I want to say 
that Charlie can outdrive me any- 
where from 25 to 30 yards on the 
average when I am at. my .best. Ted 
Ray, Abe Mitchell, George Duncan, 
Johnny Golden and Bob McDonald 
are regarded as the far-hitting pro- 
fessionals, and with all due fespeet 
to these great drivers, I am willing’ 
to back up my belief that Hall will’ 
outclass them in a driving: contest. I) 
have never seen his equal: 
tribute his wonderful driving to hisi 
grip, back stroke and. timing. . He 


is not a large man, weighing less : 


than 155 pounds. 


.“We have heard little off Hall as! . 


a long driver up east, but I was told, 
before coming south that I would find: 


a wonderful driver in -Birmimgham'}2 


named Hall, and to look*him up. They: 
never would stop talking about his’ 
driving around New York. Think of; 
‘a man averaging a little less than 
_yards on 23 drives.’ He wrecks 
“game, because when you oe to 
with him, he gets 
and then it is easy. 
complained of pressing whet he olen 
ed Hall here.’ . 

Jacobus, who is wintering in An- 
niston, will return to Birmingham in 
February to take lessons in driving 
from Charlie. Hall suggested to Ja- 
cobus after the match that he ag

ORCHESTRA OF MORRIS 
BROWN GIVES CONCERT 


The Morris Brown orchestra, 
which is made up of students of that 
institution, under the direction of 
Professor W. C, Thomas, gave a con- 
cert at the Auditorium theater on Au- 
burn avenue last night. This was the 
initial appearance of this musical or- 
ganization before the public. 

“The New Ye ™ cats Hall; the 
“Flower Song,” oo “A ple 
Blossoms,” by a, and the “Sex- 
tette from Lusia,” were given in such 
a fashion that would do credit to any 
organization of musicians. Other fea- 
tures of the program deserving spe- 
cial mention were soprano solo, 
“Springtime,” by Friedland, sung by 
Carrie Smith, member of the faculty 
of Morris Brown university, and 
“Goodbye,” by Tosti, sung by Gladys 
Freeland, one of the students of the | 
university.

Wallace Reid. 


(At the Howard) 

Maybe you wouldn’t take the ap- 
proach of rent day as philosophical- 
ly and easily as Wallace Reid does, 
and with empty pockets, in “Rent 
Free,” which is playing at the How- 
ard theater all this week, but Wally | 
gets into severa: situations which 
are enviable. Supported by Lila 
Lee and a strong cast throughout, 
Wallace Reid furnishes a series of 
laughs and thrills that commend the 
picture as one Which furnishes real 
relaxation. 

The Howard theater orchestra 
scores heavily with selections from 
“The Chocolate Soldier,” and audi- 
ences are receiving well the sextet 
from “Lucia,” especially arranged 
for six- brass pieces by Harry 
Hughes, of the Howard theater or- 
chestra. 

“The Beggar Maid,” a dramatic 
picture, has a etrong appeal, and is 
being well received, Howard News 
and Views carry such ,topics as al- 
ways please a discriminating au- 
dience, 


“The Three Musketeers.” 


(At the Forsyth) 

“The Three Musketeers,” featur- 
ing Douglas Fairbanks, playing at 
the Forsyth theater all this week. 

Douglas Fairbanks does the great- 
est work of his career. Those who 
have read the famous Dumas’ novel 
from which it was taken will ,be.de- 
lighted to see their hero, D’Artag- 
nan, match wits with the cunning 
Richelieu and crush through the 
cardinal’s seemingly insurmountable 
barriers. The intrigues of a mon- 


archy are laid bare in this thrilling 4 


tale.

with a zest that made it seem it was a 
new story. 

It was a new story to the jury, 
for they have all sworn that they did 
not follow the case, that they are not 
“Fatty Fans,” and that they know 
nothing of his alleged bohemian ac- 
tivities. 

Following the opening statement, 
the state called Dr. Sheiby Strange, 
autopsy physician, and Dr. Arthur 
Beardslie, house physician of the St. 
Francis hotel, where the party was 
held. 

They told of treating Miss Rappe 
and of her physical condition.

Decatur, Ga., January’ “17.—(Spe- 
cial.)—At an enthusiastic ee of 
DeKalb county business men 
farmers held at the courthouse tonight 
initiah. steps toward organizing suit- 
able market facilities for diversified 

immediate sec- 


Ramspeck was elected 
chairman of the meeting, which was 
axealy attended, and ad were 

de by leaders of the movement. 
Fred T. Bridges, of the state bureau 
of markets, spoke on the importance 
of providing an outlet for the county’s 
product the methods followed by 
the state department in aiding organ- 
ization: 

The progress DeKalb has made in 
the dairying and truck farming indus- 
tries was discussed, and suggestions 
made toward improving and lessening 
the cost of transportation and mar- 
keting. Decatur already has a curb

nery and feed mill near the city to

country. Construction of a potato 
warehouse also was considered. After 
further investigation, the leaders of 
the movement will make a definite 
decision relative to the new plants. 


Fourteenth Annual 
“Warman” Dinner 


Sets New Record 


The fourteenth dnnual “Warman” 
dinner, held Tuesday night in the 
grillroom of the Piedmont hotel, was 
probably the most pronounced success 
of any of these unique events,’ which 
have become established features in 
the commercial world of Atlanta. 

Each January, for 14 years, J. L. 
Waratan, city salesman for the Ragan- 
Malone company, has been host to At- 
lanta merchants and their buyers, and 
from the 16 who enjoyed the first din- 
ner given, the number has steadily in- 
creased, the gathering of Tuesday night 
setting a new high record with an 
attendance of more than 150 guests. 

In past years the event has usually 
been noted ‘for the speakers of national 
reputation in the business world who 
addressed the meeting after the dinner 
had been served, but this year it was 

a “homefolks” affair from start to -fin- 
ish, with the exception of a short talk 
by Lew Cody, the beau eetintanel of 
the sereen, who is appearing in person 
this week at the Metropolitan theater, 
and who livened things up for the 
group of Atlanta business pushers pres- 
ent 


Colonel Fred J. Paxon acted 
toastmaster ahd Fred Houser had 
charge of the singing. 

President Walter O. Foote, of the 
chamber of commerce; W. H. Brittain 
and Press.Huddleston were the main 
speakers, while short talks were made 
by James J. Ragan and Mr. Warman. 
Optimism was the keynote of the eve- 


as 


ning and that Atlanta has its fight- 


ing clothes on for 1922 was the only 
conclusion possible, if the spirit which 
prevailed could be taken as an indica- 
tion of what those present had upper- 
most in their minds 

Atlanta’s message to the world, and 
this is what the Warman dinner has 
come to mean to those who look to 
this city for an expression of the best 
business minds of this section. is one 
of hope and confidence for 1922. The 
“Atlanta spirit” was in evidence in 
every speech and on every face and 
with the splendid faith that is in him, 
the host issued a general invitation for 
the fifteenth dinner, which will be held 
in January, 1923. 


MOB IN FLORIDA 
LYNCHES NEGRO; 
ALLEGED SLAYER 


Mayo, Fla., January 17.—A mob of 
approximately 1,000 persons  over- 
powered officials here today, took a 
negro who, it is charged, killed W. R. 
Taylor Saturday night, and lynched 
him on the outskirts of the town. 

The lynching came on the third day 
of a countywide man-hunt, after the 
negro had been captured in the woods 
a few miles from town. News of the 
capture spread rapidly and before of- 
ficers could get him to jail he was 
taken from them by the mob, hanged 
to a tree and his body riddled with 
bullets. . 

Taylor, the son of a well-known na- 
val stores operator, was shot and kill- 
ed late Saturday night when he en- 
tered the negro’s home to —e 
a quarrel.

ential republicans of this section of

Minstrels 
“Big Hit Opening Night! 


The little swing of ies song, the | 
spontaneous effervescence of repartee 
really humorous and jokes that were 
really new, the jingling of tambourines 
intermingling with smooth, har- 
monious cadence’ or crashing flour- 


ishes of an exceptionally good orcies- 
tra, the blending of gay pie colorful 
costumes, with stage settings in the 

n of which taste and a sense of 
theatrical effect were really apparent 
—all these blended into a performance 
which brought for the Shrine Min- 
strels a smashing success upon their 
first night at “oe Auditorium Tues- 
| day evening. The Shriners will tonight 
stage a second “ange shngpeer © which, if 
comparable to the first, will not soon 
be forgotten by the pleasure seekers of 
Atlanta. 

Scenic effects of especial henley 
were produced with the appearance of 
Miss Annie Mae Coleman, as the Ha- 
waiian belle, in connection with the 
Hawaiian melody sung by Paul 
Crutchfield, and which was deserved- 
ly encored. No less meritorious was 
the assistance given by Mrs. Orris 

. Brown, in the song, “Budding 
Rose,” by Clarence Wall. As the wee 
bride and groom, who walked arm in 
arm across the stage as ©. F. yon Gun- 
ton made one of the hits of the eve- 
ning in his song, “Here Comes the 
Bride,” little Richard Tinkham, Jr., 
and Lois Spear are deserving of espe- 
cial mention. 

Light Comedy Throughout. 

The spice of light comedy was in- 
terjected throughout the entire enter- 
tainment by such acting as was per- 
formed in connection with the rendi- 
tion of the song, “Read ’Em_ and 
Weep,” in which burnt-cork artists 
joined with J. Thomas Hoffman in 
rolling grotesquely-huge “galloping 
ivories” before an audience which lit- 


erally held its sides im merriment. And, 
to the delight of the packed house, 
Bayne Gibson and Wylie West gave 
an exhibition of burnt-cork artistry 
which was really different, and truly 
meritorious. 

The opening number, in which the 
nobles assembled at “Shrine head- 
quarters,” and sang “Hail! 7 ie 
with all the’punch and swing it de- 
served was a true indicatton of the 
rich entertainment which followed. 
It was, perhaps, noteworthy that an 
incident ewacted at Shrine headquar- 
ter of a noble pleading over the tele- 


phone with his better half to permit 
him to remain for just one hour more, 
then half an hour, then fifteen min- 
utes, and finally replacing the re- 
eeiver, donning his hat and coat and 
dejectedly passing from tne gay com- 
pany, was met with applause which 
denoted a peculiar appeat to at least 
a large number of the audience. 


The Battle of Buckhead. 


“The Battle of Buckhead,” in which 
W. F. Lukiesh and Dr. C. N. Hughes, 
and American officer and his orderly, 
participated, was enacted with a skill 
which denoted real talent. The act 
was received with the appreciation de- 
served by Mr. Luckiesh and Dr. 
Hughes. 


“In a Bower of Roses,” was an epi- 
sode arranged with an eye to costume 
effects rarely found in a performance 
given by “home talent,” a description, 
incidentally, not required as an apol- 
ogy. The end men and the balladists 
performed with all the skill which 
those who witnessed. previous Shrine 
minstrels justly expected. The work 
of H.-R. Romans and Billie Haas 
as end men was especially meritorious, 
and the performance of the others very 
good. 

A criticism of the first night's per- 
formance would be incomplete, as it 
would be unjust, were the singing of 
Paul Crutchfield not to be described 
as having exerted a particularly com- 
pelling appeal to the audience. This 
appeal was seen in repeated encores, 
to which Mr. Crutchfield responded. 

John Mullin exhibited a vocal com- 
mand and ability in execution, in his 
solo, “Big Bass Viol,” which must 
at once have been the envy and the 
despair of many of Atlanta‘s aspirants 
to fame in this field of music. 


Skill in Direction. 


The artistry of the players in the 
minstrels would not have carried 
its full force, and elicited its full meas- 
ure of appreciation, save for the skill 
ir direction exhibited by Its producer, 
Perrin G. Somers, Jr. The perform- 
ance of the orchestra, under the di- 
rection of Dr. C. E. Buchanan, could 
hardly be spoken of in too commenda- 
tory terms. Altogether, the Shrine 
minstrels met with a success which 
was assured at once by the skill of 
its participants, and. the technique of 
its production.

BETTER SCHOOLS 
FOR COLORED 
RACE PLANNED 


Macon, Ga., January 17.—(Spe- 
cial.)—A large number of prominent 
Georgia educators and church workers 


met at Mulberry Street Methodist 
church here today to formulate the 
program of the Georgia committee ‘on | 
race relations, and incidentally to re- 
duce or wipe out illiteracy in Geor- 
gia. Judge Samuel Adams, of Sa- 
vannah, presided at the morning $es- 
sion, and Dr. M. Ashby Jones, of At- 
lanta, at the afternoon session, 

The committee on women’s work, 
through their chairman, Mrs. 
Lawton, of Savannah, reported sub- 
stantial progress in their plans to bet- 
ter race relations by enlisting the aid 
of women’s organizations in improv- 
ing eolored homes, churches and 
schools. The women have formed spe- 
cial subcommittees to work on each 
of these topics, and the chairmen of 
these committees reported for their 
groups. 

Rev. R. H. Singleton, pastor of 
the Big Bethel A. M. B. churchy told 
of the great trust that the colored 
people have in the southern white wen 
on the commission of race relations. 
He stated that the commission has 
done wonders in fostering better race 
relations. He said that his people 
do not want to meet southerners so- 
cially, but that they do need to re- 
ceive advice and aid from them in 
their churches, schools and home con- 
ditions. 

The state committee authorized a 
subcommittee on education to co-op- 
erate with the state department of 
education and the local school author- 
ities in bettering colored schools. 

A subcommittee on church co-op- 
eration was authorized, to co-operate 
with the white denominations, aiding 
them to influence colored churches 
and Sunday schools. 

Walter B. Hill, of the Georgia de- 
partment of education, discussed sev- 
eral phases of the educational prob- 
lem. He cited the last report of Su- 
perintendent M. L. Brittain, showing 
that in educatio me ge standing Georgia 
ranks forty-third among the states. 
Georgia’s low rafik is due in part, 
he continued, to the inadequate fa- 
cilities provided for negro children. 
Mr. Hill gave an account of the ru- 
ral school building program being car- 
ried on with the aid of the Rosen- 
wald fund. The commission decided 
to hold its next meeting in Atlanta in 
November.

practiced law in Atlanta; that his 
father was a Presbyterian minister 
in Augusta; that he married a Sa- 
vannah girl; besides being offered the

sity of Georgia.

Macon, Ga., Tahir 17.—(Spe- 
ciai.}—Accused of slaying his brother- 
in-law, Eimer P. Jones, J. M. Davis 
went on trial in the criminal branch 
of Bibb superior court this afternoon,

opposite him at the counsel table, and

after the first venire of 38-had sup- 
plied but nine jurors, the next yenire 
of 12 had furnished two and the third 
group, of 12, had supplied the 
twelfth member of ag murder panel.

the night of December 19, Davis sur- 
rendered at the Bibb county jail, 
where he explained that he shot in de- 
feyse of himself and his home. Mem- 
bers of both families testified at the 
coroner’s inquest that bad feeling had 
existed between Davis and Jones for 
some time, and that they prevailed on 
Jones, who was’ much smaller than 
Davis, not to visit the Davis home on 
the night he was fatally wounded. 

The hearing of testimony will begin 
this morning, with Solicitor-General 
Charles H. Garrett being assisted by 
Attorney Walter Defore. Turpin & 
Lane represent the defendant. Judge

[Bachman Again Heade 
Atlanta Commercial Body 


. At the annual meeting of ‘stockholders of the Atlanta Commercial 
Exchange in headquarters in the Trust Company of Georgia building 
Tuesday afternoon, the chief subject under discussion was the need 
of broader markets in Atlanta and Georgia: Annual reports of officials 
were read and all officers of last year, headed by J. R. Bachman, were 
re-elected. 

The officers named were: J. R. Bachman, secretary of the Atlanta 
Milling company, president; E. S. Ehney, of E. 8S. Ehney & Co., first 
vice president; Samuel Martin, second vice president; L. G. Neal, head 
of the Royal Cotton Products company, third vice president; H. E. | 
Watkins, vice president and treasurer of the Empire Cotton Oil com- 
pany, treasurer,.and J. Hope Tigner, secretary and superintendent. 

The following directors, whose terms of office expired January 1, 
1922, were elected for a two-year period: J. J. Williamson, T. J. Brooks, 
W. A. Gilreath and W. J. Croswell. 

Directors named who will serve for a one-year period are J. R. 
Ellis, Jr., Robert A. Smythe, George C. Speir, Henry Hilbraith, P. R. 
Lamar, E. P. McBurney, L. M. Jordan,eSamuel Martin, F. M. Inman, 
L. G. Neal and Lee Ashcraft. 

Under the head of general business, the reports of J. Hope Tigner, 
secretary, and H. E. Watkins, treasurer, were heard and approved. 
Mr. Tigner’s report showed that the membership for the past year had 
been practically at a standstill, when compared with that of the pre- 
vious year, due, as he said, to the business depression which has 
characterized the period since the war.

Tigner. The report gives compara- 
tive statements of the markets in Néw 
York, New Orleans, Liverpool and Chi- 
cago, as well as local cotton condi- 
tions. In the report it was stated 
that under new developments of the 
past year, a system of weight certifi- 
cates has been established and other 
general improvements have been made. 

Mr. Tigner commended the work of 
Walter R. Davis, chief grain inspec- 
tor of the Atlanta Commercial ex- 
change, who has rendered the organi- 
zation invaluable service during the 
year. Mr. Davis is federal inspector 
of grain and is recognized also as one 
of the four best inspectors in the em- 
ploy of the National Hay association 
in the United States, said Mr. Tigner. 


_Mr. Bachman emphasized the need 
fo: broader markets in the state. He 
called attention to the fact that, al- 
though many Georgia institu- 
tions claim the credit for awakening 
the public to the need of wider mar- 
keting facilities, it was the Atlanta | 
Commercial exchange that 
brought the question into the public 
eye. 

“T-cannot, for the life of me, help 
seeing Atlanta a great spot cotton 
market,” said Mr. Bachman. “Geor- 
gia’s repressive laws have been some- 
what in the way. There must be the 
opportunity for exercising proper spec- 
ulative interests in order to do away 
with the abuses. I believe, if it be- 
came the purpose of the exchange to 
propose amelioration of the laws, our 
law-making body would listen to it. 

“T am one to believe that the wealth 


of our country lies in cotton, and must | 


always be there, and you who are con- 
cerned with cotton must disabuse the 
minds of those who believe that the 
state may forge ahead in agricultural 
and marketing with the exclusion of 


cotton. 
To Meet Thursday.

IN MANY TKS 


New York, January 17.—Profes- 
sional traders were in undisputed con- 
trol of today’s stock market, their 
bullish maneuvers effecting substan- 
tial gains in a wide variety of issues. 
Unlike the previgus session, however, 
rails were inconspicuous until the 
later dealings, when cotton carriers, 
transcontinentals and coalers came 
briskly forward. 

Speculative interest was most keen 
in the independent steels, also the 
motors, oils, coppers, rubbers and 
chemicals, with intermittent activity 
in utilities, especially express com- 
pany shares and People’s Gas, 


Specific instances of strength were | 


furnished by Gul States Steel, which 
enhanced its recent 12 point advance 
| by 4 points, later reacting moderate- 
ly, also Studebaker, the most active 
feature of the day, Sloss-Sheffied 
Chandler, National Lead, Na- 


‘ical and fertilizer specialties, 


Sluggishness was shown by equip- 
ments, sugars and minor food spe- 
cialties, but reactions in those groups 
were moderate. Selling for profits 
detracted from the market’s best 
prices in the final dealings, but the 
glosing was strong. 


The money market encouraged oper- 
ations for the long account, call loans 
opening and holding at 41-2 per cent 
against yesterday’s maximum of 6 
per cent. Time loans running from 
30 to 90 days were made at the furth- 
er concession of 41-4 per cent. 


Foreign exchanges reflected the 
further uncertainties arising from 
Anglo-French relations. Sterling was 
slightly lower and almost the entire 
range of continental bills eased from 
3 to almost 10 points. 


Bonds were less active, but firm in 
almost every division, notably Liberty 
and high- grade railway issues. Total 
sales, par value, $17, 775,000. Of 
new underwritings the most impor- 
tant was that of the Southern railway

federal control. Of this total, $3,- 

000 were issued by the Pennsy)- 
vania and were sold by tne govern- 
ment to a Chicago bank. This brings 
the total sale of equipment notes to 
date by the government to $164,226.,- 
000. All of these notes were solid by 
the government at par ana carry in- 
terest at the rate of 6 per cent. It 
was learned today that for a time the 
investment bankers buying these is- 
sues from the government had a hard 
time meeting competition from out- 
standing and new securities. How- 
ever, the easing of money during the 
rast few months has resulted in a 
general readjustment of security prices 
making the railroad equipment notes 
more attractive. There never hag 
been & default on a railroad equip- 
mert note and hence these notes have 
enviable standing with well-posted in- 
vestors. 

A syndicate of bankers will make an 
offering some time before the end of 
this month it was reported today of 

$7,000,000 acceptances of the Cuba 
Cane company. 

Pittsburg dispatches report that 
since the price of Pennsytvania crude 
oil was cut the last time to $3.25, the 
offerings to_large pipe-line concerng

Stock Gossip. 

The following financial news and | 
comment Tuesday was received by 
the Atlanta office of Doremus- -Daniel | 
company, over its leased wire: 

Wall street was in no way dis- 
turbed by the advance in call money 
4rom 31-2 per cent and it was gen- 
erally understood that the rise was 
practically a moving back to a rea- 
sonable range fron; abnormally low 


rates. 


Many think dividend paying rails 


‘have still a long way to go before 


they make a full response to the im- 


| proved investment situation resulting 


from the changed money conditions. 


Northern Pacific was spoken of as 


| selling far below ite appreciable value, 


but quiet buying ef that stock is in 
progress, the orders coming to great 
extent from those close to the com- 


pany. 


Bankers and New Haven rail of- 
ficials are studying plans for paying 
off the road’s foreign loan of $27,- 
582.000 wkich matures April 1, No 
decision has been ~reached. 


Tentative agreement was reached 
at conference of railway executives 
and brotherhood chiefs in Washing-

Buying of the dividend paying rails, 
while perhaps not as pronounced as 


Central, Illinois Central, Union Pa- 
cific and Southern Pacific is absolute- 
ly justifiable. 


Reports that Studebaker is to de- 
clare an extra-dividend are increas- 
ing and stock is at present absolutely 
the feature of the market. 


Southern Railroad Bonds. 
New York, January 17.—J. P. Mor- 


(kan & Co. today opened and immediate- 


ly closed subscription books for a 
$30,000,000 development and general 
mortgage bond issue of the South- 
ern railway, bearing 61-2 per cent in- 
terest. It was announced the issue 
was heavily oversubscribed. 


Idle Capital. 


The enormous sums of idle capital 
seeking investment channels through 
this market are evidenced not only by 
lower rates for call and time funds, 
but more especially by the many ac- 
tual and prospective domestic and for- 
eign underwritings. 

It was stated today that since the 
beginning of the new year the bond 
market has shown such pronotinced 
recovery as to enable the closing out 
of a number of banking syndicates 
which had long been hanging fire, 

Today’s broad market was strong 
proof of the confidence shown by inves- 
tors, the new Sonthern railway $30,- 
000,000 bond issue being largely over- 
subscribed before any pablic offering 
was made. 

Among the new foreign issues an 
international banking house activel 
identified with French municipal a 
ferings during the war announced the 
virtual completion of a $25,000,000 
bond lean to the department of the 
Seine, France. 

Local bankers also closed negotia- 
tions for two Canadian provincial 
loans aggregating $8,000,000. 


To Make Probe. 
Washington, January 17.—A spe- 
cial investigation of charges against 
the General Electric company, result- 
ing from investigations of the Lock- 
wood committee in New York, will be 
begun by the department of stice 
within a few days, Attorney-General 

Daugherty announced today. 
Correspondence between the _ de- 
partment and the General Electric 
company was published recently, the 
attorney-general said, in which‘it was 


brought out that charges had been} 


made against the company to the ef- 
fect that it- had created a monopoly, 
extorted millions of dollars from the 
public, juggled its accounts to avoid 
payment of income taxes, and violated 
a decree of a Cleveland court, re 
straining it. from a unlawful acts. 


- Relative to “Une 

In its survey of unemployment in 
the United States, the National In- 
dustrial Conference board, of New 
York, makes the following state- 
ment : 

“Unemployment is clearly not an 
occasional or accidental tion te 
be met by charitable or philanthropic 
relief, but a continuing condition, at 
times becoming acute. Its improve- 
ment is. dn ) aac an industrial prob- 
lem. of the first magnitude. It con- 
cerns so large a number of indus- 
trial workers and is so vital to in-

PROFESSIONAL VIEWS 
ON COTTON SITUATION 


New York, January 17.—(Special.)— 
Freed offerings of spot cotton out of the 
south caused an easier market in Liver- 
pool today. As a result our market opened 
some 20 points under last night’s close. 
With the south a good seller of hedges 
these sales were well absorbed by open 
orders from the trade, fixing price on cot- 
ton previously —— during the day. The 
market gradually improved under scattered 
short covering, induced by an unconfirmed 


‘report of the appearance of the pink boll 


worm in northern Louisiana. The advance 
is in reality a natural rally after the de- 
cline of yesterday as there is nothing new 
in the general situation. In fact the indif- 
ference of dry goods buyers, who are now in 
town is rether disappointing,

GRAIN REGISTERS 


Ohicago, January 17.— Wheat aver- 
aged a little higher in price today, 

helped more or less by announcement 
of a good-sized decrease in the world’s 
available supply last week. The mur- 
ket closed firm at 1-4 to 5-Sc net gain, 
with May $1.11 7-8 to $1.12, and 
July $1.00 3-8 to $1.00 1-2. Corn 
finished 1-8 to 1-4c higher; oats up 
1-8 to 1-4c, and provisions varied from 
unchanged figures to a rise of 15c. 

The decrease in world stocks of 
wheat amounted to 4,635,000 bushels 
and was given emphasis by word that 
estimates of the Australian surplus 
were being reduced, official reports 
from two provinces indicating yields 
of 15,000,000 bushels less than was 
the case last year. Unfavorable crop 
reports from Oklahoma and elsewhere 
southwest tended also to lift prices 
somewhat. Until the last part of the 
session, however, the selling side of the 
market appeared to have the advan- 
tage, as most of the wheat bought yes- 
terday for seed purposes in Russia 
turned out to be Canadian instead of 
United States wheat. Slowness of 
domestic milling demand for wheat 
counted also as a temporary depress- 
ing factor, but séemed to be lost sight 
of at the last, when the attention of 
traders had been partly turned for the 
time being to adverse crop conditions 
southwest. 

The slight advance in the value of 
corn and oats were ascribed chiefly to 
the fact that rural offerings of corn 
to arrive here lacked folume, especial- 
ly from Illinois points. 

Provisions tended upward in ‘price, 
as a result of a sharp advance in the 
hog market. Owners of lard, how- 
ever, showed considerable disposition 
to realize profits.

Sugar., ~ 

New York, January 17.—The raw sugar 
market was firm and uncharged for Cubas 
in nearby positions, with saies reported of 
60,000 bars to a local refiner at 2 cents, 
cost and freight, equal to 8.61 for centrif- 
ugal. Later deliveries, however, .were firm- 
er, with sales of 22,400 bags to an operator 
for March shipment at 2%c, cost and 
freight, equal to 3.73 for centrifugal. Porto 
Ricos were also firm, holders asking 3.61 
for centrifugal, although no sales were re- 
perted at that level. 

There was a little more activity.in the 
raw sugar futures market today, and nrices 
were firmer, at one time showing advances 
of 3 to 8 points on buying by trade inter- 
ests and commission houses, prompted by 
the steadiness in the spot market. Near 
the close there was a partial setback under 
realizing, with final prices one to six polnts 

higher. Mareh closed at 2.25; May 2.46; 

y 2.67; September 2.81. 

In refined there was no increase nected in 
the domestic demand, although a good re- 
port inquiry was noted and vales were re-

DRAWS OPPOSITION 


‘ 

Application by the Association ‘of 
Atlanta Architects to renderyall archi- 
tectural service for the new bond issue 
schools, was submitted Tuesday after- 
nooh before a joint meeting of the 
board of education and the schools 
committee of the bond commission. 
Two individual firms indepentdent of 
the association put in their requests 
for part of the work. ) 
After hearing the plan of the asso- 
ciation and the statements of the 
“free lance” applicants, the matter 
of architectural service was referred 
to a committee composed of Frank M. 


Inman and Miss Laura’ Smith. of the 
bond commission, and President W. 
W. Gaines, and W. L. McCalley, Jr., 
of the board of education. 

P. Thornton Marye, president of the 
local chapter of the American In- 
stitute of architects; A. Ten Eyck 
Brown and Hal F. Hentz, as a com- 
mittee from the association, presented 
its proposal. Mr. Marye acted as 
spokesman and stated that the associ- 
ation proposed to deal as an individual 
with the city throug h an “administra- 
tive architect,” aa allocate the work 
among its members . 

He stated that it was the architects - 
plan to name the administrative archi- 
tect subject to approval and = con- 
firmation by the bond commission and 
board of education. The administra- 
tive architect would be directly re- 
sponsible to the city. The plan of 
allocation, he said, would be through 
a system of rating which would de- 
a the qualifications of each mem- 

er. 


Fee of Six Per Cent. 


Mr. Marye named a fee of 6 per 
cent of the cost of construction, which 
he stated is the minimum fee of archi- 
tects, according to the schedule of the 
American Institute of Architects, and 
1 per cent to be paid to the administra- 
tive architect and 5 per cent to those 
sharing in the preparation of plans. 

Sharp opposition to the proposition 
was immediately voiced by members 
and W. L. MecCalley and Council- 
man J. C. Murphy, members of the 
education board, urged that it be re- 
jected. Commissioner Carl Hutche- 
son declared that the association, as 
it appeared to him, had “all the ear 
marks of a local Arust.” 

Judge John Candler, Major R. J. 
Guinn and other members of the bond 
commission, said they were not pre- 
pared to vote on a motion to reject 
and it was withdrawn. 

Chip Roberts, of Robert & company, 
architects and engineers, submitted the 
company’s application to plan the new 
Tech High school. This company is 
already supervising architect for the 
expansion program of Georgia Tech. 


Ostracized Company. 


_Mr. Robert said that the associa- 
tion of architects had “ostracized” 
his company because it was not a 
purely architectural concern but fur- 
nished engineering service also. He 
promised, if given the work, to send 
experts of his campany to the best 
technical centers of the country to 
study their systems and use this 
knowledge in planning the new institu- 
ion 

Lockwood, Green and company, ar- 
chitects and engineers, with offices in 
the Healey building. was the other in- 
dependent firm asking for a share of 
the work. Representatives said they 
were not members of the American In- 
stitute of Architects and had not been 
invited to join the association. 

Preceding the joint session of the 
bond committee and the board, the full 
bond commission held a brief meeting 
and discussed propoded disnosition of 
a part of the $8,850,000 issue. Fur- 
ther consideration of the matter was 
referred to the finance committee of 
the body.

Killed In Action? 

Called ‘before the committee oday, 
Varney E. Wells, of Wilmington, de- 
clared with great positiveness that 
while he had no direct proof on the 
to the best 
of. his knowledge that King was killed 
in action. Giving the young corporal 
the highest record, Wells declared 
there were other North Carolina men 
with the platoon who could furnish 
evidence, and they will be summoned. 

Senator Watson sharply criticised 
Wells for failure to te.] King’s mother, 


of the alleged lynching were without 
foundation. But it was not until 
after publication «cf the Harrison 
eet that the talk bécame gen- 
eral. 
Satisfied in his own mind that 
King was not lynched, Senator Over- 
man indicated that he was determin- 
ed to clear away all doubt, regardless 
of how many witnesses it might be 
necessary to call. 
All Bodies Identified. 
Disagreeing with witnesses who pre- 
ceded him,, Richard C. Sullivan, of 
Somerville, Mass., an assistant em-,; 
balmer with the graves registration | 
service, declared he saw two bodies 
taken up rope and black cap intact. 
“Every body I helped prepare for

Was there any evidence that = 
heart and brain were removed fro 
the bodies of the men hanged?’ sabel 
Senator Watson. 

“I did not notice.” 

“Were the men buried in a sepa- 
rate part of the cemetery?’ y, 

“They were not.” 

“If the skulls had ‘been opened

“Undoubtedly.”

“And you mean to say that these 
men hanged tor an alimust unmentou- 
able crime were buried along with the 
honorable dead?’ Senator Watson 
asked. 

“x, es, They were our men who had 
fallen und paid the extreme penalty.”’ 

Some of ine decwrs acer suggesred, 
he added, that in future executions 
the bodies be buried in separate lots, 
but there were no other ereeutions ar 
that post. 

stusus Hubbard, who recently tes- 
tified that many bedies were sent 
home without proper identincation, 
was — by Major Samuel J. 
Hieidner, now of West Point, Age 
as a civilian employee, ° 
worst trouble maker in the section.’ 

Major henner agreed with Mub- 
bard, however, that a rope and ‘biack 
cap were tound on two bedies dug up 
at Bazoilles., 

“The body of only one of the men 
hanged was shipped to the United 
States and in botn instunces the cap 

and rope were removed,” said the wit- 


ness. 
Identification Methods. 

The care taken by the graves reg- 

istration service in making sure of the 
identitication of each soldier’s body was 
described by Captain Charles J. 
Wynne, of Washington, in charge of 
records, 
“Of the 43,000 bodies shipped to the 
United States, every single one was 
identified,” said Captain Wynne. “The 
records thus far show 2,016 uniden- 
tified dead. The chances of mistakes 
in identification ‘were very small.” 

There were six records out of the 
43,000 of the shipping of wrong body, 
but in each case the errors were cor- 
rected, he said, explaining that this 
was due to similarity of names on 
shipping orders. 

Captain Wynne said that in the 
course of his work he . never came 
— a ‘body with a rope around the 
neck, 

“Were negroes buried alongside of 
white men?” asked Senator Watson. 

“Yes, sir—they were soldiers.” 

Rope in Coffins. 

Norvak Tabler, of Washingvop, said 
the bodies of two negroes were dis- 
interred at Bazoilles with rope and 
cap in coffins, along with identifica- 
tion records in bottles. 

“The rope was removed from one 
body before it was buried,” said Tab- 
ler.. “I am confident it was remov- 
ed from the other.” 


“What was Rufus Hubbard’s repu- 


tation for veracity?’ the witness was 
asked. 
“Not good.” 
Said They Were Lynched. 


While on his way to work one day 
at a prison camp at Gievres, John Se- 
bastian, of Jacksonville, Fla.,said he 
passed the bodies of two negro soldiers 
fac. downward on the ground, 

“In the presence of eight hundred 
prisoners, the sergeant announced that 
the negroes had been lynched,” said 
Sebastian. “He told us to watch our 
step or we would get the same dope.” 

Answering Chairman Brandegee, Se- 
bastian said he was in fpwison eight 
months for being absent without leave 
and escaping confinement. He did 
not know how the men had come to 
their death. 

One of the prisoners went over to 
look at the bodies and was ordered 
away by the guard, said Sebastian. 


Woman Testifies. * 


The first woman to appear before 
the committee, Mrs. Griffiths, of 
Washington,. whose husband, Colonel 
Richard H. Griffiths, was killed in 
France, told of going to France in an 
effort to locate and identify his body. 

“It was a headless body,” she de- 
clared, “and there was no tag on it.” 

“Are you sure the body was, or was 
not, that of your husband?’ 

“It was quite impossible to tell.” 

Mrs. Griffiths declared there were 
no identification marks on crosses 
above the graves at the cemetery 
where her husband was buried. 

The session was adjourned until 
tomorrow. »s 


DUPRE WILL REACH 
ATLANTA TODAY 


Continued from First Page. 


Atlanta pawnbrokers, whose names 
were withheld temporarily, were said 
to have been members of a gang of 


diamond: thieves. 

The law firm of C. P. and Ernest 
Bentley has been retained to represent 
Geogham. 

The alleged syndicate is the latest 
and the most far-reaching development 
reported in the sensational series of 
events since the escape of DuPre from 
Atlanta, in an automobile. 

_ Betty ,Andrewsy known as “the girl 
in the Case,” detectives last night 
stated, is accused, from facts set 
forth in DuPre’s confession, as being 
accessory both before and after the 
fact. Geoghan is being held on sus- 
picion without bond. 

Admits Two Robberies. 

DuPre confessed to two jewelry 
store robberies, in one of which. he 
declared, that of Davis & Freeman’ s

because of having been in communi-

which just a month ago was the vor-

the news spread that a man had been

The gorgeous jewel lays with its 
brothers on display, its only distin- 
Aang feature being the fact that 

color- is clearer and purer, its 
liance more striking, its size and 
weight dwarfing many of its fellows. 

There is nothing to show that its 
history covers more than the aeons of 
darkness under thousands of tons of 
rock and soil of a foreign land, the 
modern alchémy that wrought from a 
dull bit of stone, the polished gem 
that it now is, and the casual change 
of ownership that every diamond 
knows.

It could tell of the gleam it re- 
flected from the eves of a love-crazed 
boy, desperately fighting to win the 
woman whose heart was set on dia- 
monds and display. 

It could tell of the surge of wild 
criminal blood that gave force to cold 
fingers. pressed to the trigger of a 
deathly weapon as one man died and 
another fell badly wounded in defense 
of the flashing gem.

own tiny halo on the Diuck velvet 
beneath, laboring under a curse as 
tragic and as sure as the fateful 
jewels of history whose years have 
been traced in never-failing blood and 
suffering. 

Time alone can - ot in this 
age of dying superstitution there are 
few who would not scoff at the idea 


Maybe the same jewel will be worn 
on a hand as pure and soft as its 
own serene rays, symbolizing . the’ 
union of two hearts forever warmed by 
abiding, tender ve. 

Mayhap in the coming years, the 
gleaming gem will catch bright eyes 
and attract tiny hands in their aim-

a smile to the face of ‘the little mite 
that gazes round in constant wonder. 

It may be that the same — 
may be gently pressed upon a wither- 
ed y ed by another withered hand, 
and that it may revive memories of. 
youth that has passed and love that 
will never die. 

All this and more may come to pass 
as years flow by and human minds 
forget the thrills and sensations of 
today. 

And meantime, Frank DuPre is 

“coming home.” 


possession, was given in communica- 
tions from eDtroit Tuesday : 

“Dear Frank: Sorry you got 
in that trouble. Mailed your let- 
ter. So far it has not been pub- 
lished. 1 have got married since 
you left. She has not told her 
pdrents as yet. We hope to keep 
it a secret until 1 lose my job, 
which 1 expect to last for about 
two months. It’s ’Frisco for me 
then. Well, Frank, you will have 
to be very careful and not let 
any woman know your trouble. 
Do not give up, but try and fol- 
low the straight road. ‘That is, 
do the right thing from now on, 
and I believe you can _ pull 
through and-make good. 

“Best em. from your old 
friend, V. 
. 2 sit ever published will 
send you copy.’ 

That Betty Andrews came to At- 
lanta as a chorus girl with the Chu 
Chin Chow company, remaining after 
she had met DuPre, was alleged in 
dispatches from Detective Sturdivant, 
i etroit. 

DuPre Talks Freely. 

DuPre continued to talk freely: pri- 
or to his departure with Atlanta de- 
tectives for Atlanta. He told of the 
manner in which he first met Betty 
Andrews, saying that he had entered 
the parlor at Childs hotel one eve- 
ning and heard her playing on the 
piano an old love song that he liked. 

He did not formally meet her, but 
told her then how much he liked the 
selection. Five uneventful days fol- 
lowed. Then came the day when he 
took a desperate chance on his liberty 
and his life by attempting to steal— 
for her, he continued to declare. He 
still later.defied all tradition in crim-- 
inology and again jeopardized his life 
by taking the chance of wiring her 
$40 from Norfolk, Va. But for a 
girl friend in the Western Union of- 
fice there, he would have been caught, 
he said. 

Practically everything which DuPre 
has said since arrival of the Atlanta 
detectives in Detroit has been put 
on paper. The detectives have in 
their possession a mass of documents, 
statements, affidavits and other ma- 
terial. which will be used at the trial 
of the bandit-slayer. 

T No 


aking Cc . 
‘When City Detecti ve Sturdivant 
and Detective Fenn, of the Pinker- 
ton operatives, left Detroit with their 
prisoner, they carried out in full their 
prearranged program of taking no 
chances. DuPre, his hands bandcuffed 
and his feet manacled, appeared will- 
ing enough to accompany them, de- 
spite the fact that Hut a few hours 
before he had begged them not to re- 
turn him to Atlanta. | 

DuPre experienced a tremendous 
nervous reaction shortly after he was 
placed in the hands of the detectives 
to begin the trip south. So great was 
the reaction and so apparently wreck- 
ing to his nervous fiber, that the de- 
tectives were apprehensive for a time | 
as to. his being in physical condition 
to commence the trip. 

DuPre, when told that his lawyers 
in Atlanta will file a plea of insani- 
ty, grasped the idea quickly and 
eagerly. 


I acted even then,” he told reporters, 
who interviewed him again Tuesday. 
“I was blind drunk, but I must have 
been kind of nutty, too.” 

Hered 


itary Insanity. 

Bernard Cappell, Atlanta attorney, 
who was retained Monday to repre- 
sent DuPre, acting on the request 
of DuPre’s uncte, J. ©. Cox, who is 
coroner of Abbeville, 8, C., stated that 
he can prove that theré is a streak 
of insanity in the DuPre family, and 
that DuPre’s father is unbalanced, 
his condition having been brought 
about partially by the death of his 
wife, DuPre’s mother, three years 
ago, and the present plight of his son. 

Solicitor John Boykin, on the other 
hand, stated he is prepared to prompt- 
ly set all the wheels of justice into 
nfotion to insure a speedy trial which 
will impose on DuPre the death pen- 


Chief W. 8S. Hackett, of the Chatta- 
nooga police force, Tuesday gave out 
statements which showed the trailing 
of the bandit to the spot where he 
was captured by Detroit officers. : 

Offered $700 for Ring. 

When DuPre first reached  chatta- 
nooga, the day after the and 
slaying in Atlanta, Chief Hackett 
said, he went to the Star Loan office 
where he was offered $700 for the

20 Druid place. Mr. West Tuesday 
gave ap interesting story of the trag- 
edy which almost cost him his life 
and which caused him to linger for 
several weeks between life and death 
at a sanitarium., 

He stated he had been to lunch 
in the Kamball House with a friend, 
John Paseo, and together they were 
walking out of the Peachtree street 
entrance. They had just turned up 
the street toward the viaduct when 
they saw a man running in their di- 
rection and heard a cry of “Catch 
him !” 

Both Followed DuPre. 


They turned just as the man, who 
was wearing a gray overcoat with 
cap of the same color, dashed into 
the Kimball lobby. They fullowed. 

Mr. West said he was at least ten 
feet behind DuPre, who had both 
hands in his overcoat’ pockets. At the 
first set of dfsecending stairs, DuPre 
fell, either having stumbled or be- 
cause some one. had tripped him. 

Rising to his knees, the man shot 
twice. Both bullets hit the comp- 
troller and he fell, bleeding profuse 
ly. The bandit fired both bullets 
through his overcoat pocket, without 
taking the gun out. 


Remembers Hospital. 


People then began running in rap- 
idly and calling out. Some one 
reached over him and said: “My God, 
it’s Graham West!’ he said. He re- 
members the arrival of the ambulance 
and even of being taken into a ward 
at Grady hospital. He said he did 
not lose consciousness until they ad- 
ministered an anaesthetic: 

Mr. West’s account of the shooting 
came as a surprise, because the belief 
was general that he was grappling 
with the fleeing man when shot. Mr. 
West declared he did not touch the 
man, .but was several feet from him 
when the bullets were fired.

for a white man and a negro who es- 

caped from the policewoman after she 
had arrested them at a n house 
in Oakland City in the act of deliver- 
ing a suitcase of whisky. 

Mrs. McDonald went. with a friend 
to a negro laufdrywoman’s house 
near Oakland City late Tuesday after- 
noon. They stopped their car in front

As she sat waiting for her friend 
to return from the washerwoman’s 
house, she naiticed a car drive up and 
stop behind the one. she occupied. 
Overhearing some conversation about 
whisky, she began to take notice of 
the proceedings. 

Soon a white man and negro 
alighted from the car and took a 
heavy suitcase into the house. Foi- 
lowing them she covered them with 
her revolver after they had entered 
the house, She commanded them to 
return to ‘their car with the suitcase. 

The white man got in the cat at 
once, and started the, motor and said 
he intended to turn the machine 
around. She made him stop the motor. 
“You’d better watch your negro,” he 
told her. Turning. she saw the negro 
running away. and fired. As she 
turned the man in the machine got 
out and started running. 
turned her revolver on#him, but he 
esca ped. 

The woman officer notified head- 


‘quarters, and the car and whisky was 


confiscated by the department. Detec- 
tives stated Tuesday night that the 


‘ear has been recently . stolen.

railroad wage question, the manage;

labor. board for final action, it was 
announced this afternoon by -W. P. 
Bruce, general manager of the road. 

Following a conference recently be- 
tween officials of the road and repre- 
sentatives of the telegraphers, the lat- 
ter announced that they would not vol- 
untarily accept the proposed decrease 
of 4 cents an hour, but on the other 
hand, wished an increase in wages of 
6 cents an hour. 

Since the conferences on the. wage 
controversy were opened about two 
weeks ago with the various classes of 
employees only in two cases has defi- 
nite decision been reached. The pro- 
posals of the road as applicable to the 
signal men and the telegraphers will 
be placed in the hands of the labor 
board for consideration, Mr. Bruce 
stated. ‘Ihe management is still dick- 
ering with representatives of prac- 
tically all of the other employees. 

However, joint submissions’ will

conferences have been conducted with

Was a ‘Bear Cat’? 


“My wife was never an angel, but 
after five years of liver and stomach 
trouble she became a-~*bear cat.’ No 
doctor or medicine helped her an 
we thought there was no help for her. 
Our grocer told me of Mayr’s Wonder- 
ful Remedy, which had helped him for 
same trouble, so I brought home a 
bottle, but she promptly threw it out. 
I got jt back and after a week coaxed 
her into taking it. She is now en- 
joying the best of health and dispo- 
sition.” It is a simple, harmless prep- 
aration that removes the catarrhal 
mucus from the intestinal tract and 
allays the inflammation which causes 
practically all stomach, liver and in- 


citis. One dose will convince or money 
refunded. Jacobs’ Pharmacy and
