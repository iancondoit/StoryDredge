p. O. REMODELING 
PLANS INSPECTED 
BY U. S. ARCHITECT 


Plans for the remodeling *. the At- 
Pl postoffice, as proposed by Post- 
master George C. Kogers, are under 
inspection by James M. Geary, super- 
vising architect in the postoffice de- 


j partment in Washington, D. C., who 


was in the city Thursday. 

With the idea of securing the 
greatest convenience to the public in 
the location of the windows in the 
lobby of the Atlanta postoffice, Mr. 
Rogers drew up the plans and submit- 
ted them to the Washington office for 
approval. In one line in the Forsyth 
street lobby will be located stamp 
windows, money order, registry and 
insurance departments, as well as u 
mailing room and general ek oes 
window. 

Mail boxes will be located on the 
Poplar and Walton street sides. There 
will be doors at the corners of the 
building for more convenient entrance 
and exit. One of the proposed changes 
is the erection of a mezzanine floor 
across the building, in which would 
be placed the departments now in the 
ee of the building. Mr. Rogers 

ed that he believed that present 
congestion and expansion for several 
years would be taken care of by the 
new plans.

ene Sibley and 


Power company to restrain the state 
railroad commission from enforcing its 
recent order reducing — rates in At 
lanta from $1.65 $1.55 net a 
thousand cubic eens 

The injunction proceedings were 
brought recently after the commission 
had handed down its order to reduce 


rates. Under a recent ruling of courts }. 


in federal. procedure such rate cases 
must be heard by three federal judges. 
Two other federal judges could not be 
‘obtained at present for a session in 
Atlanta because of conflicting courts. 


It was decided to hold the session at 


New Orleans, where there would be 


Dr. L. N. Huff, of Atlanta, to 
ereased gas rates, will also attend the 
hearing in New Orleans, and has an- 
nounced that he will employ a lawyer 
of New Orleans to assist Chairman 
Caudler and Judge Reagan in the case. 

Representing the Georgia Railway 
and Power company at the hearing 
will be P. S8. Arkwright, president, 
and Attorneys Jack Spalding, Luther 
Z. Rosser, Walter Colquitt and J. 
Prince Webster. 

The company will submit a state- 
ment of facts, a brief of complaints, 
and a number of affidavits from Mr. 
Arkwright, president of the Georgia 
Rialway and Power company; H. M. 
Atkinson, chairman of the board: G. 
W. Brine, vice president o the Geor- 
gia Railway and Power company and 
president of the Gas Light company, 
and others. 

The company contends that the val- 
ue of the company's property given 
by the railroad commission is too low 
and cites reports of many engineers 
and a number; of court decisions to 
substantiate this claim. The com- 
pany also claims omission of prop- 
erties, wrong rule of valde, mistakes 
of law, findings without evidence and 
against the weight of evidence, on the 
part of the Georgia commission.

Hou You Can Have 
$63 Next Christmas in Cash 


W HILE talking to some of the friends of the ‘Lowry 
Bank lately about the Christmas Savings Club, 


we have been told: sie 
Act afford to put aside any money“ 


It was for just such people that the plan of Christ- 
mas Savings was organized. 


Many people do not realize how much a little 
money saved each. week will amount to in the course 


of a year. 


For instance, in the progressive plan” you can 
save 5 cents the first week, 10 cents the next, and so 
on, increasing 5 cents each week, and next December 


you will have over $63. 


Thre are five other plans under which you can 
save. You receive interest on your deposits. Come in 
and start your account ‘today. :

‘within the expected revenue, the 
finance committee of council went in-

necessary to make the budget of ex-

generous in making its tentative ap- 
propriations. 
“The city has approximately 5100,

a year ago,” the alderman said, and 
the committee has kppropriated about

News that the. governot’s horse 
guard is ready to take the field came 
to The Constitution Thursday in a 
letter written by A. C. Willson, of the 
Southern States Life Insurance com- 


* 


organization. 

“T see that the Rotary. elub is pre 
pared to call out the ho guard and 
the Georgia navy, if n ary, to pre- 
serve the rights of Unde Bim Gump 
in his campaign to win the heart of 
the Widow Zander. Although not a 
member of the Georgia navy I am a 
member of the governor’s horse guard 
and I do think that Uncle Bim can 
‘depend on the loyal support of the 
ar Mr. Willson: writes. 

Along with this military aid Uncle 
Bim also received promise of help of 
a tactical kind. E. A. Thompson, as- 
sistant superintendent of the state 
banking department, agreed Thursday 
to let Uncle Bim use his copy of that 
invaluable volume “How to Woo and 
Win.” The book is rather thumb worn 
and Mr. Thompson yet has to report 
any practical success from , following 
its advice but he says it has helped 
him on his way.” 

Patrick H. Mell, a capitol beau 
brummel, announced Thursday that 
* is ready. to go to Chicago in person 
and let Uncle Bim in on the secret of 
how to handle the “wimmen” and to 
let Uncle Bim look over his exmaina; 
tion papers in the correspondence 


While the supporters of Uncle Bim 
were busy Thursday the admirers 
“Andy” and Min“ were not inactive 
by any means. It is hinted that the 
West Side Sewing circle and the East 
Side Five Q’Clock Tea club are labor- 
ing over resolutions which may be 
fired at any time. 

Let the resolutions come. 


Baptist Ministers 
Will Hold Missions 
In Canal Zone 


Griffin, Ga., January 12.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Dr. Leon M. Latimer, pastor 
of the First Baptist church of Griffin, 
and Rev. L. E. Dutton, pastor of the 
First Baptist chruch, of Cartersville, 
will leave Griffin within the next few 
days for the Panama canal zone. 


Dr. Latimer has been selected by 
the state home mission board to con- 
duct a series of meetings in the canal 
zone, and Mr. Dutton was selected to 
lead the singing. Dr. Latimer will 
be in the canal zone for several 
weeks, as it is the pla. of the board 
to have him conduct missions at most 
of the important cities and towns of 
the zone. These missions will be 
in the nature of revival meetings. It 
is very likely that Dr. B. D. Gray, 
president of the state home mission 
board of Georgia, also will accompany 
Dr. Latimer and Mr. Dutton.

Unghes vocational classes. 
Matters of especial interest taken 
up at the meeting were a talk by 


ily. De Sales Harrison, business 
manager of the Howard theater, who 
spoke of the close connection between 
the moving picture industry and the 


stimulation of the interest of chil- 
dren in better pictures. His prize 
of ten loge seats for any Howard 
performance selected by the winner, 
was awarded to Mrs. E. D. McDon- 


who later invited the executive board 
of the home economics department, to 
be her guests, in in addition to other 
friends. 

Through the courtesy of Charles 
A. Sisson, of the A. K. Hawkes com- 
‘pany, a splendid, most instructive 
talk, was given on the use of vari- 


‘home, especially for cooking and can- 
ning. These were passed among the 
‘audience for inspection and a regu- 
lar temperature thermometer was 
given by Mr. Sisson to the clubhouse, 
which he said should register between 
68 and 70 degrees to secure the great- 
est efficiency among the club women. 
A gift of a Taylor home set, consist- 
ing of sugarmeter for canning and 
preserving; a candy thermometer for 
jelly and candymaking, and an oven 
thermometer to insure uniform bak- | eo 
‘ing, were given for the use of the 
department by the A. K. Hawkes com- 
pany. These are heartily indorsed by 
the home economics department, and 
their use recommended in the splen- 
and rv- 
ing in the Atlanta Woman's club 
‘cook issued by this department 
‘of the club. 

“ Invitations from other cookbook ad- 
vertisers inviting the members to in- 
‘spect their factories, etc., were read 
by the chairman. In order to accept 
these invitations, it is more than ever 


rds accurate, in order to have only 
‘members with good attendance rec- 
‘ords invited on these occasions, in or- 
der to prevent overcrowding, as the 
department now num over ;

in what I bad to say about the folly 
of letting the habit of little 

go uncontrolled, wants to know what 
I think about the oid question of 


whether jealousy can exist without | 
love. . 


I suppose it depends on just what 
you mean by jealousy. 


prehensive; uneasy through fear that 
good will, interest, affection or the 
like, regarded as belonging to onseself, 
is transferred to another; pained by 
suspicions of preference given to an-. 
other.“ 
One's Vanity Might Be Touched. 


Would one mind the loss of affec- 
tion if one did not love the party 
from whom one received this affec- 
tion? 

I suppose it would be possible to 
mind because one’s vanity would be 
touched, and I believe that this kind of 
jealousy does exist. But I do not think 
it is either so common or 80 poignant 
as the other kind. 

To go further into the familiar con- 
troversy—where jealousy and love do 
exist together, does a great jealousy 
mean that the love that goes with it 
must be greater than the love that has 
no jealousy? 

More of Self-Love Than Love in 

Jealousy. 


I doubt it. “In jealousy,” says 


Rochefoucauld, “there is more of self- 
love than love to another.” The high-

happiness of its.object more than any- 
thing else on earth, even if that bap- 
piness should be found in the love of 
another. 


I can hear the cynic asking if such 


a love ever really existed. I suppose 


he means between the sexes. Surely | 


mothers have often loved that wax. 
Mothers Often, Lovers Once in a Blue 
Meon. 

And I have faith to believe that hus- 
bands or wives sometimes have. I do 
not mean that one would not suffer 
intensely to see someone else put in 
one’s place. But might not one rise 
above the suffering to a height from 
which one could feel that all was well 
if the loved one was happy? 

There is a wonderful little poem by 
Sara Teasdale which describes such a 
condition. I think it is one of the 
most poignant little lyrics ever writ- 
ten, I have often wondered. how the 
lost love poems of Sappho could be 
any more wonderful. I hope some of 
my reader friends will love this as 
much as I do—I quote from memory: 


“When love comes singing to his heart 
That will not wake for me. 

I think that I shall know his joy 
By my own ecstasy. 


“But when he bends above her lips, 
Rejoicing for bis sake, 
My soul will sing a little song, 
But oh, my heart win break!“ 
Tomorrow—There Really Are Such 
Fathers.

Mr. Battle Will Speak 
On Lanier’s Work. 


Miss Carolyn Cobb will present Wil- 
lis Battle, her student in public speak- 
ing, in a lecture-recital on “The Life 
and Work of Sydney Lanier,” at her 
studio in the Grand at 3:30 o’clock 
this afternoon. 

Mr. Battle is well known as a 
young lawyer in Columbus, Ga., where 
he has practiced with his father, Charl- 
ton Battle. He is completing his law 
course at Emory university, where 
for the last two years he has taken 
the honors of the class. 

Mr. Battle will give a critical analy- 
sis of Lanier’s work, dwelling upon 
the adequate and harmonious ex- 
pression of the spiritual idea in his 
poetry. He will illustrate his talk 
with an interpretive reading of “Sun- 
rise, “The Marshes of Glynn,” The 
Crystal,” and other selections from 
Lanier’s poems.

or good taste to realize that she had 
tried to.frustrate his wish. ;

Very well, said the children, give

superior in appearance to their elders

The mud-colored caracul coat lav- 
ishly heaped with black wolf or fox 
is so ubiquitous in New York that 
one rather tires seeing it in the shop 
windows as well as on women, and 
the observer wonders just why this 
special kind of street coat should 
have rushed the season and repeated 
itselk until one believes every other 
woman has one, or has her eye on one. 
Like coats of dyed muskrat. they fill

They like black velvet and they 
think dyed lamb’s wool is the high 
water mark of fashion. It is so gay 
to go about with a muffler collar 
with a long end, a tiny muff and 


‘| sometimes gauntlets of curly red or 


glaring green fur. It's something like 
carrying the pet lamb to school with- 
out a rebuke from the teacher. The 
very fact that it is the hide of a lamb

if it was the hide of a big wolf or

red and black. The former is velvet 
and the latter is dyed lamb’s wool, 
a fashion which grows in favor for 
children. 


Like the adults, the majority of 
youngsters have discarded the sur- 
plice collar on a coat just as the diag- 
onal line across the chest is coming 
more and more into fashion for coat 


suits and tailored frocks, in an at- 


tempt to make women release the 
bateau neckline which has exhausted 
the patience of the designers. What 
they wear instead of the surplice 
collar is a high choker affair, the kind 

women are adopting for their 
wraps for street and evening. Women 
omit the stole end that the dress- 
makers give to children and the latter 
insist that it reach the end of their 
short skirts.

are pleasantly called by those who 
deplore their vogue are creeping into

Applied Education, 

The early part of the meeting was 
devoted to a brief session on the ap- 
plied education department of the fed- 
eration’s work. 

Mrs. W. B. Price Smith, chairman 
of the department, presided, and pre- 
sented several speakers who in brief 
talks exploited some of the most strik- 
ing work of the department. She call- 
ed first on Mrs, John K. Ottley, state 
library commissioner, who explained 
that although Fulton county is the 
largest and richest and most populous 
county in the state, and has the larg: 
est city library in the state it has no 
county serving system.

Mrs. Kose V. 8. Berry, chairman department ot tine arts, General 
Federation of Women’s Clubs, who addressed city federation Thursday, 


to the county, she stated, as is the 
case in other communities, if the 
county commission would make an p- 
tropriation to Carnegie library, which 
would pay for this extension of serv- 
ice. The library is willing to take on 
this extra responsibility. Mrs. Price 
Smith, she said, is going to make the 
first effort to secure this extension by 
asking the ‘county commission for an 
appropriation which would supply 
the community in the section in which 
Cheshire school is located, the school 
being used as the extension center. 
The federation was asked to lend its 
aid for a broader extension. 

The applied education work in the 
Atlanta Women’s club is the most ex- 
tensive in the state, stated Mrs. T. T. 
Stevens, and she announced that a 
movement is about to be started for 
the introduction of humane education 
fn the schools. Mrs. Helbig reported 
the excellent work of the Buckeye 
Woman's club, the recent gift of 8500 
for “Tallulah Falls school from the 
Nineteenth Century History class was 
reported the splendid work of the 
Witches’ club, and the work of the 
Music club, which is all educational, 
was cited by Mrs. Charles E. Dow- 
man, the president. She asked for 
co-operation. in making successful the 
children’s concert the latter part of 
January by the Cincinnati Symphony 
orchestra. 

I rtant features of the business 
session included the confirmation of 
the action of the executive board in 
the election of Mrs. Joseph N. Moody 
as third vice president of the feder- 
ation and the passage of resolutions 
offered by Mrs: Thornton and read by 
Mrs. Alonzo Richardson, indorsing the 
national campaign for an extension

HOW WINGS ARE MADE 


In one small bag of rousted peanuts | 


there are enough camels and dogs and 
birds and rabbits and little pigs to 
start a menagerie, and just crowds of 
queer little people. S. erp eyes and a 
little imagination are all that is need- 


Our artist has shown in his picture 
how, with the aid of toothpicks, ink, 
some tissue paper and cardboard, pea- 
nuts of various shapes may be trans- 
formed into all these things. 

The wasp is made of two peanuts, 
one for the fore part and the other 
for the back part of its body. The 
two parts are fastened together with 
a short piece of toothpick stuck into 
holes in the ends of the peanuts. 

Toothpicks for Legs. 

Six toothpicks are used for legs. 
These are bent and cracked and then 
carefully stuck into holes in the sides 
of the fore part of the body, three 
legs on each side. 

And, of course, a wasp must have 
a stinger. So, make a small hole in 
the end of the back peanut, and in- 
sert a pin, head first. You may use 
this stinger to convince skeptical 
friends that your wasp is the real 


thing. Have them press their fingers“ 


on the point. 

The wasp’s wings are made of tis- 
sue paper, folded and cut after the 
pattern shown. They are glued to the 
top of the front part of the body. And 
then, using black ink, paint the wasp's 


eyes and stripes. 
"Place a drop of water on the joint 


of each of the wasp’s legs and see 

what haprens.

Who's Who in the Story. 
Jeanne (Jane) Dare, beautiful, 
clever, but poor, resolves to stake 
e to achieve a wealthy mar- 
riage and, after raising all thé mouey 
she can through mortgages, savings 
and borrowings, aided unwillingly by 
Henry Harrison, her childnood 


|} sweetheart and hopeless suitor for her 
hand, comes to New York, where she 


believes eligible-men are to be found, 
and establishes herself as a woman of 
wealth and fashion at one of the 
smartest hotels, where she meets 


Richard Canby, a wealthy broker 
and man about-town, who is attracted 
by her beauty and introduces her into 
bis set, in which are 


Adele Parkinson, a young. widow, 
former flame of Canby, who befriends 
Jeanne, and 

Victor Barstowe, young, handsome, 
debonair, only cen of a multimillion- 
aire, whom Jeanne marks as her prey. 
Barstowe is instantly attracted, and 
comes to tea when Jeanne persuades 
Signor Bonnicetti, a famous Italian 
violinfst, also smitten, to play for her 
guests. Harrison arrives unexpectedly 
with the news that he can raise no 
more money on her worthless property 
in Iowa; but, impelled by his ho 
less love for her, he buys it with his 
lifelong savings. Jeanne, ming 
fearful of her capital, is persuaded by 
Canby to play the market just before 
she leaves for a week-end party, at 
which Barstowe is to be a guest. She 
wins, but has her hopes of landing 
Barstowe temporarily shaken by 

Vera Dayton, a lifelong acquain- 
tance, whom his family openly favurs. 
Barstowe, however, asks Jeanne to 
marry him. . 


Installment No. 25. 


WITHIN 
HER GRASP. 

Jeanne was amazed at her own pvise 
when she listened to Barstowe’s words 
which meant the fulfillment of her 
great ambition: Jeanne, I love you! 
Will you be my wife!“ 

She had often wondered how she 
would meet the crisis in her career; if 
she would have the stamina to avoid 
the betrayal of her exultation. 

To her surprise, she discovered tnat, 
beyond the sense of satisfaction which 
one experiences when one’s carefully- 
laid plans have succeeded, she felt no 
thrill. Perhaps it was because she 
had been so sure of success, whether 
it was Barstowe or any other man. she 
though waited quietly, respectfully, 
of an overmastering ambition is tame 
in contrast with the scheming and 


loyal members, in the tragic death of 
their brother and son, Remsen King, 
proposed a minute of silent tribute, 
which was closed with a prayer by 
Mrs. Ulric Atkinson. 

On the stage with Mrs. Thornton 
and Mrs. H. G. Hastings, the secre- 
tary, were Mrs. Ulric Atkinson, Mrs. 
Arthur Harris and Mrs. Joseph 
Moody, vice presidents; Mrs. Emma 
Garrett Boyd, chairman of the depart- 
ment of fine arfs, whose introduction 
of Mrs. Berry, while impromptu, was 
most graceful, and Anne Milo Up- 
church. 

Child Life in Europe. 


Miss Upchurch, one of the foremost 
American painters of child life, was 
a distinguished guest, and an inter- 
esting speaker, She told something of 
child life in che Balkan countries 
through ber experiences there on the 
occasion of her tour since the armis- 
tice when she sought subjects for her 
sketches of ‘child life in the devas- 
tated countries of Europe, these paint- 
ings her gift to the American Red 
Cross in its educational campaigns 
— funds to feed and clothe these chil - 

ren. 

An exhibit of the work of Miss Up- 
church is hung in the adjoining hall, 
and after the meeting was viewed with 
the twofold interest due its artistic 
value and its worth to the junior work 
of the Red Cross in Europe.

Mrs. Thornton recited briefly the 
various movements, national, state and 
local, in which she has been invited 
to participate on account of her office 
as president of the federation, these 
in their variety. revealing. as Mrs. 
Thornton said, that the federation 
touches life at every point. 

At the close of the meeting an in- 
formal reception was held, when the 
city federation was hostess to the Art 
association and the Atlanta chapter,

Upchurch were the principa] theme 
of interest.

Barstowe had bis band from 
her chin, but he still stood beside her 
chair, quietly awaiting his answer. 

Sue liked his reserve. Se had ak 
ways dreaded the possibility of a 
maudlin display of sentiment or (mo- 
tion in the man she picked for her 
purely business like scheme. But. 
though he waited quetly, respectfully, 
for the word which would accept all 
he had to offer or send him away for- 
ever, she knew by the tense attitude, 
the controlled breathing that he was 
not_unmoved. 


Looking down at her slim hands, 
folded in her lap, she said hesitat- 
ingly : 

Jean surely be pardoned if I say 
that this is—sudden.” 


He made a negative gesture. 

“Not to me! I knew 1 was going 
to love you the first minute I saw you 
at Canby’s dinner. ‘The marvel is 
that I didn’t tell you before. I am 
amazed at my own restraint.” 

Jeanne smiled slightly. 

oe you know why you—care for 
me!“ 

“Hardly,” he replied. Can anyone 
analyze love? It exists or it doesn’t, 
and not even the greatest seer on 
earth can tell us why. ep. ’ 
I could say, of course, that it is be- 
cause you are very beautiful; or be- 
cause you are very clever. But I 
have known beautiful and clever wom- 
en before, and they left me cold. Per 
haps,” he smiled boyishly, perhaps 
it is bevause you are erent. 
Though, of course, you are different 
because 1 love you. .So you see, my 
reasoning progresses in a circle.’ 

Jeanne said slowly: 

“But if | am—different—from the 
women you have known, you would 
grow tired of that very alien quality. 
We like difference in our friends, but 
in a closer relationship—” 

He broke in impatiently. 

“Must we discuss the abstract? My 
love is a very concrete thing. ‘The 
fact that | want to marry you is defi- 
nite. You can scarcely blame me 
if I am slightly impatient.” 

“But you must give me time! 1 
must think!” protested Jeanne. 

She rose and brushed by him. He 
made no effort to stop her, but his 
eyes followed her as she trailed glow- 
ly to the window and stood leaning 
against the frame, looking down on 
the avenue traffic. 

She feit his eyes. She knew they 
were burning with a brilliance she had 
never seen before. But she also knew 
that in her misty white draperies 
against the dark Velvet curtains, she 
made a charming picture. 

Inwardly she was amazed at der- 
self. That she dared to keep him 
waiting! Wealth lay in her grasp~ 
and she looked out at the avenue traf- 
tic! 

It was the last hour of sunlight in 
the short winter afternoon—the gayest 
hour on the avenue and in the park. 
The sidewalks were filled with 
smartly dressed people. Countless 
motors formed a torpid serpent that 
wound its way slowly down the street 
as far as her eye could see. Across 
the corner of the park, the waning 
sun shoné on stately marble edifices 
where the afternoon parties of the 
wealthy were in pro

walk, and the flash of silk and turs

New York! It was hers! She had 
not been wrong in thinking she would 
win! Now, she was a part of it, a 
counterfeit no longer! e of those 
stately houses on the avenue would 
be hers. There would be no motor 
in that crawling serpent superior to 
hers. . . And she could keep 
Barstowe waiting until she spoke the 
word that opened the gateway to this 
glittering future! 

She smiled inwardly at the irony 


of it. 

„Well?“ Barstowe prompted finally. 

Game to play her ha cleverly 
till the last, she turned around to 
face him, her eyes troubled. 

“You’re quite sure you ought not 
to think this over longer?’ she ques- 
tioned. “Remember, you don’t know

few times.” 

He smiled lightly.

of her indifference more securely about 
him, and then reluctantly—very re-

There was no mistaking the signifi-

ture of surrender with which she 
stretched out her hands. 

In a single stride he was beside her, 
and, though she seemed to shrink a 
little, he gathered her closely in his 
arms and held her gently, looking 
down into her eyes with his brilliant 
gray ones. ; 

“You don’t love me now, sweet- 
heart,” he said a bit huskily, “but I 
am going to make you love me some 
day. Say you'll marry me.” 

Jeanne raised her mouth in answer, 
her eyes closing 

She was surprised to find his lips 
— a distinctly pleasurable sen-

» CHAPTER X. 

From Ambush. 
Day was breaking when the recov-

*?valley. Markham and his companions 
vent with them, but under the vigi-

through Raining Rock Pass; a thaw

The ranchman wrinkled his brows. 

“You were looking for some one,” 
he said, seeming to recali the fact+ 
with difficulty. “You thought we 
might know something of him over 
here. 

J did,“ Cooper answered, and I 
do. The man I was lookin’ for had 
his right hand shot up, and I’ve since 
learned you've got a party stayin’ 
here with some such difficulty. His 
name is Norman Hoyt. I want to ask 
him how he hurt his hand.” 

If Camberwell was an actor he was 


a good one.

They came in sight of Camberwell's

“That would have been a serious

is here; he has been Here for some 
time and it is true that his hand is 
hurt, but I never connected him with 
your search. What reason could he 
have had for shooting Holley?” 
That's for him to say,“ Cooper ans- 
wered shortly. 


When Camberwell got up to call the 


Chinaman, there was a curious smile 
on his face. One would have said that 
the predicamentin which Hoyt feund 
himself offered some subtle amuse- 
ment to Camberwell. He sent the 
Chinese servant after Hoyt and pre- 
tended to make light of the sheriff's 
mission, 

When Hoyt came in presently a 
young girl, whom Cooper knew must be 
yeraldine, followed him and stood 
timidly near the door. She was pale, 
and looked anxiously from one face 
to another, 

Hoyt’s manner was blustering when 
he heard the charge against him. He 
glanced at Camberwell, trying to pene- 
trate the mask the other wore, but 
finding nothing. 

“You win,” he said to Cooper with 
a sneer. L'Il go with you, if only to 
prove how wrong you are. My hand 
was hurt in a baling machine and 
any doctor will swear to that.” 

But Geraldine, who had listened to 
the interview without understanding

she cried eagerly. “Oh, when they 
said that you were here 

“I made out that you might want 
to come along,” he returned gravely. 
“Your horse is ready, but you better 
get a warmer coat than that.” 

“Oh, no, no,” she shuddered. “Not

again.” 

His eyes turned to blue steel. 
Why?“ he demanded. “Has anybody 
bothered you?” 

“No, no; but they are taking my 
uncle away; and even with him here, I 
am afraid; afraid! There is a woman 
in there. She looks at me so strange- 
ly; so cruelly! And Camberwell, he 
wants me to stay.” She covered her 
face with her hands. 

“You won't stay,” said Billie brief- 
ly, and led her horse forward. 

With her face concealed against the 
horse’s mane, Geraldine began a 
trembling confession,

“But what of me!” she cried. “I

no other place. Iwill return in a few

“Why should you object, Miss Hoyt? 
The house is large, and you will be

But his reassuring words could not 
drive the white fear from her face. 

“Let me go with you,” she begged 
of Cooper. 

“Miss Hoyt,” the big sheriff ans- 
wered gravely, there's somebody 
waitin’ out at-the corral to speak to 
you. Billie Stranger’s out there, sad- 
dlin’ your horse. If you want to ride 
to Prosperity with us, all you got to 
do is to say the word.“ 

A light flashed into her face. 

“Billie! Here!” she cried; and ran 
past Camberwell, disdaining his at- 
tempt to stop her. 

He was there. She saw his tall 
figure distinct fram the other men 
who stood a little aloof: His name 
came to her lips and she did not try to 
hold it back. 

„Billie!“ 

He came to meet her with his awk- 
ward grace, moving leisurely as

Cooper with Hoyt and Camberwell 
came out of the house, and a man led 
the sheriff's horse from where he had 
left it in front of the building. Cam- 
berwell’s outfit watched the four’ of 
them ride away without lifting a hand 
or voice to detain them. There was 
something ominous in such inaction. 


though they had the day before them. 


— 


“It won't happen on his land,“ said 
Cooper, voicing the thought that was 
in Billie’s mind. “We got to ride, 
sure enough, after we cross his line.” 

They did ride, Billie and Geraldine 
in the lead, and Cooper and Hoyt close 
behind. The sheriff, with eyes in the 
back of his head, kept a weary watch 
on the buckbush that grew to the edge 
of the trail, and Billie watched, too, 
as the rapid pace ate up the distance 
and every yard brought them nearer 
safety. They were on the Prosperity 
trail, wide and fairly well traveled; 
it seemed that they must be safe here. 

“We'll soon be outa this brush and 
in the open,” said the sheriff. “I reck- 
on they won’t waylay us there.” 

But Cooper was never to pass the 
brush. Just as he spoke, from a clum 
of heavier growths there came a puff 
of white, delicate smoke and the sing- 
ing whine of a rifle shot, faint but 
startlingly clear. Cooper fell from 
his horse without a word, and the ani- 
mal leaped to one side, then galloped 
wildly back into the trail, his reins 
hanging. 

As the sheriff fell, Billie’s hand flew 
out and grasped the rein of Hort’s 
horse as it crowded past him; his mind 
acted with a sort of lilghtning conti- 
nuity, anticipating ‘every move of this 
ambush. He had known it was wait- 
ing for them somewhere along the 
trail, and so had Cooper; he knew 
that they would try to get him next. 

Poor Cooper lay face downward in 


the trail and it was easy to see that] Geraldine’s figure, but Hoyt. puzzled 


trampling hoofs and melting snow and 
the whine of bullets over his head 
made no difference to him. Billie 
wheeled his horse between the other 
two, though Hoyt, cursing, made fran- 
tic efforts to escape. Geraldine, after 
her first ery, made no sound but kept 
close to Billie’s side. 

“We got to make the Pass,” said 
Billie under his breath. 

Little Britches slept outside that 
night for an hour or two, but that was 
nothing; many times she had chosen 
the stars in prefernce to her father’s 
roof. The outlaw horse stood quietly 
as she left him. He did not resent her 
mastery, for she was a wild thing like 
himself, The night might have seen 
her far on her way, but the time had 
— yet come for her to leave che val- 
ey. 

From where she lay cudled in her 
oil blanket she could see the Camber- 
well ranch houses beginning to take on 
life as the early light became day. She 
kept her eyes on the trail and pres- 
ently she saw Billie Stranger and the 


sheriff riding toward Camberwell’s, |‘ 


just as she knew she would. 

“He’s gone to get her,” muttered Lit- 
tle Britches, with a remnant of passion 
flaming into life. He let me go an' 
never called me back, but he’d go into 
hell for her.“ 

After a while she saw the group of 
four as it was separated from the con- 
fusion about the corral. She discerned

her for a moment before she identified 
him. Then she frowned anxiously. No 
one knew better than she that the ease 
with which this captyre was made was 
far more ominous than open rebellion 
by Camberwell. She knew his ways 
and that no one entered or left the 
valley without the espionage of his 
men. From some part of the deep- 
brushed area eyes were watching: 
there would be a signal from the ranch 
and presently the ambush would be 
sprung. Crouching in her own secret 
place, she turned her eyes from the lit- 
tle group whose progress seemed so 
slow from this distance. 

“Injun signs!” 

A thin spiral of smoke appeared 
from a point beyond . Camberwell’s 
house. It was written against the sky; 
then lost in the yellow sunlight. This 
would be the signal to those who lay 
concealed somewhere between the little 
party and safety. After that she never 


took her eyes from Billie’s figure, rid- 
W. Geraldine in advance. 


The cry was wrung from ‘her in 
spite of self-control. The rifle shot 
that sent Cooper from his saddle eame 
to her ears like the popping of a toy 
gun, but she saw the tragedy with a 
strained gaze that missed no detail. 
Her fingers clutched a jagged rock and 
the nails were bleeding a little where 
her desperate grasp bruised them, but 
she did not feel the hurt. When she 
looked again she saw three horses in- 
stead of four, galloping toward the 
hills where she lay hidden. Billie was 
making for his own country and he 
was bringing Hoyt with him. 

A broken group of riders came from’ 
cover and scattered over the plain. but 
from the first Billie Stranger had the 
advantage, for they were hampered by 
the heavy brush through which they 
must pass before they could reach the 
comparatively easy going. It wasa 


silent battle, for a time, or ho not 
of men, for not a shot was 9 
Little Britches knew that Billie would 
have been the target for a dozen shots, 
but for his proximity to Hoyt and Ger- 
aldine; Camberwell had no intention 
of injuring either of these. 

She flung herself into her own sad- 
die, and I B Dam gave a plunge that 
sent rocks and gravel raining down the 
slape, but his rider was in no mood for 
coaxing, and her will drove — to 
blaze his own trail where no horse had 
ever gone before him. Her quick eye 
measured the distance between Billie 
Stranger and safety. It would not be 
long now until the Pass swallowed 
them up, and even Camberwell’s men, 
determined upon his death, would hard- 
ly dare follow him to the other side. I 
B Dam climbed steadily. It was her 
plan to reach the top of Raining Rock 
and from there to witness the end of 
the chase, herself unseen.

Cool Proves i Easy Before 
1 5 Mastery of Frenchman 
Conquered by Champion 


Dempsey. : 


* 
— 


London, January 12.— Georges Car- 
pentier came back when he knocked 
wit George Cook, the Australian 
heavyweight, in the fourth round of 
their fight scheduled for twenty 
rounds before a great gathering at 
the Royal Albert hall here Thursday 
night. 2 
The fight was aN as a test of 
Carpentier's condition, to reveal 
whether be had been permanently 
weakened by the body-punching he re- 
ceived from Jack Dempsey in their 
fight at Jersey City last July 2. 

Carpentier by his knockout of the 
tough Australian challenger, retained 
his title of heavyweight. champion of 
Europe. His title of light heavyweight 
champion of the world was not at 
stake, as Cook scales above the 175- 


pound figure. 
Cook, with no very formidable rec- 


uilt up” to a

xer of al- 


_ord behind him, was b

some English sportsmen as sufficiently 
durable to take Carpéntier’s hardest 
punches and remain strong enough to 
wear down the Frenchman in the later

none the worse for

Cook surprised the crowd and wor- 
ried. Carpentier by winning the first 
two rounds. This he accomplished by 
me a i in cloge and hammering with 
both fists at Carpentier’s body. Two 
hard lefts to the body worried the 
Frenchman in the second round. 

After that, Carpentier refused to 
“trade” with Cook, but boxed him at 
long range. In the third round, Car- 
pentier’s foot work began to show, and 
his aim, which had been bad, as evi- 
denced by his missing several punches 
in the first two rounds, began to im- 
prove. The third was Carpentier's 
round. 

Coming out for the fourth, the 
French boxer missed two leads to the 
head. Cook stepped in and swung a 
had right, which clouted Carpentier 
on the ear and shook him. Apparent- 
ly angered by the blow, Carpentier

Staton Describes Pleas- 
ures of Playing on Open 

Court With Tempera- 
ture Near Freezing. 


BY JOHN STATON. 

The Tech team gets off today at 
10:55 o’clock from the Brookwood 
station. This will be the start of the 
first invasion of Alabama. Just how 
successful that invasion will be, we 
have no way of telling, but if we are 
i, take in any of the rumors that we 
hear floating around, both games will 
b; very close, and it would not be such 
a great surprise if Alabama should get 


- the verdict in the first games. 


By dope, Alabama stands a better 
chance to win than the Birmingham 
Athletic club, since Alabama ‘defeated 
the B. A. C. by a comfortable score 
not many moons ago. It may have 
been that the B. A. C. was not in prac- 
tice, or it may have been that Alabama 
just naturally had the better team. 
Anyway, the home team is up against 
something formidable tomorrow night. 

Quiet for Varsity. 

The varsity did not get very much 
to do at the practice’ yesterday. 
was most too cold to risk injuries 
from a scrimmage, so they had to con- 
tent themselves with a whole lot of 
goal shooting, and some hard and fast 
passwork. They called it a day early 
and beat it for thé showers, and left 
the other freezing urchins to the mercy 
of. the wind.

Tech Team Leaves for Ala. Trip 
This Morning; Nine Players Going 


FINE BATTLES 
IN S. S. LEAGUE 


The Agoga, basketball five of the 
Baptist Tabérnacle, Wesley Athletic 
club, of Wesley Memorial, and the 
Western Heights Baptist basketball 
teams were victorious in the National 
league, of the Sunday School Athletic 
association, Thursday night’ at the 
Y. M. C. A. 

The Agoga team ran up a total of 


56 points against 8 for the Central 
Presbyterian. five. The score of the 
second game was, Wesley A. C., 49; 
St. Paul, 11. The third game of the 
trio ended with Western Heights Bap- 
tist, 32; St. Luke’s Episcopal, 22. 

The Western Heights game was by 
far the best, due to an evenly matched 
five on both sides. The team work in 
this game was decidedly better than 
in any of the others. The Western 
Heights team showed great ability 
to pass accurately. They were very 
sparingly with their shots, and: rarely 
took a chance without scoring two 
points. Mott and Perry played the 
best game for the winners; Mott 
scored 8 points, while Perry scored 
13.. Echols, at center, also played a 
good game. The work of Dennicke 
was the best for the losers. He scored 
14 of his team’s 22. The majority of 
his shots were from long distance. The 
St. Luke’s team came back ‘in the 
second half with a score of 18 to 10 
against them and ran the score up to 
24 to 20, but then the Western 
Heights’ team suddenly came to life 
and pulled away. 

The Agoga team had practically no 
trouble in running up a large score 
on the Central Presbyterian team. 
They displayed more team work han 
was exhibited Wednesday night. Wil- 
kinson and Liddell were the stars on 
the winners’ side, while Russey and 
Smith played best for the losers. 

The Wesley team, composed of such 
stars as Lyle, former Tech High 
guard; Doyal, former Tech star; Me- 
Garrity, former Boys’ High star, and 
Dodge, formerly with the Atlanta Ath- 
letic club, had no trouble in running 
up a total of 49 points on the St. Paul 
team. The score at the end of the 
first half was, Wesley A. C. 35, St. 
Paul 3. 

The St. Paul team. fought gamely: 
throughout the game, but the stars 
on the Wesley team completely out- 
classed them. Wesley team dis- 
played very little teamwork, but the 
individual stars played well. McGar- 
rity scored 23 points for his mates. 
Doyal, at center, scored 8 points. Gif- 
ford played good ball for the losers. 


DECATUR HI SCRUBS 
TWICE VICTORIOUS 


The Fulton High school boys’ scrubs. 
were defeated yesterday afternoon by 


| the Decatur High scrubs, on the lat- 


ter's court, by the score of 22 to 4. 
The Decatur boys completely outp!ay- 
ed the visitors during every stage. of 
the game, the whole team sharing the 
honors. For Fulton, Stevenson and 
Yeager 5 well. 

The Decatur girl serubs were also 
victorious, beating the Fulton High 
scrubs by the score of 9 to 3. The 
game was fairly interesting, both 
teams playing their best.

SECOND GAME 
FOR HOWARD 


Birmingham, Ala., January 12:.— 
(Special.) — The Howard Bulldogs will 
play the second game of their season 
here on Saturday night with the State 
Normal team from Jacksonville. This 
will be the first real test of the Bull- 
dog strength, as the games with the 
North Birminghammers was nothing 
more than a practice affair, and the 
Howard five really did not get a 
chance to show its strength. 

However, Howard looked good and 
should make things interesting for 
every team that they will have to face 
this year. Shores and Crews looked 
like two of the best forwards that 
ever played with the Howard ‘five. 
Those two boys are not only demons 
when it comes to shooting the goal, 
but they can also step over the floor 
in a lively fashion, and are excep- 
tionally good men on the defense. 


NEED OF CHARTER 
_ REVISION SHOWN 


Continued from First Page: 


Watkins?’ ‘To which everybody a 
knowledged that they hadn't. Tr 
McClure’s Charter Views. 
During ‘the course of the discus- 
sion, C. W. McClure said that one of 
the best charters yet proposed was 


the one drafted by Dr. Hatton, of 
Cleveland, Ohio, for the Atlanta Cham- 
ber of Commerce. Mr. MeClure said 
that, from all he could find out, Coun- 
cilman Watkins had camouflaged his 
charter by rewriting Dr. Hatton’s 
charter. 
that the Dr. Hatton charter could not 
possibly have succeeded with the 
chamber of commerce as sponsor, and 
Mrs. J. K. Ottley, of the Atlanta City 
Federation of Women’s Clubs, said that 
Councilman Watkins, thinking that 
he would have more success by pro- 
posing the charter in council rather 
than out of it, had struck a snag and 
was doomed to disappointment for, 
she said, he will encounter just as 
fierce opposition in council. She also 
said that it would have more chance 
of success if presentèd to the people 
as the “Citizens’ Charter” than as the 
Watkins’ Charter.“ 


Mr, Meurs, en discussed the 
probability of thée Atlanta plan's suc- 
cess under the Sponsorship of Mr. 
Watkins. “Councilman Watkins,” 
said Mr. McClure, “is as fine a man 
personally as anybody could wish for, 
but the fact remains that he is not a 
good handler of men—in other words, 
* good politician. 4 observed that 

hen he was running for congress 
was defeated.” Mrs: — —— 
Boyd. of the Drama league, agreed 
with this statement of Mr. McClure’s, 

When Mrs. Ottley spoke of asking 
men closely connected with various 
municipal affairs to address them and 
tell them for certain whether the pres- 
ent government is wasting the peo- 
ple’s money, Mr. MeClure gaid that 
such action is unnecessary because of 
the fact that the city’s waste can be 
observed ‘by anybody. Take, for in- 
stance,” said Mr. McClure, the public 
comfort house which the city built on 
8 3 4 a cost of $45,000, 

cou ave en buil i 
$20,000." t easily for 

During the discussion relative to 
how a new charter plan could be 
placed before the people for voting 
and how a change in the present char- 
ter could be brought about, Mr. Me- 
Clure said that. there are a bunch of 

liticians and grafters“ who are un- 
11 terably opposed to change and are 
organized. What we want to do is to 
get organization,” said Mr. McClure, 
“because a handful organized can whip 
an army unorganized.” 
When the question, “What objection 
have you to the Watkins’ proposal?” 
was asked, Mrs. Ottley and Miss Tom- 
mie Dora Barker, librarian of Carne- 


would do away with the library board 
and place the libraries under the 
control of the’ board of education, 
which action, they said, would be un- 
fortunate, in that the board of educa- 
tion would not be able to handle the 
libraries, which need specialists, they 
claim. 

Relative to the future actions of 
the committee on discussing the char- 
ter, forming opinions on it, request- 
ing amendments, or, if need be, drafting 
an entirely new charter, the commit- 
tee decided to ask Councilman Wat- 
kins to address the next committee 
meeting Tuesday night in the Pied- 
mont hotel, and to ask Councilman 
Nutting to speak at another meeting. 
The proposal that both be asked to 
discuss the proposed charter change 
together at a committee meeting was 
not looked upon with favor. 

Mrs. Albert Thornton, president of 
the City Federation of Women’s 
Clubs, who was present, announced 
that the proposed federation meet- 
ing for the purpose ‘of discussing 
the charter has been postponed be- 
cause of the committee meetings. 

Others present at the meeting were 
Miss Eleanor Raoul, of the League 
of Women Voters; Mrs. George Var- 
don, secretary, and Miss Mary Dick- 
erson, of the Anti-Tuberculosis asso- 
‘ciation. It was announced that Je- 
rome. Jones, labor leader, was unable 
to attend the meeting because of a 
usiness engagement. we 

Other organizations affiliated with 
the committee, as given out by Mrs. 

ornton, are the Federation of 

des, Woman’s club, chamber of 
‘commerce, r cham of com- 
merce, college women, Associated 
Charities, Rotary, Civitan, Lions and 
Kiwanis clubs, West End Study club,

Declaration was then made 


gie, Stated that the Watkins’ proposal 2 


effort of all hands seems to be to 
make the rivalry between the two 


New York clubs of more importance 
than rivalry for pennants in the 
leagues. Both the American and Na- 
tional leagues have been guilty of 
assisting in strengthening New York 
clubs at the expense of others. It is 
quite natural for the leagues to want 
the advantage in New York, but in 
the rivalry between the two teams 
they seem to overlook the fact that 
there are fourteen other clubs bring- 
ing in money, and that close races in 
the leagues will produce not only 
healthier conditions but eventually 
more money than to have the Giants 
and Yankees drawing it all. 


A QUERY 
SW ERED. 

Joe Anton—Your query regarding 
Johnny Wilson-and his refusal to keep 
hi. contract with Tex Rickard to fight 
Greb in Madison Square Garden re- 
quires more than “yes” or no.“ 

Morally Wilson was entirely wrong. 
He signed a contract and agreed to 
fight, and broke it. His attempt to 
justify his act by saying he outsmart- 
ed” Rickard, and that Rickard de- 


two wrongs make a right. 

On the legal aspect of the case, Wil- 
son was entirely safe. It is a well 
recognized principle of law that a con- 
tract made under compulsion, or a 
confession’ secured in: thta manner, is 
not binding. Wilson would claim he 
was forced to sign the contract be- 
fore Rickard -would -pay him $37,000 
which ‘belonged to him, andthat he 
* merely to get what belonged to 

im. 

Regarding the act of the New Jer- 
sey commission in ordering Rickard to 
hold up Wilson’s purse, the commis- 
sion was entirely wrong, and far ex- 
ceeded its legal powers. The contract 


called for a boxing exhibition, prize 
fighting being forbidden. The: men 
went the limit agreed upon in the con- 
tract, fulfilling the contract. Whether 
it was satisfactory or not did not con- 
cern the commission, It had the power 
and the referee had the 
the exhibition, but permitted it to. go 
to the finish. 
It-could not hold 
| the charge that he 
fighting is forbidden.

Company Planned 


For Development 
Of Camp Gordon 


Plans for the formation of the Camp 
Gordon Improvement company, a 
$100,000 corporation, whose object 
will be the development of the Camp. 
Gordon and the adjoining property, 
were presented at the meeting of the 
Camp Gordon property owners at the 
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce assem- 
bly hall at 7:30 o’clock Thursday eve- 
ning. Judge Ernest C. Kontz, chair- 
man of the executive committee, pre- 
sided. 

Discussion of the proposed purchase 
f the power outfit took place, the 

lant and lines being offered at $12,- 
500. Judge Kontz of the committee 
of negotiations regarding street rail- 
way, electric light, water and sewer 


facilities, reported progress. The ne- 


was signed in New York state, and 


wer to stop 


cessity of preserving these utilities is 


of the greatest importance, according 
to Judge Kontz, who emphasized their 
direct bearing on the rapid growth 
of the proposed township. 

“It is strange,” said Judge Kontz, 
“that, while three of the railroad lines 
leading out of the city have substan- 
tial communities established within a 
radius of twenty miles of the city, 
such as Decatur, College Park and 
Tucker, that the largest line of all 
the only two track line, is without 
such a community near Atlanta.” 

The possible merger of Chamblee 
with the proposed community was ad- 
vocated, it beimg said that many ad- 
vantages would accrue from such a 
coalition. The principal advantages of 
such a union of the two communities 
would lie in the opportunity presented 
to use one water and electric lighting 
plant, as well as one system of sew-

Eddie Roush’s demand for $18,000 a year for a 
o | guarantee that he will receive the money whether he plays 
and other special demands, brings something of a crisis in 

It is rather a fortunate thing, not only for the sport, but for the 
niayers themselves, that Roush has made this demand. It calls for a 
showdown. Garry Herrmann has stated that he will not stand for the 
demand, and that Roush may stay at home if he persists in them. 

The demand of Roush is not only unreasonable, since he is not 
worth that much as a drawing attraction at the gate or as a ball player, 
but it is evident that it thinly veneers a desire to change clubs, and 
compel the Cineinnati club to sell him to New Tork. 

If Roush gets away with that (which he probably will not do with 
Judge Landis in charge), then the baseball club owners and managers. 
may as well turn over the sport and the business to the players. 
‘players are permitted to dictate, to select teams on which they will or 
will not play, the hope of good races in the leagues is over.

lacks the experienced veterans that 

have usually been in harness, yet the 

outlook is far from discouraging.” 
Many of the new men are showing up 

well, and the scrubs of last year’s team 

look ising. :

the Georgia’s two Sduth Carolina op- 
ponents; In past years both Clemson | 
and Furman have produced excellent

Black supporters are confident that 
Georgia will come out on the top of 
both affairs. ; 

Probable Line-Up. 

Coach Stegeman has practically 
picked the varsity team, and it will 
line up in its first game about as fol- 
lows: Paige Bennett, center; Raw- 
son and Murray, forwards; Clarke and 
Joe Bennett, guards. It is interesting 
to note that three of the five men 
also. made their letters in football. 

Both the team.and the students at 
Georgia are looking forward. eagerly 
to the coming S. I. A. A. tournament 
to be held in Atlanta. Consequently, 
the cage schedule has been made light- 
er than usual, so. that the Red and 
Black quintet will be in prime candi- 
tion for that event. Last year, Geor- 
gia was nosed out of victory at the 
tournament by the close margin of one 
point, and the team this year is de- 
termined that such a thing will no 
happen again. : 


1-YEAR RULE 
IS OPPOSED 


Danville, Ky., January 12.— (Spe- 
cial.)—Students of Center college 
voted unanimously against the rule of 
the Southern ee hey ees Athletic 
association prohibiting freshmen from 
taking part in athletics. After chapel 
exercises this morning, Ben Cregor, 
president of the senior class, called a 
meeting of the student body and took 
a vote on the question. 

Strong sentiment was also expressed 
among students for .George Colvin, 
state school superintendent, as presi- 
dent of Center, to take the place of 

r. W A. Canfield, who resigned sev- 
eral months since, to accept the head 
of Carroll college.at Waukesha, Wis. 
It was said, however, Colvin cannot 
accept the place, as he is not a member 
of the Presbyterian church. The col- 
lege boys voted to urge an appoint- 
ment at once. We want.a presi- 
dent,” they declared. 

‘A committee from the Centre board 
of trustees was named two months 
ago to select a president,-but no re- 
port of the committee has been made, 
and citizéns.of the gommunity, are be- 
coming anxious to have a strong man 
at the head of the institution. Dr. 
A. J. Alexander, Spring Station, is 
chairman of the committee, but has 
been quite ill. het,

SIGNED CONTRACT 


. OF JAMES’ REACHES 
WOODLAWN HIGH 


Birmingham, Ala., January 12— 
(Special.)—William Bell James, who 


fo. four years, has sent in his signed 
contract as director of athletics at 
th: new Woodlawn High school, ac- 
cording to a statement given out by 
Dr. C. B. Glenn, superintendent of 
educatio’, Wednesday morning. Coach 
James will arrive in time to take up 
his new duties January 30, the open- 
ing of the second term. 

Bill James comes to Birmingham 
with many fine recommendations as a 
g.ntleman and scholar. Charlie Mo- 
ran and Dr. W. A. Gansfield, presi- 
dent of Centre, praises his fine char- 
acter in glowing terms, Dr. Gansfield 
declaring that he is one of the finest 
characters that ever attended Centre. 

James turned down an offer in Cali- 
fornia to aecept the position offered 
him last November by Homer L. 
Thompson, head director of athletics 
in the Birmingham grammar and high 
schools. He spent several days here 
with Director mas, going over his 
work thoroughly at Woodlawn. 

Woodlawn is indeed fortunate in ob- 
taining a coach of such sterling quali- 
ti-s and his good influence is expected 
to mean much to the boys attending 
the new high school. Director Thomas 
promised the Woodlawn people that he 
would obtain the best man possible and 
in obtaining James -he has certainly 
lived up to his promise.

in the Oakland auditorium last night. 
One student, George Fortune, 22, was 
struck on the head with a night stick 
and probably fatally injured.

And, think of it, in 1907 the Rev. 
Simon Newcombe wrote: Inter- 
collegiate contests are worse than 
useless. Physical development on the 
part of our students will be best pro- 
moted by. entirely abandoning inter- 
collegiate contests. The intercollegiate 
football game gives an air of. respecta- 
bility to a spectacle which we should 
otherwise regard as undignified. There 
are two systems—one the German, de- 
voting itself to encouraging the 
healthy physical development of al 
students, and the other the promotion 
of spectacular games. It is like the 
difference between self-respect as an 
object in life and the desire to win 
the applause of others.” : 

Farther Views. 

Dr. Newcombe also recommended 
quieter exercising with dumb delle 
and gradually increasing the weight 
from 60 to 80 pounds. Quoting. him 
again: “In former times ~ cities, 
villages, nations and empires were so 
exposed to aggressions from their 


neighbors that not only their pros- 


perity, but even the lives. of their 
people depended upon the prowess and 
courage of their fighting population. 
The boy who possess physical. courage 
has a decided advantage over. his

_ Urge Support of Army

BY W. C. WOODALL. 


Jolumbus, Ga., January 12.— (Spe- 
ial,)—Pronouncing the progress made 
the development of the Camp Ben- 
ang Infantry school since his visit 
ere last June as “wonderful,” As- 
istant Secretary of War J. Mayhew

Nhe official said that he was thor- 

@ughly impressed with the necessity 
for such a school, train officers

rapidly as possible.

Tor this institution, and his strongly 
' eommendatory words and the earnest- 
= Jy approving comment by Mr. Wain- 
| wright made a profound and most 
| favorable impression upon the large 
audience of Columbus business men. 
Both of the two distinguished mili- 
tary officials said that the spirit of 
yperation as regards the infantry 
on the part of the business in- 
terests of Columbus was ideal, and

The fact referred to in more than 
one address was that “heavy weather 
' is ahead” for the army, and that it 

needs the active support of its civilian 
friends in a day when there is a 
strong disposition to reduce this 
' branch of the national defense to a 
point below the margin of safety. 
“If the army goes, your school at 
Benning goes,” declared General Har- 
bord, in a strong presentation of this 


dea, 

Colonel Malone declared that five- 
sixths of the American armies of 
the future would be made up of eiti-

Brigadier General W. H. Gordon, 
commandant of the infantry school at 
Camp Benning, near Columbus, is the 
officer standing. Colonel Paul B. 
Malone, to the right, is the assistant 
commandant. Both of the officers 
were congratulated by Assistant Secre- 
tary of War J. Mayhew Wainwright 
and Major General James G. Harbord, 
following a two days’ inspection. 


General Gordon is a veteran of three 
wars and has given continuous mili- 
tary service to the United States for 
more than thirty-eight years. He has 
risen from the ranks to major general, 
holding that rank on being assigned to 
the command of the Sixth division, 
August 26, 1918. He commanded that, 
organization in the Vosges and in the 
Meuse-Argonne operations. The sign- 
ing of the armistice found the general 
on the Verdun front. His army ca- 
reer has taken him far away from his 
southland and at one time he saw 
service in China. 

General Gordon has won many mili- 
tary honors. Twice during the Phil- 
ippine insurrection he was recom- 
mended for gallantry. He is the pos- 
sessor of the distingufshed service 
medal and two French decorations. 
the Legion of Honor and Croix de 
Guerre with palm. 

General Gordon was born in Wil- 
kinson county, Mississippi, June 24, 
863. His education carried him 
through thréeé southern institutions 
and two northern institutions, one be- 
ing the United States Military acad- 
emy. West Point. 

General Gordon is prominent in so- 


trained, so that the casualties be as 


light as possible. : 
eneral Harbord and Mr. Wain- 
wright completed their inspection of 


r 


cial circles at both Camp Benning 
and Columbus. He is an active mem- 
ber of the Charles 8. Harrison post, 
American Legion, and has done much 
to make the Columbus unit of the 
veterans’ organization one of the most 
active in the state. 

The general has taken an active 
part in eivic affairs, is a meniber of 
the Kiwanis club and takes great de- 
light in the achievements of “his boys” 
in athletics, recently accompanying 
the Benning basketball team to At- 
lanta. 

Colonel Malone rose to the rank of 
brigadier general in August, 1918, be- 


Ling assighed to command the Tenth 


brigade, Fifth division. His services 
in the great war won for him the fol- 
lowing honors: The distinguished 
service cross, the distinguished service 
medal and the French decorations of 
officer of the Legion of Honor and 
Croix de Guerre with two palms and a 
star. As commander of the Twenty- 
third infantry, Second division, he 
took a big part in the operations in 
the Somme-Lille sector, at Chateau- 
Thierry and at Soissons. 

As assistant commandant of the big 
infantry school he has had an oppor- 
tunity to bring into reality many 
dreams of what should be done to train 
this important branch of service. The 
younger officers at the infantry school 
see in the veteran of several wars the 
colonel serving in the Spanish-Ameri- 
can war, a real leader. Colonel Ma- 
lone, a native of New York, is a grad- 
uate of the United States Military 
academy and of various army schools, 
being an honor graduate of the army 
school of the line. | 

Colonel Malone, like the command- 
ing officer, is an active member of 
the Columbus post of the American 
Legion, and was one of- the Georgia 
delegates to the national convention. 
He did much with General Gordon 
last summer in entertaining the third 
annuat state convention of the legion 
meeting in Columbus. He is known 
in many army centers as “the orator 
of the army” and demands for his 
services at big meetings in Columbus 
and elsewhere have grown 80 nu- 
merous that o Armistice day he was 
called upon and delivered five speeches 
at Columbus observances. He is a 
member of the Columbus Rotary club. 


Benning and left this afternoon for 

New . From there they go 

to make an inspection of outposts 

along the Rio Grande, then yjsit west- 

ern forts, and return to shington 
. N. way of the central west. Mr. 
* ainwright declared that they wished 
to get in a closer touch with the 
‘various army activities than could 
be had from a swivel chair in Wash- 
ington.

RECEIVER & NAMED 
~ FOR INTERURBAN LINE 


Jonesboro, Ga., January 12.—(Spe- 
cial.) —Upon a bill in equity present- 
ed this morning to the judge of the 
Stone Mountain circuit by the trustee 
of the bonds issued by the Atlanta & 
Fairburn Railroad & Electric com- 
pany, J. L. Brassell, of Fairburn, was 
appointed receiver for the company. 

The Atlanta & Fairburn Railway & 
Electrie company is an interurban 
line, which was construeted about 
twelve years ago, and which operates 
a line of electric street railway be- 
tween Fairburn and College Park. 

The bill in equity alleges that bonds 
to the amount of $42,000 were issued 
and sold by the company five years 


ago, and that these bonds matured on 
January 1, 1922, and were presented 
for payment, and that payment was 
refused. 

The order appointing J. L. Bras- 
sell receiver for the company, directed 
the receiver to continue the operation 
of the lines of the company in the 
usual manner untib the further order 
of the court, and restrained the com- 
pany, its officers and agents, from 
interfering with or obstructing the re- 
ceiver in any manner. 

The petition was presented by Ar- 
thur Heyman, of the Atlanta law 
firh of Dorsey, Brewster, Howell &

Attorney Has Not Yet 
Decided Whether or Not 
He Will Continue Fight 
for His Client. ) 


Following the decision of the su- 
preme court Thursday denying a new 
trial to John 8. Williams, owner of 
the “Jasper county murder farm,“ 
Greene F. Johnson, attorney for Wil; 
liams, stated Thursday night that he 
has not yet definitely decided whether 
the case will be further contested. 

The supreme court is the highest 
tribunal which can ‘pass upon the 
case,” said Mr. Johnson. It can not 
be appealed to the federal courts, for 
there is no question of constitutional- 
ity involved. The only further re- 
course is to appeal for a new-hearing, 
and I can not say whether this will 
be our course until I study the test of 
the decision of Thursday.” 


_ Willimas, who was convicted 
in Newton county last April 
of murder in connection with 
the killing of 11 negro farm hands in 
his employ, must serve a life term 
in the state penitentiary, the supreme 
court Thursday handing down a de- 
cision affirming the verdict of a New- 
ton county jury in the case and u 

holding the ruling of Judge John B. 
Hutcheson, of the Stone Mountain 
cireuit, in overruling a motion for a 
new trial filed by Williams’ attorneys. 


Williams was convicted on the evi- 
dence given by Clyde Manning, his 
negro farm boss, who was indicted 
jointly with Williams in Newton coun- 
ty for the murder of Lindsey Peter- 
so. and Willie Preston, two of the 
negroes who were killed. According 
to Mannivg’s story, the two negroes 
were drowned, together with a third 
negro, Harry Price, in the Yellow 
river last March. The bodies of the 
negroes were found on the Newton 
county side of the river, about ten 
miles from Williams’ farm, which is 
located in Jasper county. 

Attracts Much Attention. 


When the case was tried at Coving- 
ton in April it attracted wide atten- 
tion throughout the entire country: 
Williams was represented by Attor- 
ney Green B. Johnson, of Monticello, 
as chief counsel, and Attorney C. C. 
King, of Covington, and Attorney W. 
H. Key, of Monticello. The state was 
represented by Solicitor-Genera] A. M. 
Brand, of the Stone Mountain circuit. 
Solicitor Brand was assisted by for- 
mer Congressman William H. Howard, 
of Augusta, who was employed at the 
direction of former Governor Hugh M. 
Dorsey, and by Graham Wright, for- 
mer assistant attorney-general. 


The story of the killing of the 11 
negroes forms one of the most grue- 
some incidents in the eriminal history 
of Georgia. The negroes killed were 
all former prisoners in the stockade 
at Macon and Atlanta. Their fines 
were paid by Williams and his three 
sons, Marvin, Huland and LeRoy Wil- 
liams, and were taken to Jasper coun- 
ty to work out the amount of their 
— on the farm of Williams and his 

ns. 


Last February, federal agents of the 
department of justice, eorge W. 
Brown and A. J. Wismer, began an 
investigation of peonage charges 
aainst Williams, They visited his 
farm in oy iy county and interviewed’ 
scveral of tho negro farm hands. Lat- 
er, 11 of the negroes disappeared from 
th: farm. Late in March the bodies 
of two negroes, Willie Preston and 
Linsey Peterson, were found in the 
Yellow river chained together. An in- 
vestigation was begun and Clyde Man- 
ning was arrested as an accomplice, 
Manning told his story to the federal 
agents and to Sheriff B. L. Johnson, 
of Newton county. Manning charged 
that he had helped kill and drown 11 
negroes and that he did so at the di- 
rection of Williams, who was present 
when dll were killed. He said he 
could point out where all the bodies 
could be found. 


Manning Tells Story. 


Accompanied by federal agents and 
the Newton county sheriff, Manning 
went to Williams’ farm and pointed 
ou where three negroes had been 
killed by crushing their skulls with 
an axe. He then took them five miles 
distant to a farm operated by Huland 
Williams, and pointed out two other 
graves. In one was found the body 
of a negro who had been told to dig 
a well and when he reached a certain 
depth was struck in the head with an 
axe wielded by Charlie Chisholm, at 
th: direction of Williams, it is claimed. 
Chisholm was one,of the negroes who 
was later drowned. Manning then 
took the officers to the Yellow river, 
where four bodies were found, and then 
to the Alcovey river, where two other 
bodies were found, making a total of 
11 in all. 4 
The negroes killed were Johnnie Wil- 
liams, John Brown and Johnnie Green, 
who mere killed with an axe in the 
pasture in front of Williams’ house; 
“Big John,” killed while digging his 
own grave: Fletcher Smith, who was 
shot by Williams, according to Man- 
ning’s story, and Willie Preston, 
Lindsey Peterson, Harry Price, Willie 
Givens, “Little Bit” and Charley Chis- 
holm, who were drowned in the Yel- 
low river and the Alcovey river. 


In his appeal for a new trial, Attor- 
ney Johnson claimed that the story 
of Manning was not admissible as evi- 
dence, as he was an accomplice. It 
was also contended that Manning’s 
evidence as to the killing of other ne- 
groes besides Peterson and Preston 
was not admissible at the trial, as it 
tended to establish the commission of 
distinct and independent crimes not 
eontained in the indictment under 
which Williams was being tried. Twen- 
ee specifications were filed in the 

The supreme court held that there 
was evidence to aythorize the verdict: 
of the jury and that the trial judge 
did not err in refusing a new trial. 
All of the justices of the supreme 
court concurred in the decision.

gilts, young boars and sows bred 
bring spring pigs sold and the prices 
ranged near $100 each. 

At an executive session, of the asso- 
ciation this morning there were many 
lectures on the best way to feed and 
handle hogs profitably. The main 
talk of the morning was by Dr. Peter 
F. Bahnsen, state veterinarian. He 
went into a general outline of the 
way to keep the herd healthy and 
thriving. A point of interest at the 
meeting was the large number of 
farmers of the county who joined thé 
association. 

At a banquet given last night all 
the visitors to the meeting were in- 
vited and a large number of speeches 
were made, among which were Dr. 
Andrew M. Soule, W. E. Price, Dr. 
Bahnsen, J. C. Williams, W. M. Traer 
and others. High tribute was paid 
by Dr. Soule —— Traer, of the 
Jacksonville Fa er and Stockman, 
and by J. C. Williams, of Washing 
ton, D. C., and to Editor Joe Law- 
rence, of The Wiregrass Farmer. 

They asserted that Mr. Lawrence 
had the cows to supply them. He 
state, and that he deserved a great 
deal of credit for the co-operation 
shown by Turner county farmers. 

One thing of especial interest was 
mentioned by Mr. Williams, who is 
with the development department of 
the Southern railway, when he de- 
clared that he was proud of the show- 
ing made by the Ashburn creamery. 
He advised against beginning too 
many creameries before the farmers 
had the cows to supply htem. He 
then referred to the experience of 
the packing plants with the one at 
Moultrie, the only one of half a dozen 
that had survived. He stated that 
it was not because this section could 
not support the plants installed, but 
there had been too many for the pres- 
ent development of the hog industry. 

In connection with the creamery 
and dairying work, a motion picture 
was shown late this afternoon of 
prize dairy cattle of the United States 
by the Quaker Oats company. A 
lecturer was with the picture to show 
the farmers and those interested in 
dairy cattle the best points about 
good cattle. Much interest was taken 
in the picture and the lecture given 
together with the talks on hog rais- 
ing is expected to be a great benefit 
to the farmers of the county. 

The next meeting of the Swine 
Growers’ association will be held at 
Griffin some time in March. Fitz- 
gerald gave the association an invi- 
tation to put on a show and sale in 
Ben Hill county on September 12.

New Lork, January 12.—The cotton 
market was unsettled again today. Ad- 
vances met increased offerings, but 
the sélling was not as active as earlier 
in the week, while there appeared to 
be a little more trade buying or cev- 
ering on declines, and the close was 
steady at a net advance of 3 to 17 
points, After selling at 17.98 early 
March contracts reacted to 17.78 later 
advancing to 18.04 and closing at 
17.88, compared with 17.82 at the close 
of the previous day.

: 


The market opened steady at an ad- 
vance of 8 to 13 points and the more 
active positions sold about 10 to 16 
points net higher right after the call 
on relatively steady Liverpool cables, 
better Manchester advices and talk of 
a firmer technical position. As March 
approac the 1s8-cents level offer- 
ings increased with the south a mod- 
erate seller, and prices broke late in 
the morning, with January selling off 
from 18.05 to 17.88 and May from 
17.59 to 17.40 or about 4 points net 
lower. 

The market then steadied on reports 
of a better tone in the stock market, 
and while there was another little 
flurry of. early afternoon selling on 
the reported resignation of the French 
cabinet, prices soon firmed up again 
on reports of a firmer spot basis in 
the southwest.- January advanced to 
18.10 and May to 17.65, making net 
advances of about 18 to 25 points on 
the general list. 

The announcement that the governor 
of Texag has created non-cotton-:pro- 
ducing zones in gests of Ellis, Gray- 
son, Collin and Liberty counties, in the 
ink boll worm, nad 
been very generally anticipated, but 
probably accounted for the relatively 
firm ‘ruling of October. Private re- 
turns indicating domestic — — 
of. 474,000 bales for December 

ed with the low record of? 000 
ast year, was considered more bullish 
than otherwise, although it showed 
some falling off from the Novetaber 
figures. There was New Orleans sell- 
ing on the closing reactions of 10 or 
15 points when the market was sensi- 
tive to comparatively small orders and 
general business was quiet.

HIGHER PRICES 
AT NEW ORLEANS |" 


New Orleans, January 12.—(Spe- | 
cial.)—Higher from the opening to- 
day, the cotton market had a complete 
change of complexion from what it has 
been wearing of late. Shorts furnish- 
ed a good part of the demand, covering 
to secure their profits; this was par- 
ticularly the case in the morning ses- 
sion, In the afternoon fresh long 
buying became a factor and on it the 
market reached its highest levels, 
showing advances of 27 to 33 points 
m the old crop. months. October at 
its best traded 20 points up, not show- 
ing the strength that the nearer 
months had. March went to 17.09 
and October to 15.85. On the close 
the list was at net gains on the day 
of 10 to 15 points, with March at 
16.91 and October at 15.78. 

A better Liverpool than expected | 
helped the market on the opening and 
the buying was continued on reports 
from Texas that the governor of that 
state had issued a proclamation pro- 
hibiting the planting of cotton in addi- 
tional areas in * counties where the 
pink boll weevil had been discovered. 
Toward the middle of the morning 
there were recessions of 10 to 15/8 
points, but the market came back 
again at midday on predictions of 
bullish week -end statistics. 

In the late trading reports of the 
resignation of the Freneh cabinet 
were regarded as a favorable develop- 
ment, and bullish traders commenced 
to take hold again on the idea that the 
resignation would clear the European 
situation.

N York, January 12.— Business 
on tHe stock exchange today was mod- 
erate in volume and lacking note- 
worthy features. The recent invest- 
ment demand for government bonds 
and other highgrade securities seemed 
to have temporarily run its course. 

Stocks were firm at the opening, 
reactionary during the intermediate 
period, and irregular later, when of: 
ferings. of oil, tobaccos, International

short selling. 

Rails, especially coalers, were the 
only stocks to manifest a degree of 
firmness or immunity from profes- 
sional pressure. Extreme gains of one 
to three points in that group were 
reduced at the close. 

Failure of the local Federal Reserve 
bank to order further reductions of re- 
discount and interest rates was with - 
out more than passing influence on 
money rates. Call loans again held 
at 31-2 per cent, and many new time 
loans at 4 2 to 43-4 per cent were 
reported. 

The resignation of the French cab- 
inet, in which the question of German 
reparations evidently figured, wcea- 
sioned some activity in remittances 
to Paris. Foreign exchanges, as a 
whole, however, showed little unsettle- 
ment, reactions in French, Belgian 
and German quotations being neutral- 
ized by the strength of Dutch, Swiss 
and Scandinavian bills. 

An unusual gain of reserve liabil- 
ities was the chief item of interest in 
the Bank of England’s statement, The 
report of the State Bank of Germany 
showed no change in its gold holdings 
and note circulation, but credits and 
deposits were substantially lower. 


Liberty bonds eased on realizing |. 


for profits, but closed at trifling 
gains and losses. Victory 33-4s at 
100.26 and the 43-48 at 100.30 made 
new high records for a long period. 
Many of the old-time railroad bonds 
were in demand, but foreign issues 
were irregular on latest developments 
in the French political situation. To-

chiefly owing to removal of hedges 
tgtinet sales of. 1,300,000 bushels of 
seed wheat taken for shipment to 
Russia. The market closed unsettled, 
varying from 34e net: decline to 7-8e 
advance, with May $1.11 1-2 to 
$1.11. 5-8 and July 99 1:4 to 99 3.8. 
Corn finished a shade to 1-80 higher ;

Studebaker Estimate. 

Studebaker officials estimate that 
the 1921 report will show a new high 
record in gross earnings at $95,000,000 
against last year’s high record of 
$90,652,000... Last year 68,500 cars 
were made, against the high of 90,652 
for 1920, and 5,385 for 1916. Or- 
ders are now on the books for delivery 
during the first quarter for 25,000 


cars expected to show 41-2 millions 
against the 21-2 earned for the last 
quarter of 1921. The company now 
has cash of between 8 and 9 millions 
with no bank loans. A year ago casn 
was $4,000,000 and some $500,000 
was owed the banks. Officials say 
that they are going to try this year 
for an output of 90,000 cars. 

Wall street hears that there is a 
good chance of Ford buying in the 
Lincoln plant at the auction in Feb- 
ruary and that he will use his many 
agents to sell this higher priced car. 

Union Pacific stated ‘oday that 
for the ten months of 1921 up to the 
end of October it earned $9.40 a 
share for its common stock. ‘Tobacco 
products stated that for the eleven 
months up to the end of November 
it earned 8.3 per cent for its steck 
against 7.79 for 1920. 

There was good buying in South-

General Electrics’ Offer. 


General Electric employees are be- 
ing offered the privilege of subscribing 
to fifteen-year 7 per cent debentures 
of the company dated November 1, 
1921. The bonds are in denomina- 
tions running from $50 up to $1,000, 
and each employee is limited to $1,000, 
to be paid for in cash or on the in- 
stalment plan. 

Wetern Union's earnings for No- 
vember show $8,164,000 gross, against 
$9,600,000 for the same period of last 
year; but with $9,056,000 for. October, 
and $9, 028,000 for September, of this 
year. November net was $1,202,000, 
against $1,116,000 a year ago. Hor 
the eleven months, gross was 
410,000, against 5110, 372,000 for che 
same period of 1920, and net $12,- 
179,000, against $15,647 000. These 
earnings, coming from all parts of the 
world, and from all lines of trade, ac- 
curately reflect general conditions, 

Yesterday a Boston anthracite coal 
dealer cut prices 50 cents a ton be- 
cause of the lower freight rates re- 
sulting from the withdrawal of the 
government tax ‘and other slight ad- 
justments. Today American can an- 
nounces that with tin plate now $4.75 
a hundred pounds against $12, the 
high war-time price, their 
prices have been reduced. This month 
the government will have eleven sales 
of surplus war supplies, having an 
initial cost of $12,000,000. Clothes, 
textiles, motors, leather, harness, ma- 
chinery and raw materials will be 
sold at something like 20 per cent of 
initial cost. During February there 
will be four sales of $8,000,000 worth 
of surplus supplies taken at original 
cost, one at Norfolk, on the 2d; one at 
Atlanta, on the 6th; one at Washi 
ton, on the Sth, and one at the Phil- 
adelphia, on the th. It is figured 
that the government has already sold 
81.240, 000,000 of property and that 
there is still a surplus of from 8400, 
000,000 to $500,000,000 worth of army 
ey se The selling of this surplus 

has been a tremendons factor in the 
general trade situation, and. business

Business men often do not consider seriously what may be 
called intangible assets and yet such assets form just as much 
a part of business success as those things that are more prom- 
inently in evidence. Take for instance, the quality and style 
of the paper and envelopes used in a business man’s corre- 
spondence, which either repels or attracts prospective cus- 
tomers in accordance with the taste exercised in its “get up.“

FOR. VIOLATIONS 
OF FEDERAL LAWS 


Four railroads came up for trial 
before Judge S. H. Sibley, of the 
United States federal court, Thurs- 
day morning, for alleged violations of 
the 28-hour law, relating to the time 
limit set on the number of consecu- 
tive hours in which a beast of burden 
may be required to work, and the serv- 
ice act, which sets the number of 
working hours for employees. 

For violation of the 28-hour law, 
the A., B. & A. railroad was directed 
to pay a penalty of $100. Two cases 
were made against the Southern rail- 
road on the same charge, and a fine 
of $100 was also imposed, Another 
case against the Southern railroad for 
violating the same law resulted in a 
$500 penalty. | 

Penalties of $2,300 for violation of | 
the act relating to the length of time 
employees shall be required to work 
was imposed .upon the Southern, as 
well as a penalty of $100 for infringe- 
ment o fthe act touching safety appli- 
ances. For. violations of the 28-hour

BODY TO PROMOTE 
POTATO RAISING: 
IN STATE PLANNED 


* are of officers, will adjo 


A meeting to consider organization 
of the Sweet Potato Growers’ Associa- 
tion of Georgia will be held in Atlanta 
at an early doth it is announced. A 
movement to organize this association 
is well under way. 

John Bostwick, of Bostwick, a lead- 
er in the movement, suggests that the 
association, after organization, secure 
promises of farmers that a certain 
acreage in potatoes be planted, and 
that a fee be charged those who join. 


| 


in giving instructions to members upon 
curing, grading and shipping potatoes, 
and placing them upon e market, 
Potatoes also may be sold, it is stated, 
to warehouses such as that at Monte- 
zuma and other south Georgia points, 
at which the highest prices for the 
product are paid. 

Mr. Bostwick states that when a 
sufficient number of counties have been 
organized, and an“ — of about 
100,000 or 200,000 acres pledged, the 
association will have a fund whereby 
itmay advertise and demonstrate to 
people unacquainted with the dietic 
value of the potato its virtues in this 
respect. He declares that the fund 
should be sufficient for sending repre- 
sentatives to ten or twelve of the 
largest cities of the north and east to 
push the sale of the Georgia potato.
