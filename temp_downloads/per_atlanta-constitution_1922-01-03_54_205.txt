DISSOLVED BY JUDGE 


Last Legal Obstacle in 
Way Removed After 
Hearing That Consumed 
Most of Morning. 


The bitter battle of months over 
the purchase of a municipal market 
site came to a victorious close for the 
market advocates Monday afternoon, 
when opponents of the measuré. fought 
in vain before the aldermanic board, 
losing 7 to 3. Ten minutes later Mayor 
Key approved the resolution, signed 
the check to buy the property, war- 
ranty deeds were made, the deal closed 
for half of the site at a price of $42,- 
500, and an option taken on the other 
half. 

Members of the Atlanta Woman’s 
club, the organization sponsoring the 
market plan, “witnessed approval of 
the measure, and Mrs, Norman Sharp, 
chairman of the club’s market com- 
mittee, claimed and received from the 
mayor the pen with which he affixed 
his signature. Mrs. B. M. Bovkin,

It was known in advance that 

strength of the market adherents was 


nearly two to one in the aldermanic | 
board, and when Judge John T. Pen-

“is a test of the soundness of preced-

the various federal reserve districts 
covering over half of the month show 
that this year’s demand in the east-

running as high as 10 per cent of that 
of 1920, while in other districts the 
situation is pronounced satisfactory.”

Captain English Provides 
Bounteous New Year’s

BY PAUL STEVENSON. 

Memories of the old “befoh de war”

night at the home of Captain James 
W. English, pioneer Atlanta citizen, 
former mayor, and chairman of the 
board of.directors of the Fourth Na-

association, and the renewing of ties 
which only will be parted by death. 
Old-fashioned dishes graced the table; 


candlesticks, lighted it, and quaint 
and characteristic ceremonies pervaded 
the atmosphere. 

All arrangements for the feast were 
made. by Captain English, but details

English’s personal servant, and Susap

Eager to Settle Limita- 
tions Differences in Or- 
der to Bring Conference 
to Early Close. 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 2.—While 
practically all the machinery of the 
arms conference” stood. still over .the 
New Year’s holiday, the unofficial del- 
egation of the Far Eastern republic 
took advantage of the lull to press 
their charges of a secret French-Japa- 
nese understanding for perpetuation of 
Japanese control if Siberia. 


that proof of their charges, already 
denied by both the French and Japa- 
nese delegates, could be obtained by 
examination of original dosuments in 
the archives of the Far Hastern gov- 
ernment at Chita. They ‘suggested 
that such an inquiry be made — by 
American consul officials, so that the 
results might be known to the confer- 
ence when it takes up consideration 
of Siberian problems. 

To emphasize the French public de- 
nial made yesterday, Albert Sarraut, 
head of the French delegation, formal- 
ly notified Secretary Hughes, as charr- 
man of the conference, that the 
charges were wholly without founda- 
tion in fact. 

May Ignore Charge. 

The French government, M. Sarraut 
said, in a written communication to 
the conference head, had entered into 
no commitments regarding Siberia ex- 
cept those of which the United States 
already was aware. 

In view of the French and Japanese 
repudiation of the charges and the po- 
sition of the Far Eastern delegates as 
| “outsiders,” sent to the conference by 
ah unrecognized government, the in- 
|clination in many conference circles 
was not to take the development very 


seriously. At the same time, the ac- 
cusations attracted widespread atten- 
tion and furnished a ready topic of 
discussion at a dull period in confer- 
ence negotiations. 

The naval experts worked through 
the holiday, giving their day to a. study

or indirectly connected. with his de- 
ore 

“The time has come to speak with 
opt-mism,” Mr, Bennett said. “With 
the coming of New Year’s Day I felt 
that I would be able to make a state- 
ment that everything is on the up- 
ward trend, and my reports, more-than 
justify me in saying this 

“I don’t look for any immediate 
boom, but do look forward to a steady 
upward trend, which will eulminate 
next fall with the farmers having 
plenty of money again and. with’ busi- 
ness men and bankers gig their 
old-time smiles.”

CITY FINANCES 


IN GOOD SHAPE 


Comptroller Reports the 
_ Balance $300,000 Great- 
er Than on January 


1, 1921. 


Atlanta’s - eomptroller isbursed 
_ through his office during 1921 the 


sum of $9,004,369.49, while the city’s 


collections during 1921 amounted to 
$%,314,773.65, according to the annual 
report of council's finance committee 
“Monday afternoon to council and the 
mayer. The report, which was pre- 
sented by Alderman J. R. Seawright, 
chairman, was accepted. 
The report shows that on January 
1, 1921, the comptroller’s balance was 
$539,376.37, while on January 1, 1922, 
the balance amounted to $849,926.15. 
The report declares that 1921 has been 
financially a banner year in the his- 
' tory of Atlanta. 
All Bills Are Paid. 
Other features of the report are 
that all bills due by the city have 
been paid, and that there are no ouf- 
standing obligations against the city 
‘which are due that have not been 
cared for. 
That the city ha» outstanding bonds 
Ta sum of $5,556, 
That“the sinking fund commission 
has, however, on hand $2,216,986.79 
Pe peevite for the payment on these 


in 


s, 

That in addition the city issued and 
‘sold during 1921 street improvement 
bonds to the amount of $294,000. 

And that therefore the net bonded 
indebtedness of the city is only $3,- 
739,513.21. 

That during 1921 serial sewer, wa- 
ter, schools and redemption bonds 
amounting to $131,000 matured and 
were paid. 

That $180,881.18 was paid in 1921 
as interest on all bonds and loans. 


And lastly that $304,417.69 was | 


taken from the current revenue of the 
city during 1921 for extraordinary ex- 
periditures because of the necessity 
of providing additional municipal 
equipment. 

Raise in Tax Rate. 


The report also discusses the raise 
in the city’s tax rate to 11-2 per cent, 
the increase in the school department’s 
Sagar ma from 22 to 26 per cent 
of the city’s revenue, and the inaugu- 
ration of the ten-year plan of street 
paving, the financing of which latter 
is done with the new plan of issuing 
street paving bonds. This last item 
“necessitated,” says the report, “per- 
fecting a system for srg, data 
for all ordinance, legislative and legal 
papers pertaining to same,’ and also 
perfecting an intricate accounting 
systemn for keeping the bond, sinking 
fund, interest and maintenance fund 
accounts, which, the report says, neces- 
sitate additional help to the city comp-- 
troller and to the collector of street 
improvements, which help is asked of 
council. 

The report closes by lamenting the 
shooting of B. Graham West, city 
comptroller, and declares that much 
credit should be given him for the 
efficient .work in the comptroller’s de- 
partment.

Thowands Shake 


White House Scene of Dem- 
ocratic New Year Recep- 
tion on Monday- 


—E 


— 


tinguished plenipotentiaries of 
Orient and the Occident had nothing 
on “just common folks” at the Har- 
dings’ New Year “open hause.” 

The reception Monday was a demon- 
stration of democracy, as followed at 
the white house. ‘Throughout the day 
thousands of people—men, women and 
children, black and  white—poured 
through the mansion. 

In the forenoon, when arms dele- 
gates, justices of the supreme court, 
the diplomatic corps and congressmen 
and senators, met President and Mrs. 
Harding, they were greeted, each by 
name and each extended New Year's 
greetings. 

In the afternoon, from until 4 
o'clock, when the “common folks,” 
their wives and their children and 
grandchildren, met President and Mrs. 
Harding, they, too, were each called 
by name and extended the greetings of 
the year individually. There were 
some four thousand of these every-day 
citizens, and they came away from the 
white house reception radiantly happy 
and forgetful of the zero weather. 

“Mr. Zero” Calls. 

If Urbain J. Ledoux, otherwise 
known: as “Mr. Zero,” expected to be 
stopped by the police and “gloriously 
frustrated,” he was disappointed, for 
the president greeted him heartily and 
presented Mrs. Harding, who respond- 
ed with eqhal grace. The same held 
good forthe thiry-five jobless ex-serv- 
ice men who formed Ledoux’s shabby 
retinue. 

In spite of the all-seeing eyes of the 
secret service men who “frisked” him 
in common with the rest of the long 
line of callers, Ledoux took his piece 
de resistance with him and smuggled 


it into the president’s palm. Its es- 
sence was “hail and tarewell,”’ with 
this prophecy at the end: 

“The tears of them that have fled 
from the drawn swords shall be wiped 


s)> 


the wilderness and solitary places shall 
be glad for them. ‘The desert shall re- 


there shall reside my peace, amidst the 
lion’s share, and the lambs and the 
child that leadeth them.” 


“Hard Times” Crowd. 


For the first timeinnine years the 

public had a chance to meet the presi- 
dent and his wife on New Year’s day. 
Those who recall the last reception 
under President Taft, have no remi- 
niscences of petitioners, such as Le- 
doux. 
And “Mr. Zero” typified the crowd. 
It was a “hard-times” crowd, plainly 
dressed, shivering in the cold, drab in 
its color and patient withal. Those 
who came first had waited more than 
three hours, and they were, for the 
most part, persons close to middle age. 
The atmosphere of continuous musie, 
red-jacketed marine corps musicians, 
liveried attendants and officers of the 
army and flavy in full dress regalia, 
did not impress t earlycomers. 
They eame to see the president and 
when he-greeted themt one by one they 
amiled gratefully, wef® content to pass 
out and remember thé day for more 
than a year to come. 


Every Name Called. 


For each visitor the Hardings had 
a pleasant word and a firm handclasp, 
Even as the closing hour neared, the 
grasp of neither the president nor 
Mrs. Harding weakened. Lieutenant 
Colonel Sherrill, the president’s aide, 
stood by and announced everyone’s 
name. Officers in the receiving line, 
solicitous for the welfare of the host 
and hostess, suggested that these for- 
mal introductions be abandoned after 
a thousand citizens had passed by. 
But the president would have none of 
it. All through the afternoon every 
man recefved a personal greeting, 
every woman an appropriate sentiment 
and eyery child a special attention, 

At least a thousand or more, trail- 
ing at the end of the line, four large 
blocks from the white house portico, 
were turned@away as the chimes in 
the white house grandfather’s clock 
intoned the “dead line.” 

But those who met Mr. and 
Mrs. Harding—and there were more 
than 2,000 of them—came away hum- 
ming strains of the martial music or 
keeping step, reluctant to leave the 


orchestras. They also wondered “how 
in the world the president keeps from 
getting tired shaking all those hands 
all day long.” ; 
Hand-Shaking Secret, 

The answer is simple: 
allowing the guest to shake his hand, 
the president shook the guest’s hand 
and thus eliminated the fatigueing 
equeeze that excited’ persons give 
when introduced. Mrs, Harding has 
learned the trick, too, although some 
months back she had not learned it 
and suffered a sore hand in conse- 
quence. 

All official calls to the contrary not- 
withstanding, it was the common peo- 
e’s day. Instead of gathring early 
efore the whitehouse gates to see 
the several official callers who came 
during the afternoon, as one would 
watch a brilliant pageant on the stage, 
they remained at home and waited 
their turn, conscious, no doubt, that 
they were a part of the program for 
the nonce. They also knew that they 
could see Arthur James Balfour “all 
dressed up,” Japanese and Chinese 
emissaries dressed for court cere- 
monies, and, members of our own 
congress and supreme court in silk top 
hat and broadcloth cutaway, in the 
movies,

VE OHSS AS 


The zoning plan for Atlanta as sub- 
mitted by Robert H. Whitten, consult- 
ant,: which was adopted by the city 
planning commission Monday, will be 
presented to city council at an early 
meeting, it was.indicated Monday aft- 
ernoon. 

‘The plan, a map of which was an 
exclusive feature of The Constitution 
last Sunday, was prepared after 
months of extensive research. 

Decision to ask council for $25,000 
with which to continue its work in 
1922 was made. A _ resolution re- 
questing the street railway company 
to co-operate in a survey of thorough- 
fares and traffic conditions was 
adopted. 
" Mr. Whitten, in discussing 
adoption of the plan, said: 

“Haphazard growth is wasteful, and 
inefficient and ugly as well. Zoning 
recently developed in a few of the 
most progressive cities of the country 
constitutes one of the greatest ad- 
vances ever made toward the applica- 
tion of common-sense methods to the 
building of the city. 

“New York, St. Louis. Newark, 
Rochester, Omaha and Washington 
and many smaller cities have adopted 
comprehensive zoning plans. At pres- 
ent almost every large city in the 
country that has not alreday adopted 
an zoning plan is actively at work 
upon such a plan.”

same interest in the welfare of the 
a were there on the part of the 
ost. 

Under such conditions, with such a 
host, one could roll back the curtain 
on a scene revealing the rolling hills 
of Atlanta, unmarred by, the scraggy 
skyline of a great city. Picture these 
lands as they were some 65 years ago— 
fertile farm lands, tilled by hundreds 
of slaves. Miles apd miles of fields, 
bearing their yearly bounty of white

Now this scene is bustling with life

Singing Old Songs. 
At Captain English’s Monday night, 


there were but a few of the old veter- 
ans left. No youngsters, no dancing 
and frolicking, no fiddlin’ and no plan- 
tation comicalities.. But there was 
singing of the old songs, the old “Sweet 
Chariot,” swung low, and there was 
“Shouting All Over God’s Heaven.” 
There were old tales to tell, and old 
jests to. jostle the merriment ‘and 
laughter along, as the old. servants, 
with many rheumatic grunts and sed- 
entary twists, /flickered in the shadows 
of the forgotten days of the “old

it could refuse at its own will. Mr.

would neger be built. ~

only the most hearty spirit of co- 
operation has been met with in the 
committee’s efférts, and that -this is 
particularly true with regard to our 
three daily newspapers. ‘ 

It is the earnest desire of the asso-

Atlanta shall become a member ‘of 
the association and the following com- 
mittee on welcome was appointed to 
see to it that they be acquainted with 
the purposes of the asseciation and

Dr. L. O. Bricker and Rev. J. S. Me- 
Lemore. 

Resolutions Passed. 


The following resolutions 


passed : 

Whereas, during the year 1921, the three 
daily papers of Atlanta have greatly aided 
the work of the churches of the city by 
the publication weekly of the news letter 
of the committee on church co-opration, and 
a page devoted to religious news: 

Whreas, at other times, notably during 
the present crisis of unemployment, these 
papers have generously gievn space and 
editorials in order to get the people of our 
city to help to bear the burdens of those 
whose wants would be known only te a 
comparative few, if it were not for the 
pages of. our papers carrying the news of 
the need to the homes ard firesides of 
Atlanta; and, we have seen the good accom- 
plished by this; and, 

Whereas, these papers Have been and are 
a great force in molding public opjnion 
and building up the city of Atlanta, 

Be it resolved, that: 

1. We, the Evangelical Ministers’ Asso- 
‘viation of Atlanta, go hereby .express to 
The Atlanta Constitution, The Atlanta 
Georgian, and The Atlanta Journal our 
great appreciation for the assistance given 
in our work. 

2. We wish for the three papers the 
happiest and most prosperous of New Years, 

in which they may receive a generous

Nashville, Tenn., January 2.—The 
police in their investigation of the 
de:.th of Dr. Hugh B. Smith, found 
dead in a local hotel on December 
26, with a bullet through his body, 
have located a hotel patron who heard 
the shot and other sounds, to indi- 
cate that the deceased did not shoot 
himself. 

Claude Adams, of Dickson, Tenn., 
came here this afternoon and told the 
authorities that he ueard what seem- 
ed to be a quarrel in the hotel room 
occupied by Smith, then a shot fol- 
lowed by an exclamation: “I am 
shot,” and a thud as of a body fall- 
ing. After a short period of silence, 
he says, two voices wer. again raised 
to an angry pitch, one of them ap- 
parently that of a v oman.

3. We pray that, throughout 1922 and 
beyond, God may guide their editors in 
shaping and making public opinion and 
their reporters in gathering news, #0 that

into thousands of homes ‘not only in At-

may always carry the ‘“‘zood news’ and ad-

these could absorb a portion of the

SHOWN BY sve 


Sh RE a John A. Boykin’s 
report for the November term of 
court, which closed Saturday night, 
hows that the November term grand 


jury returned true bills in 224 cases, 


and that a. total of 210 cases was 
tried in that court during the same 
period. 

Of this number, 165 convictions were 
obtained, 40° defendants were found 


hot guilty, and five mistrials resulted. 


Twenty-six cases were transferred to 
the city court of Atlanta, and 166 in- 
dictments nol-prossed, some of ich, 
according to the record, had been hang- 
ing fire since 1919. 

Solicitor Boykin stated that the ree- 
ords would show that none of the 
fndictments nol-prossed had ‘any rela- 
tion to the investigation by the grand 
jury of the bunco operations here. 

The record for the office for the year 
192iashows that -1,609 indictments 
were returned, 1,374 cases disposed of 
‘and * sg, wang 730 are open on the 
books. yme of the cases disposed of 
came over from 1920, it was shown. 

Of the cases tried during the past 
term of court, 15 guilty verdicts in 
homicide cases were returned: 19 as- 
suults to murder; 34 burglaries; 16 
lurceny of automobiles; six robberies 
and rine lareenies from the house.

440, according to the apnual report of 
Dr. J. P. Kennedy, city-bealth officer, 
filed with eity council Monday after- 
noon. This is a. death rate of 14.76 
per 1,000. for 1921; against 17.49 in 
| 1920, ‘and a°birth rate of 21.74 against 
20.285 for 1920, showing a gratifying 
gain which corresponds to the increase 
in state figures published exclusively 
iu The Constitution Sunday. 

Total deaths numbered 3,062 in 
1921 and 3,509 the year before. Total 
births were 4,510 last year, compared 
with 4,070 in 1920. There were 1,655 
girls and 1,651 boys born of white 
parentage, and 603 female and 601 
male children born of negro parents. 

Accidental Deaths. 

The number of deaths by accident 
and violence were 266, T2 less- than 
reported in 1920, when there were 288. 
Deaths from pneumonia -decreased 
from 623 to 347, but deaths from tu- 
berculosis gained 23, going to 242. 

Three hundred and _ ninety-five 
deaths of children under one year of 
age were reported. A list of deaths 
f. m other causes is‘as follows: Ac- 
cident and violence, 266; diphtheria, 
21; erysipelas, 1; enchephalitis lethar- 
gica, 1; influenza, 19; meningitis, 15; 
mnalaria, 8; measles, 8; pneumonia, 
$47: pellagra, 22; smallpox, 3; scar- 
let. fever, 8; syphilis, 31; tuberculosis, 
242; typhoid, 24; whooping cough, 5. 

Decrease in Pneumonia. 

It. was stated by Dr. Kennedy that 
the fall shown in the death rate from 
| pneumonia was due to Atlanta’s com- 
parative freedom from influenza last 
year. Many influenza cases in the 
epidemic of 1921 developed into pneu- 
—— and numbers died from the dis- 


as 

The birth report showed 36 sets of 
white twins born in 1921, while among 
the negro population 15 sets of.twins 


and one set of triplets were reported. 


I.. Thornton, clerk of vital statistics 
of the board, asserted that the birth 
report would have been probably 1.000 
greater had no physicians been derelict 
in their duty of reporting births.

a three-fold obligation: 


First—to the Public, it owes good service at a saissiiaaliile 
charge. The efficient operation of a railroad requires long 

_ experience and technical training. Dictation as to operation 
sometimes practiced by public Commissions often imposes 
‘burdens on the railroad with no corresponding benefit to the 


- public. 


Second—To the owners, it owes the duty of fully main- 


taining the ‘property and earning a 


investment.

rules, considerate treatment and a just wage, recognizing thie 


mature of the service performed,

in other industries and the ability of the railroad to pay such 


wages. 


3. To meet these obligations satisfactorily, the manage-

The attraction 1s a melange of clever 
vaudeville’ numbers that’ change as 
swiftly and as smoothly as the most 
fastidiotis critic could desire. ‘The 
Settings are. unusually effective, the 
costumes are stunning and the situa- 
tions hold many hearty laughs. 

As for the principals, they are all 
that could be desired in a show of the 
type. Blanche King is too well-known 
to require notice, Charles’ Winninger 
is one Of the most accomplished come- 
dians ever seen on a local stage: Win- 
ona Winter displays a dash and verve 
that is refreshing, and Jay Gould ap- 
pears to advantage in the midst of 
a bevy of fresh, attractive chorus girls, 

The music covers a wide range and 
consists of numbers original to the 
production as ‘well as favorites of oth- 
er plays that have gone over big. 

Altogether “The Broadway Whirl’ 
is a sbow that provides its full quota 
of entertainment for any one evening

‘Keith Vaudeville. 
(At the Lyric.) 


Clever acting placed McCool and 
Rarick in their skit, “Atta Boy, Mc- 
Cormack,” far above the other acts 
at Keith's Lyric last night in® the 
opening bill for the first three da'ys 
ot the week. Their wit and comedy 
added much to a set of clever lines. 

Miller and Bradford, in “Typical, 
Topical Tales,” had a good closing 
act. They had some good songs and 
sang them well. | 

A sather one-sided ‘dialogue fea- 
‘tured the act presented by May Me- 
ville’and George Rule, entitled “The 
League of Servants,” While they did 
little dancing, what they did was ex- 
ceptionally good. ; 

IIart and Francis presented an ex- 
cellent hoop act and were recipients 
of hearty applause. Polly and Oz, in 
“Syncopated Comedy,” had few 
clever songs. Screen news ad Top- 
ics of the Day opened the bill. 


Loew Vaudeville. 


(At the Grand.) 

“Cutting “a Woman in Two,” 
Startling in its performance ° but 
painless as done by the Great Ker-’ 
miss, is the featured attraction at 
Loew’s Grand theater for the first 
half of the week. This widely her- 
alded illusion is one of the most 
puzzling tricks that has ever been 
presented. on the vaudeville stage. 
Before the unobstructed view of 
the audience, on ai fully Hehted 
nen without the aid of curtains 
0 rapery, a young lady is placed 
inside ‘an ordinary pine box and 
then apparently sawed completely 
in two. How it is Gone makes it of 
rreat interest and is a subject. for 
thought. ‘3 : : 

The Riyerside, Three fs. one of 
the’ bést’6f the other acts on the 
kale “Dill.” In’ the characters of 
Chinaman; blackface and straight, 
these three singers entertain with 
several excellent song numbers and 
introduce a jot of good. comedy. 

Other acts that please are Rilla 
Willard and company in a clever 
one-act comedy, “The Deciston:” 
LaRose and Adams in a comedy 
skit, and Alvin and -Kenny, with 
b*lancing, tumbling and daring 
stunts on the flying rings. 

The screen program is headed by 
Pearl White in “Any Wife,” an in- 
teresting story of mother love. 


“The C onquering Power.” 


(At the Howard.) 

Rex Ingram, through jis mas- 
terful production for Me “The 
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,” 
established himself s4upreme among 
directors. A tremendous spectacle. 
envisaging the war as _ reflected 
through two continents, it over- 
whelmed with a superb sense of 
power. 

In “The Conquering Hero,” his 
mewest production, seen last night 
at the Howard theater, he works in 
an: entirely different genre. Here 
we have an intensely intimate study 
of family life, a universal story of 
love and greed against the back- 
ground of a French provincial town. 
The story has been adapted by 
June Mathis from Balzac’s novel, 
“KBugenie Grandet,’ with swift- 
moving, masterful continuity. Mr. 
Ingram ha® illustrated it with pic- 
tures that have the tonal) quality 
of great works of art: the_ soft 
lighting of thea photoplay and the 
perfectly composed groupings give 
an exquisite sense of reality. 


“The Affairs of Anatol.” 


(At the Strand.) ~ 

Cecil B. De Mille, perhaps the 
fotemost motio picture producer 
in the country, not the world, 
displayed his genius at its best in 
his latest Paramount picture, “The 
Affairs of Anatol,’ which was pre- 
sented with splendid effect at the 
Strand theater Monday. From 
every . Standpoint—investiture, 
all-star cast, sumptuousness of set- 
tings, brilliance of directorial exe- 
cution, richness of costumes, qual- 
ity of story and general artistry, 
this picture marks a distinct epoch 
in screen production of the decade. 


“Cappy Ricks.” 


(At the Vaudette.)  _ 
Thomas Meighan, athletic Para- 
mount star, seldom, if ever, disap- 
oints his audiences. Hence it fol- 
ows that when his picture, “Cappy 
icks.” based on Peter B, Kyne's 


\ famous’ Saturday Evening Post: sto- 


was shown at the Vaudette 
theater Monday, Mr. Meighan add- 
ed another delightful morsel to his 
‘Jong list’ of picture euccesses. 

Mr. Meighan is excellent as

“Son of Wallingfor Bg 


(At the Tudor.) , 
“The Son of Wallingford,” which 
was shown at the Tudor theater 
Monday. is an excellent picture.. Tt 
has many big spectacular scenes, 
but, 2bove all, it-is logical and hu- 
‘man and does not , depend on 
grandeur of production for fits en- 
tertainment. There is as much real 
human interest th'a.simvle love 
scene between, Jimmy Wallingford 
and Mary Curtis as in.the mam- 
moth staging for which the pro- 
duction has become known. It has 
its moments of intense @ramatie

He is brought up by tutors aboard

Approximately 1,000 cases were 
made in 1921 in excess of the num- 
ber for the preceding year, according 
to a preliminary police report issued 
Monday. During 1921 the Atlanta pvo- | 
lice made 1,548 state cases and 26.- 
179 city cases. A new record for ar- 
rests also was shown by the annua! 
report by Chief George Mathieson, of 
the county police force, which was 
filed Monday with the county com- 
missioners, a total of 1,177 cases be- 
ing made during the year 1921. 

Complete reports of operations for 
the closing year, of both city and 
county police departments, were not 
uvailabl Monday, as the tedious com- 
vilations have not. becn completed. 

or the city police, the total for 
1920 was given as 26,269, incinding 
both city and state cases, making al- | 
most a thoysand under the number | 
for 1921, 

The number of automobile accidents | 
for 1921 reached the total of 567. The | 
number in 1920 was 541.. This in- | 
crease came despite city-wide agita- | 
ae for the enforcement of traffic 
avs. 


Thirteen People Killed. 
Lhe number of persons’ injured in 
nutomebile accidents reached the to- 
tal of 356, of which 13 resulted 
fataily. ’ 

‘Railroad fatalities wifhin the cor- 
porate city limits for 1921 were 10 
persons killed, this number being in- 
cluded in a total of 28 persons who 
were victims of railroad accidents. 
Some of the remaining 18 were maim- 
ed for life. 

Qne person was killed by motor- 
evycle in 1921, a total of 3S accidents 
having been reported and recorded. 

Against 15 murders in 1920, 25 
were recorded in 1921. 

Fifty-three persons were injured in 
sireet car accidents in 1921 and two 
killed. 

Fourteen Suicides Reported. 

Jpuring the year 14 suicides were 
recorded, 5 persons accidentally sent 
to death, 2 drowned, 1\ burned to 
death, 1 killed by bicycle, 1 electro- 
cuted and 1 dead from asphyxiation. 

Amounts collected from recorder’s 
court during 1921 totaled $162,567.20. | 


This shows a large decrease. This 
falling off in receipts came as a sir- | 
prise because of recent city-wide cru- | 
sades launched by p@lice and citizen | 
bodies, among them being the traffic 
drive and narcotic crusade, all of 
which netted the city treasury neat 
sims. From time to time round-ups 
of criminals have made _recorder’s 
court heavily congested, all of which, | 
it was thought, would considerably 
ewell the receipts of recorder’s court. 
Fines collected\in 1920 aggregated 
£220,069. 

The amount of fines imposed in 
cases brought by county officers was 
#20,042. A total of 3.692 months on 
the chaingang and 172 years in the 
penitentiary resulted from arrests by 
county policemen. 

The amount of stolen property re- 
eovered by eounty officers was $10.- 


} wards and return on sates 


'state fines reached a total of $19,- 


409.43 and the amounts of fees, re- 


A778. Pian ee 

During 1921, county policemen an- 

swered 976 calls, placed 22 persons 

on prrobation and had nine o*hers 
sent to reformatory schools, + 
Work of Detecives. 

Stolen property valued at $218,602 
was recovered }y the Atlanta de-, 
tective department during the fear 
1921, the annual report of A. Lamar 
Poole, chief of the’ department, show- 
ed Monday. 

Of this amount, recovered automo- 
biles returned to owners ard valued 
at $149.178 were included. 

The mark of 1921 fell below that 
of 1920, which was_a record year in 
stolen property recovered and which 
aggregated $261.S58. 

City fines levied in cases made by 
detectives totaled $28,552 in 1921, and 


cars was 


512. 
Bonds forfeited in both city and 
state cases amounted to $39,650. 


MUNICIPAL FARM 
URGED FOR DRUNKS 
AND DRUG ADDICTS 


\ 

In his annual report issued Monday, 
Judge George A. Jolinson, of city re- 
corder’s court, recommended the estab- 
lishment of a municipal farm in At- 
lanta for habitual drunkards, drug; 
addiets and other incorrigibies. 

Judge Johnson deplored the condi- 
tions of drug addicts and other classes 


of citizens and said that the establish- 
ment of such a farm would give them 
a chance of reform. 

Judge Johnson also recommended 
that an increase of salary be given 
to officer W. A. Dodd and Bond Clerk 
Fuldleman, hecause these two men are 
forced to Work several hours addi- 
tional a day at the city stockade. 

The report showed an inerease in 
number of cases handled by recorder’s 
eourt for 1921 over 1920, the total 
for the year just ended reaching

26,179, whereas in 1920 there were 
handled 24.342. 

The judge called attention to the, 
fact that comparatively few cases: 
were certioraried Fagan. 1921, and in| 
the few cases whére such an atfemnt | 
vas made, the recorder’s decision was ' 
generally sustained. Judge Johnson 
extended his thanks to City Attorney 
James L. Mayson and Assistant City 
Attorney Jesse M. Wood for their’ 
services. 


MILTON AVE. CLUB 
TO PLAN TONIGHT 
BIG IMPROVEMENT 


A called meeting of the Milton Ave- 
nue Community club will be held at 
the Milton avenue’ school ‘Tuesday 
evening, January 4, for the purpose of 
discussing the cost of installing plumb 
ing in homes in the Federal prison 
district of the city. The report of the 
committees on street lighting, the pav- 
ing of Hill street, repairing of Milton 
avenue and widening McVonough road 
will be heard. 

The matter of street lighting for the

all, who has promised to present this 
matter at the next meeting of council. 


Of Establishing 
Case in Mystery 


. Macon, Ga., January 2.—(Special.) 
Solicitor-General Charles M. Garrett, 
after a conference with F. P. Arm- 
strong, Jr., son of F. P. Armstrong, 
Sr., of Atlanta, the man who died at 
the Macon hospital on 
night as a result of a fall from the 


third story window of the Saratoga 
hotel, said\that while the theory of 
mutder has not been abandoned en- 
tirely. there is little chance of estab- 
lishing a case around anyone who di- 
rectly or indirectly d been connect- 
ed with the case. 

According to the solicitor, it prac- 
tically- has been proven-that Arm- 
strong was robbed before he fell or 
was tLrown from the hotel window 
and the city and county autbLorities 
are still working on the case in the 
hope of finding a clue to who took 
the money. 

F: P. Armstrong, Jr., of Valdosta, 
came to Macon Saturday night. To- 
day he told of a mysterious telephone 
message he received at ee Sat- 
urday afternoon from some tdentified 
persoh. who stated that | “the. man 
who threw your father out of the 
window had a speckled gray suit and 
was in the coal box.” The party do- 
ing the telephoning t!.en hung up the 
receiver and efforts to locate where 
the nhone call came from were futile. 
Armstrong then came immediately to 
Macon and communicated with city 
detectives as he was leaving. 

A conference was arranged with 
the solicitor-general f6r today. So- 
licitor, Garrett stated today that in 
his opinion the telephone call was 
possibly someone playing a joke on 
Armstrong, but he was unable to ac- 
coant for how the unidentified per- 
son knew there was a coal box in the 
room large enough for a man to hide.

FAVORED BY GE 


Urging amore rigid enforcement of 
the criminal lavs.in 1922, Judge John 
B. Humphries, Monday, in charging 
the January term grand jury, deplored 
the increase of crime in Atlanta and 


Fulton county. 

Judge Humphries declared that law | 
enforcement is greatly handicapped by 
the activit‘es of many prominent citi 
zens, who cal) loudly in public for) 
strict punishment of criminals and for 
chaingang sentences, then use their ef- 
forts privately to obtain leniency for 
bootleggers, automobile thieevs and 
other lawbreakers. 

“And wheb 1 refuse to interfere ip) 
these cases, the same prominent citi 
zens take the matter up with the state 
prison commission and seek to undo all 
the courts have done at great expense, 
stated Judge Humphries. He further 
declared that he was in favor of gang 
sentences, and not mere fines for crim: 
inals, 

W. J. Blalock, president of the: 
Fulton National bank, was elected; 
foreman of the new grand jury, :md W. 
Ff, Crusselle was named secretary. 


MORE MEN SOUGHT 
FOR FIRE FIGHTERS: 


Extension of the firé alarm system | 
in the city, and additional. men and 
equipment for the fire department, 
were recommended in the annual re- 
port of Fire Chief Cody and the 
board of fire masters, to city council 
Monday. ‘Twenty-five additional fire 
alarm boxes were recommended. 


It was pointed out that a district 
north of Ponce de Leon avenue, on 
the belt line railroad, was rapidly 
growing into a residential center, 
and was without. fire boxes. The 
residents were compelled to rely upon 
telephones to communicate with the 
fire department, it was set forth. 
Chief Cody urged that fire boxes be 
installed in this district. 

Chief Cody said that from past ex- 
perience, he finds that “the depart- 
ment is seriously handicapped by not 
being manned with the proper number 
of men. We have not a sufficient 
number off working force in some of 
the companies. There should be an 
addition of two men to these com- 
panies.” 

Included in the new equipment re- 
quested was a hook and ladder wagon 
for No. 10 engine house in the Grant 
Park section, and a new pumper for 
the force. “The pumper is doubly 
necessary,” it was declared, “in case 
of a breakdown of some of the equip- 
ment.” 

Fire Inspector Needed. 


Chief Cody asked that an additional 
fire inspector be appointed. It was! 
set forth that W. D. Benson, fire! 
inspector, had inspected 6,932 build- 
ings, and that additions to the build- 
ing center of the city made it im- 
possible that the necessary inspections 
be. made by one man. 

Although a total of more than $12.- 
000,000 worth of property here was 
exposed to risk of fire in 1921, the 
damage aggregated only $1,000,289, it 
was indicated. It was stated that the 
number of fire, 2.049, was the largest 
in the history Of the city, and that 
the loss ratio to the number ns 


| 


| comparatively small. 

Sparks. falling upon_.shingle.. roo 
from a chimney caused the greates 
‘number of fires, it was stated. The 
, numbers attributed to this cause was 
| 540. Careless, with 249, came second 
.and fires of undetermined cause num- 
, bered 209. Other causes were de- 
' fective flues, 136; trash fires, 191, 
‘ond lightning, 10. Sixteen incendiary 
| fires were indicated on_ the, report. 
| One fire Was caused by children play- 
| ing with fire. It was shown that five 
ealls were occasioned by food burning 
in an oven, and one by-.an over- 
heated smoke-house. 


$1,009,289 Property Loss. 
Insurance on the total. amount of 
| property engangered valued at $12.- 
| 722.500, it was indicated, aggregated 
| $8,803,482, The actual loss of prop- 
'erty was $1,009.289, and the total | 
| insirance paid on the loss was 
| $979,544. ° | 

December, the month in. which the 
| greatest number of fires occurred 
| witnessed the loss of property valued 
, at $205,322. The month until a few 
days ago was below the average in 
| fire loss, when a fire at the Atlanta 
Rarber Supply company, in South 
| Pryor street added $120,000 to the 


| amount. 
Other months in which 


unusual 


$117,007; March, $133,991, and May, 
$166.518. The smaller losses of any 
_month, 821.690, were reported for 
November. 

The board of fire masters embodied 
in the report an order that the 
hiography of Assistant Chief Samuel 
-R. Chapman, killed September 28 
fighting a fire at Powell street dnd 
the Georgia railroad, be written into 
the minutes of the board as a “slight 
| testimonial of our admiration of duty 
well performed.” 


WINTER’S RECORD 
FOR FIRES BROKEN 
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY 


Announcement by Chief Cody, of the 
fire department, Monday that there 
were thirty-two fires in Atlanta New 
Year’s Day disclosed the fact. that 
all flame records for the winter were 
broken. The large number is attribu- 
table to high winds and cold weatier, 
| Aecording to Chief Cody. The dam- 
| age in each case was small.

Fiorence, Ala., January 2.—The 
Constructon Company of North 
America is a competitive bidder for 
the government’s aitrate plants and 
power sites at Muscle Shoals, C. C. 
‘Tinkler, president vf the corporation, 
announced here today. 

Mr. Tinkler in a gormal statement 
suid that his company had submit- 
ied to Netretary Weeks “a concrete 
and businesslike preposition.” 

The cOmpany, proposes, he said, to 
complete Wilson dum and power

the ‘Linkter pian, wouid rest tinal 
decision as to the feasibility of com- 
pieting dam No. 3, and of operating

Continuing, Mr. ‘inkier - outiuned 
his pian further: 

As the government would have been 
repaid its full investment it would be 
in a position to seil to the farmer fer- 
tilizer at cost; it would not require

and might be wiiiihg to accept + or

makes it possible for the government 
to help the farmer. This plan piaces 
in the absolute and undisputed con- 
trol of the government the operation 
of the power plant and of the nitrate 
plants, and returns to the government

sentatives of C. C.-Tinkler, of San 
Francisco, are schesuled to lay be- 
fore Secretary Weeks in detail this

cle Shoals power project. Neither 
the secretary nor the war department 
experts who are devoting almost their 
entire attention. to the numerous 
projects relating to ene great Alabama 
plant have been advised officially of

ne forecast could be obtained today 
of the attitude whien would be taken 
toward it. 

Secretary Weeks has repeatedly de- 
clared. himself in »tver of disposing 
of the properties in such a way as 
will relieve the government of respon-. 
sibility for completing them, but at 
th: same time will insure continued 


operation to the inaustrial advantage | i 


of the country. He also has express- 


ed opposition to any suggestion which | 


involved the government retaining any ! 


ownership interest.

WAY ASK LAY OF 


Macon, Ga., January 2,—(Special.) 
Employees of the Central of Geor- 
gia railway shops will meet tomortow 
oer next day to de “de whether or not 


they will ask the company officials 
for a Saturday lay-off, instead of hav- 
ing S82 men dropped fyom the pay- 
rolls of the company, 

The Central of Georgia is reducing 
operating expenses and has decided to 
eut the force at the shops. The em- 
ployees say that a Saturday Aiy~wff 
would be tantamount te a reditiction in 
pay distributed among 500 men. The 
cut would eb light,*they say, where 
laying off 82 men would be a hard- 
ship on them and their families. 

The decision of the meeting will be 
communicated to the master mechanic, 
who will report to the operating of. 
fices at Savannah. 

Action of 78 men employed in the 
Macon fire department today saved 
seven of their number from being 
thrown out of employment. The fire- 
men presented a pettion signed. by 
every man in the department, urging 
that their wat¢es be eut $10 4 man as 
a sobhution to the rroblem raised under 
the 1922 budget. which calls for a re- 
duction of expenses in the fire depart- 
ment.* The fire committee of city 
council indi@ated that the action of 
the firemen will solve the problem. 


Paris is losing its fiacres. and this | when

niaced in the taxi. A few years Ago 
it was computed that there were & 000

there were only a few more than 2.

| of the liberal forces of mankind.” 
A fund of at least a million dol- 
lars will be raised by poptlar sub- 
scription and the income from this 
fund is to be used to grant awards 
“to the individual or group that 
has rendered within a specific pe- 
riod meritorious service to democ- 
racy, public welfare, liberal 
thought, or peace through justice.” 
“A rose to the living is worth ten 
thousand to the dead,” and no 
more appropriate tribute could be 
paid to this great man than this 
movement to forever keep alive the 
ideals of the former president. 
Early in his term as president, 
Mr. Wilson said in an address to 
students at Swarthmore college: 
“We die but once and we die 
without distinction if we are not 
willing to die the death of sacrifice. 
Do you covet honor? You will 
never get it by serving yourself. 


Do you covet distinction? You will 
get it only as @ servant of man- 


kind.” 

What better words than these 
to which the, ex-president was al- 
ways faithful can be found to serve 
as a watchword for the Founda- 


tion? 


THINGS TO WIN BY. 
The bright smile, the cheery 


word and the hearty handshake as 
friendship-makers and business- 
winners in the new year! 

They helped business and bright- 
ened things generally in the cld 


year, with. all its trials and 
troubles; they weré winners then, 
as they have ever been, in putting 
more heart and hope in the world’s 
work; they succeeded in winning 
over many of the gloom-gatherers 
to the brighter side. 

Of the various styles of hand- 
shake that repel or attract, The 
Baltimore American says— 

“There is the cold-frog type of 
handshake, one sample of which is 
enough for most people. There is 
the finger-tip style, which séems to 
indicate that the givers either think 
themselves superior or, worse still, 
have something to conceal. There 
is the clasp. which precedes ‘one 
longing, lingering look’ cast behind 
(when one is in love), and there ‘is 
the hearty, thrilling clasp of the 
friend, the person whd6, as the small. 
boy said ‘knows all about yer and 
likes yer just the same.’”’ 

That last specimen—or as much 
of it as possible—is the one to put 
in operation in this year of grace 
and opportunity; and when ac- 
companied by the cheerful smile 
and the optimistic word, it will 
work wonders! 

It is Hke meeting a citizen of 
Grouchtown who faced the bright 
morning with a frown, and a no- 
hope-in-the-world sort of feeling, 
and putting new*life and spirit in 


point altogether. a8 
The spirit of optimism is * catch- 


ing.” 


NEEDLESS WORRY. 

Reviewing the work of the past 
year, in the light of krightening 
business prospects, Editor Herring, 
of The Tifton (Ga.) Gazette, has 
a wholesome new year “sermon” on 
the needless worry that is a stum- 
bling block to business. 

“Cut out the worry for once,” is 
the timely advice: “Get too busy 
|.to entertain it!”

| Georgia Rates 


dT character and kihfd. 


| In Light of Western Competition 


E. T. Comer, head of the 3B. T. 
Comer company, conducting perhaps 
the largest plantation in Georgia 
and operating on 16,000 acres in 
i Screven:and Burke counties, wrote 
on November 23, 1921, the following 
letter to Chair Cc. M. Candler, 
of the Georgia road commission 
—the correspondence having just 
been. made public: : 

“E. T. Comer Company, Millhaven, 
Ga., November 23, 1921.—Hon. C. M. 


Candler of Georgia, Atlanta, 
Ga.—Dear Mr. Candler: About 
the best. speech Mr. £Wilson 
made during his first cam- 
paign, at least, I thought so,-was 
his address to thé farmers, in Which 
the fact was stressed that their in- 
terests were not properly looked 
after in Washington. 

“T feel that we have to come to 
our commission; hence, this letter, 
to bring to your attention matters 
directly affecting the farmers of 
the state. While I know that you 
are familiar with the general freight 
rates in the state, I am impelled to 
write you and bring to your atten- 
tion how serious the situation is 
to the farmer. I do not know that 
I can do this in any more lucid way 
than to give you just the conditions 
that face us here at Millhaven. 

“We began several years ago, di- 
versified farming systematically or- 
ganized, having something over 16,- 
000 acres under fence. fe do not 
go in for anything fancy in any line 
of work, but do plain farming on 
what might be considered an in- 
tensive plans We rrow cotton, corn, 
oats, rye, peas and velvet beans, 
and have a - herd of 12,000 
or 1,500 heag of beef  cattie 
and about the same number of hogs, 
I mention these facts as an indica- 
tion that any situation that would 
press hard on an Organization like 
ours, where overhead is distributed 
over the farm of sufficient amount 
not to make it oppressive, wouid 
make ita still greater burden to the 
smaller operator, and would, there- 
fore, call for relief of the agricul- 
tural population, whom I conceive 
to be the literal backbone of any 
country. : 

Freight Rates Oppregsive. 

“The present situation in regard 
to freight rates we find to be -very 
oppressive. Millhaven must ship 
its cotton to Savannah or Augusta, 


these being the nearest markets, 
and concentration point. In 1916 
our rate on cotton Millhaven to 
Augusta, was 21.cents per hundred 
pounds. In 1927 our rate to Au- 
ta was raised to 26 cents, while the 
rate to Savannah was left at 21 
cents. During 1918, 1919 and 1920 
we had to pay 41 cents per 100 
pounds to Augusta and 37 cents per 
hundred pounds to Savannah. Final- 
ly, this year, 1921, our rate to both 
Augusta and Savannah was raised 
to 46 cents per hundred pounds, 
more than 100 per cent increase 
over the 1916 rate. 


“Argument of high cost of liv- 
ing to justify these conditions fall 
on rather contracted stomachs. So 
far as the farmer is concerned, 


everything we produce, except cot- 
ton, is below prewar prices, the 
price of cotton being, of course, 
affected by short crop and boll wee- 
vil conditions. The increased freight 
rate reférred to on cotton goes all 
down the line. We have at Mill- 
haven a large surplus of corn for 
sale, and on account of the freights 
it would be hard to sell this surplus 
for 40 cents per bushel. For_in- 
stance, our-rate on grain to Ma- 
con is 24 cents and to Augusta 131-2 
cents. We sold some oats to Co- 
lumbus“Ga.. and had to pay 331-2 
cents per hundred pounds, all In 
carload lots. Of course, the farm- 
pavs these advanced rates on 
everything that he buys of every 


” 


“In 1916 here at Millhaven we 
were not content with a yield of 
cotton of less than'an average of a 
bale per acre, and our tenants pro- 
duced from twelve to fifteen bales. 
per plow, and in some cases, more, 
without difficulty. Today, by rea- 
son of boll weevil conditions, a 
vield of about three bales per p.ow 
is the best we can expect, even 
where we use tl most improved 
methods of cultivd@ion and fight the 
boll weevil with all our might and. 


“We seé¢,” says ‘Uncle’ Jim Wil-| 
liams, “where a ‘Gentleman Bandit’) 
robbed a train. In our opinion. there| 
ain’t no such ‘animile.’ All bandits 
and thieves are damned rascals !”

record is made up, Editor Herring 


says-— 

“As we recall the dark hours, and 
the times when the sun broke 
through the clouds, we are impress- 
ed with how futile was all the wor- 
ry; of how little difference any of 
it will make ten years from now—

HONORING WILSON. 


‘Little more than a year ago on 
Christmas eve, the Woodrow W'!!- 
son foundation was organized. Al- 
though much publicity has been 
given the movement there is still 
much misunderstanding and ig- 
norance about the plan. 

The Woodrow Wilson foundation

The folly of worrying, and even 
worry 
about, are well illustrated in the 
case of the old “calamity prophet” 
who exclaimed, when informed 
that he had inherited a fortune, 
“Lord, help! That'll be another 
worry to me!” ’ 

Work is the foe of worry, and if 
forecasts hold good, there 
should be enough of it throughout 
this year to keep the willing ones 
too busy to waste time counting 
the little troubles that are not 
worth worrying over. 


The Indianapolis News speaks 
of it as “a trip ’twixt the hip and 


the lip.” 


Since congress proposes to “get 

down to business” in this new 

year, the hope js that it will even- 
tually catch up with it. 


Also, there was New ¥ear egs- 


ja both an inspiration and a re- 
*ward—with something very con- 


crete about the reward. 

According to the statement of 
the thinking men and women who 
have become interested in the

foundation has been created “in

(Copyright, 1921, for The Constitution) 


STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN. 

Much of life is a serios of set-backs. 

The boy works. The young man 
works. The grown man works. Then 


there comes a day when his harvest 
fields bear in abundance. He builds 
a fine home, 


Hardly does he open its halls before 
fire destroys it to the ground! 


What does he do? Give up? Oh, 
No! His is not that kind of a make- 
up. The very next morning he RE- 
builds—as Edison‘did a few years ago, 
before the shaes were yet cold. 

History is full of instanaes where 


Fame didn’t even smile until the white 
sheet of winter had well arrived. 


Starting all over again is no dis- 
grace, no matter how old you are or 


how miserable your failure may Jook 
to you. 


The only disgrace is—not to start 
all over! 

When it comes right down to facts, 
we are all perpetual “start-overs.” 
Each day finds us with the memory of 


lost hopes and unachieved aims like 
broken vases scattered at our feet: 
But we must walk beyond them. 


Try to feed upon fresh resolves—un- 


til they nourish your soul into a being 
that is not afraid. 


Yes, start all over again—today! 


Map out new plans. You will find a 
thrill in that process alone. 


It is much better to have lost 


won yesterday—and lost today.

“November 25, 1921. 
“Mr. EB. T. Comer, Millhaven, Ga. 
—Dear Sir: YF have your favor of

cussion of the situation, particular- 
ly with reference to rates on agri-

“The problem before the commis- 
sion when considered in connection 


of 1920, as interpreted by the in- 
terstate commerce commission, is a 
complicated one. Should congress 
amend the transportation act of 1920 
so aS to restore to the states unre- 
stricted jurisdiction over intrastate 
commerce, or should the supreme 
COUrs Of the United States decide in 
the isconsjn case that she inter- 
state commerce commission has mis- 
construed the transportation act in 
this respect, our task would be 
easier. 

“In the meantimé, however, we 
are hoping to accomplish something 


of constructive benefit.

EALTH TALKS|

|HE WILLYAM BRADY, M. D. 


ARTHRITIS. 

Arthritis was the title I intended 
to use for this talk. Then I changed 
my mind because that seemed a little 
too showy, and decided to call it joint 


inflammation. Then I changed .my 
mind because that didn’t seem quite 
accurate, since I meant to discuss 
chronic rheumatism, which often has 
little about it that is inflammatory in 
the popular sense of the world, and 
then I happened to recall that there 
is no such condition as rheumatism, so 
I compromised on the title arthritis, 
which is medical for joint inflamma- 
tion or rheumatiz. Sometimes I re- 
gret have abolished rheumatism colds, 
catarrh, nervous breakdown and indi- 
gestion, for often these misleading 
names help a doctor out of an embar- 
rassing situation and soothe his pa- 
tients or readers too. 

Dr. Ralph Pemberton, Philadelphia. 
having carefully studied some 400 
cases of chronic or long enduring joint 
trouble in an army hospital, draws 
some striking .conclusions. I am re- 
luctant to note that he attributes to 
exposure the “precipitating factor” in 
rather more than half of ethe cases, 
though he acrefully points out the 
chief or primary cause, bacterial in- 
fection, generally from some septic 
focus elsewhere in the body. Other 
“precipitating factors” were such tan- 
gible conditions as influenza, trphoid 
fever, pneumonia, injury. 

As for exposure, it seemed that this 
hypothetical factor was seized on by 
Dr. Pemberton and his associates in 
lien of tangible factors in those cases 
in which no other apparent precipi- 
tating factor was recognized. True, the 
soldiers had been subjected to cruel ex- 
posure to cold, mud and wet, in 
France. But, after all; how very few 
of the men so exposed suffered arth- 
ritis or any other illness therefron, 

* Dr: ‘Pemberton assumes—withént 
scientific reason, however—that ex- 
posure to cold and yet impairs :the cir- 
culation, particularly diminishes the 


blood supply to joints, and as a result 
of the diminished supply of blood the 
disease takes on renewed activity. This 
IS a very old theory which is plausible 
enough but has no scientifig' support. 
Furthermore, the opposite conception, 
namely that chilling of the body brings 
about a congestion, say of the lungs, 
that is an excess of blood or an in- 
creased blood supply to the Jungs and 
is therefore precipitating factor or 
pneumonia or some such infectious 
condition; in fact the old.time doctors 


farmer the cost of producing, enti- 
tle the farmer to a full measure 
of consideration when it comes to 
setting the rates his products pay | 
for transportation. : 


“The plain fact is that, although 
we have a large amount of corn 
and oats for sale, the freight rates 
practically prohibit us from being 


able to sell these commodities in 
the larger markets in Georgia in 
competition with western grain. I 
hear a great deal about “milling in 
transit” rates. We have one of 
the largest meal mills in the United 
States at Juliette, Ga., but we have 
heen unable to sell them any corn. 
There is a very large feed mill in 
Macon using oats and corn, buf we 
are unable to sell them. 

“Our foremost thinkers and leaders 
constantly urge upon the farmers 
of Georgia that we must diversify 
our products; that we must quit de- 
pending entirely on cotton. Yet, 
for some reason, which I do not 
fully understand, there are no_ade- 
quate market facilities that a Geor- 
gia farmer may use in selling corn, 
hay. beef cattle or hogs, and the 
west continues to ship these arti- 
cles very largely into our state, 
and very largely supply our market 
with them. 

“I think there is something about 
the freight rates that has a good 
deal to do with this condition, and 
I hope you will look into the mat- 
ter to see if something cannot be 
done to remedy such a situation. 


“If Georgia farmers are to be en- 
couraged to raise corn, oats and 


feedstuffs, the freight rates cer- 
that tRe millers. feed-mixers and 


believed that the chilling was the one 
and sufficient cause of pneumonia. 


The conception of diminished blood 


supply and consequently diminished 
metabolism, diminished oxidation of 
the tissues in general and of the joint 
structures in particular, has taken a 
firm hold of Dr. Pemberton’s mind. 
He weighs all the methods of treat- 
ment which have given apparent bene- 
fit in chronic arthritis, and determines 
their value by measuring their effect 
upon. the local blood supply of the 
joint and upon the general and local 
metabolism. On this score—and here 
I step gracefully over to Dr. Pember- 
ton’s support—he extols one remedy 
which many victims of chronic arthri- 
tis sadly neglect, namely, exercise, be- 
cause it increases oxidation and every- 
thing. 


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. 
Bright's Disease. 
Please tell me whether one with 


chronic Bright’s disease should abstain 
from tomatoes, also whether he may 
eat red meats.—(L. M. H.)- 


Answer—Tomatoes are rather bene- 
ficial for a nephritic, and red meats 
are in every way as wholesome as any 
other color bt meat. There is in fact 
little «sound reason why one with 
Bright’s disease (nephritis) should 
not eat whatever kind of meat he pre- 
fers, in reasonable quantities. 

Lemonade and Milk. 


Is it injurious to drink lemonade 


tainly ought to be geared up so 
dealers in these commodities could 
afford to buy them from the Geor- 
gia farmers and not in the west. 


Rates on Cattle. 
“IT wish also that you would look 
into the matter of rates on beef 
cattle and hogs from, not only Mill- 


haven, but other shipping points in 
Georgia, to the packing houses and 


slaughter houses in the state. 
“I cannot quite appreciate the 
attitude of the railroads, if they 


are actually opposed to some ad- 
justment downward in our rates. I 
am advised that they are very short 


of tonnage, and I have also learned 
that along the lines of the railroads 


of our state a great deal of cotton 
and other commodities are moving 
by truck, as being less expensive 
in transportation than to ship by 
freight as formerly. It seems to 
me that the railroads will, if they 
Reontinue to hold up the freight 
rates, finally destroy a large per- 
centage of their local business, as 
this movement oy truck when once 
well established will likely con- 
tinue, even though it be a little 
more expensive than transportation 
by railroad, on account of its great- 
er convenience. to the Shippers and 
receivers of freight. 


“Of course, the grgin exchanges, 
elevators, elevator associations, and

west-can, and probably do employ 
a trained force of rate experts who

"Twas Fifty Years Ago, My Lads| 


Resurrected From the 1871 Files of 
THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION 


BY FUZZY WOODRUFF 


We can laugh at the summer furs 
and the winter skimpiness of the fash- 
ionable dress of today, but it wouldn’t 
be surprising to find that a woman 


has always been a.woman, as far as 
her blind obedience. to the decree of 
fashion is. concerned. ; 


Certaifily, the New York ¢orrespond- 
ent of The Constitution, writing of 
tha winter styles of the new year of 
1872, gives 10 indication that he 
thought our grandmothers@were dress- 
ing in anything like a safe, sane and 
conservative way. 

He admits that their clothes were 


beautiful and gorgeous and attractive, 


of course, for clothes worn by femi- | 


ninity have ever been all of that to 


the men of the age, but he points out | 


the unreasonableness of the wear in 
no uncertain terms. 
Here is his fashion letter: 


Winter Fashions 
Summery in 1872. 


“Winter fashions, for several 
years past, might just as well 
have been designed for spring, 
autumn, or even summer, In fact, 
they came to us after being used 
up in the latter seasons abroad, 
and were simply adopted by be- 
ing put into thicker fabrics than 
the original garments. 

“We are not much better off 
this season, so far as imported 
designs are concerned. We still 
have the short jackets, the small 
slashed paletots made heavy with- 
out warmth, by thick ornamen- 


the polonaise, which has been 


tal embroidery, and, in addition, | 


made to. serve every possible in 


= * 


and outdoor use, since it was in- 
vented. There is a comfort this 
season, however, that we have not 
always had, in an appearance at 
least of warmth. - Woolen fabrics, 
warmer colors, and the many and 
various uses to which fur is put, 

“ render the general aspect of the 
ladies dressed for a winter proin- 
enade more appropriate § and, 
therefore, more becoming and at- 
tractive, for nothing kills beauty 
more effectually than cold and a 
sense of discomfort. 


Full Dress Night 


_At Grand Opera. 


“The opera season has so far 
“been more successful than any we 
have had for the past ten years, 
It has revived the old tradition of 
the full dress night of the Acad- 
emy, when ladies wore invaluable 
trains and stomachers, and gentle- 
men did not venture in the pres- 
ence of ladies without white kids, 
pumps and dress coats. 

“The spectacle of a full dress 
night is best seen from the boxes 
forming the upper tier, and it is 
really worth vhile to endure the 
heat and close, stuffy atmosphere 
occasionally for the sake of seeing 
the gorgeous display around and 
below. here is no powdered 
hair, much less false hair, worn 
than last season, and few elab- 
erate headdresses are to be seen; 
but the toilettes are often mag- 
nifieent and, in fact. must be. to 
be distinguished in a crowd when 
all are well and more are elegant- 
ly dressed.”

BITS OF NEW YORK LIFE 


M’INTYRE 


New York, January 2.—The pas- 
sion for publicity in New York car- 
ries its seekers into strange paths. It 
is a fashion now for men seeking the 
white hot glare deftly to engineer 
public dinners for themselves and then 
stand feigning breathless surprise 
when brought to the festal board. 

Three such dinners have been given 
this winter. For one the “guest of 
honor” beught 250 tickets. He sat 
tugging a vagrant lock, surcharged 
with artistic absent-mindednegs while 
poet “of praise fell from forensic 
ips. 

When called upon to reply to the 
toasts of the evening he came: out of 
the. nebulous nether and groped his 
way back to the cosmic snarl with 
halting phrases. It was, as the actor 
would say, “a great bit of trouping.” 
He could not understand why all this 
fuss had been made about one so un- 
important. Secaldinig tears trickled 
down his cheeks. 

And many of those puffed with the 
privilege of paying $10.50 a ticket 
went away feeling a new admiration 
for this gentle, unaffected, artistic 
soul, so modest, so shy and a couple 
of et ceteras. It is the New York 
way to beam over being bunked. 

The “We Boys” who used to clut- 
ter up the Peacock alleys of the gild- 
‘ed hotels found: their easiest pluck- 
ings among those who feigned timid- 
e in — yet fairly leaped to the

theater a prison band blared tunes 
of jazz and sentiment. Boats in the 
river sounded fog sirens to swell the 
noise. A motor car with a passen-

world—stopped. along the banks at 
Sutton Place and . wistfully out 
across the river. In the vast prison 
yard was his son—in a suit of gray.

‘and 


tion, 
Is Your Hearing Perfect? 

Perhaps if we realized our own 
chances of joining those whose joys 
ure thus curtailed, we might be more 
considerate. in an article on the suv- 
ject 1 saw the other day that one in 
ten is ‘to some extent hard of hearing 
and that the proportion increases 
every year. Many people who are 
somewhat deaf in one ear do not real- 
ize it until something affects the 
hearing in the other ear. 

Of course no one who has any de- 
cency at-all deliberately makes fun of 
‘he hard of hearing, but there are 
many ways of being considerate be- 
sides refraining from such obvious bru- 
tality. 

One can mitigate that left-out-feel- 
ing by drawing the deaf person into 
«he conversation by addressing a word 
or two to him that will give him the 
keynote and help him to follow. 

Making It Easier fer the Deaf. 

One can draw his attention by a 
yesture or a touch so that he will be 
paying attention to you, and then, by 
speaking distinctly, not covering the 
mouth with the Lands, not turning 
he face away or dropping the voice 
at the end of the paragraph, make it 
much easier for him to hear. 

Ore can refrain from shouting. 

One can take pains, when three or 
four are taking part in a conversa- 
tion, and one is hard ofehearing to 


address oneself directly to the deaf 


person, remembering that the others 
can hear anyhow. 
The finest example of consideration 
for the hard of hearing I ever heard 
was what a young woman engaged to 


a man thus hampered did. She stuffed © 


her ears with cotton to make herself 
just as deaf as her fiance and went 
about thus handicapped for one week. 
not trying to avoid any’ ordinary con- 
tacts. Perhaps the rest of us are not 
called upon to try this for a week but 
suppose we tried it just one day. I 
imagine we should find our sympathies 
for the hard of hearing evlJarged as 
nothing else could enlarge them.

CHAPTER XVII. 

Rasher’s walk with Mary Broox 
was the first of many. When his 
hours of work permitted he went with 
her up the long hill to her gateway, 
where he said good night and turned 
back to his boarding house with its 
smell of grease and stale tobacco 
smoke. 

If the secretary to the manager felt 
a difference in their station she gave 
no sign. She accepted him at his 
face value—a pleasant young man 
about whom there was a glamour of 
mystery. : 

“Are you wise in seeing so much of 
him?’ asked her mother. “You don't 
know anything about him, do you?” 

“No, mother, hardly anything, but 
I'm convinced he’s decent and honest. 
I like him and believe in him’—an 
answer that increased rather than al- 
layed her mother’s concern. 

Rasher’s acceptance into the full 
fellowship of friendship came when 
she usked if he would care to go witli 
he. to visit some of the poor families 
she was helping. ’ 

“You will see the insides of the lives 
many of these people live,” she said. 
Together they went, and in time he 
began to Share with her, though a 
lesser degrée, their kindly regards. 

Myterious events followed these vis- 
its. | 


Mrs, Levinsky, distressed to a shad- | 


ow by the illness of one of her seyv- 
en children, was made haypy by an 


/ unexpected visit from a strange doc- 


_ ~ 


' one she had ever seen him wear.

tor who effected a cure and asked no 
pay. 
The little Rashky girl, condemned 


| by a tedious iliness to a miserable bed 


everlooking a muddy courtyard, was 
restored to health by the same un- 
known doctor. 

Old Biskoff, broken down after years 
of service, was amazed one day to 
find near his doorstep a purse con- 
taining considerable money, the own- 
er of which could not be found. 

Gradually there grew among the 
people of the mills a curious, halt 
superstitious belief in Harry Rasher. 
By mysterious means which baffled 
understanding his personality became 
invested in their simple minds with 
strange attributes. 

“Do you know,” said Mary Brook 
one day, “they are beginning to look 
upon youasasymbol of good fortune, 
Why? You never give them any- 
thing or help them much.” 

Rasher shrugged his shoulders. 

“I’d like to do a lot for them— if 
I could,” he answered. “They are 
so grateful. Mrs. Levinsky offered 
to patch my coat today, and -yester- 
day when my room rent was overdue 
the landlady whispered that if I was 
hard up not to worry about the rent.” 

Miss Brook noted the worn coat and 
her eyes softened. It was the = 

e 
must be very oor. She had an im- 
pulse to supplement Mrs. Levinsky’s 
kind offer, but feared she might 
wound his pride. 


—_ 


Impressions spread swiftly in a com- 
munity whose interests are bound up 
in a single concern. Workmen be- 
gan quietly observing Rasher. From 
their families came queer stories 
about the good luck that followed his 
visits. 

These stories soon reached Mr. 
Stabb. Ever since the day when his 
head still swimming from the blow 
Rasher had struck, he.had seen his 


secretary and the truck driver go.off. 


together he had nursed a double griev- 
ance. That he had not discharged thé 
man was something he could net. ex- 
plain even to himself. 


Now, however, Mr. Stabb deter- 
mined to act. Rasher must be gotten 
out of town before his hold upon the 
imaginations ot the people became a 
menace. But first he must be dis- 
credited, humiliated, and stripped of 
his glamour. Mr. Stabb sent for a 
man who had in the past executed 
many devious commissions for him. 

“Tony,” he said, “you know this 
man Rasher who drives a truck?’ 

“Sure,” answered Tony; “he loafs 
around the Popular Poolroom in the 
evenings. A quiet duck.” 

“Well,” said Mr. Stabb, “there’s 
something queer about him. I don’t 
know what he’s up to, but I believe 
he’s dangerous. He must be run out 
of town.” 

“What you’ say goes,” remarked 
Tony, confidently. “That bird will 
be glad to get out of town before I’m 
through with him.” 


Dancing Party. 

A delightful social event of the past

You’ve probably heard of this well- 
known plan of making caqugh syrup 
at home. But have you ever used 
it? Thousands of families, the world 
over, feel that they could hardly keep 
house without it. It’s simple and 
cheap, but the way it takes hold of a 
cough will soon earn it a permanent 
place in your home. bs 

Into a pint bottle, pour 24% ounces 
of Pinex; then add plain granulated 
sugar syrup to fill up the pint. Or, 
if desired, use clarified molasses, 
honey, or corn syrup, instead of sugar 
syrup. Either way, it tastes ood, 
never spoils, and gives you a full pint 
of better cough remedy than you 
could buy ready-made for three times 
its cost. , s 

It is really wonderful how quickly 
this home-made remedy conquers & 
cough—usually in 24 hours or less. 
It seems to pasts through every 
air passage, loosens a dry, hoarse or 
tight cough, lifts the phlegm, b 
the membranes, and gives almost im- 
mediate relief. Splendid for throat 
tickle, hoarseness, croup, bronchitis 
and bronchial asthma. © ag

The white beach under a bright syn

art, putting ourselves in our gay col- 
orings against the brilliancy of sea, 
sky and foliage. So it is to the beach 
that the gorgeously colored capes go. 
They have every ear mark of success 
for several months to come. 

Whether they were inspired by that 
numberless mass of Russians who are 
in Paris, who are bringing the splen- 
did tones of the steppes and frozen 
lakes to the dressmaking business of 
France, or whether the colors come 
about from a national and determined 
effort to banish black from costumery, 
who knows? The influence of the ti- 
tled Russians who have found places 
in the designing rooms of Paris is 
worth a story that could be inserted 
in the history of all exiles who have 
impressed their manners and customs 
upon those who have received them. 
It is a story of vast importance to 
those who study migrations and their 
effect on the land upon which they 
fasten. Mr. Wells’ “Outline of His- 
tory” is built on such stories. This 
one promises to be interesting. Its 
first effect is seen in the clothes 
which France is sending to America, 
and in the furthermost reaches of this 
continent a woman will soon be wear- 
ing a colorful Bakst overblouse be- 
cause a Russian princess, nearly 
starving, stitched away in an attic 
on a garment that represented Holy 
Russia. 

Do not be indifferent to the fact 
that the Russian epoch is upon us, 
It will show itself in literature, in 
fashions, in dancing, in commerce. 
The success of “The Grand Duke” 
as played by the Guitrys in Paris 
and by Lionel Atwell ine New York 
shows the wind direction. The great 
nobles of Russia, in exile in Paris, 
are beginning to have the same effect 
on the creative world that the French _ 


had after the French reyo. 
lution. 4 
-It may sound tike a far cry from 
. green and red cape on the sands 
to a starving Russian princess in 4 
Paris attic, but a close link joing the 
two. France is making Russi 
clothes the fashion of the hour, esg¥. 
cially those whieh carry out the gm. 
uine Russian designs and embroj@- 
eries. The extraordinary  suecegs 
Chanel has had with the genuine Rus. 
sian overbleuse she  introductj 
through this new influence shows 
whither fashion tends. A cape of the 
hour is built by Jenny and its bright 
green surface is enhanced by a huge 
rosette of brick red wool loops why 
catches the turnover collar. The frOck 
that goes with it is bright green jer- 
sey and the airplane hat is brick red 
felt. These colors are Russian. There 
are other capes for white frocks. whi 
are made after the manner of the 
things Bakst invented for the ballet 
when it was placed in Russia, such as 
that strange and infinitely sad dance 
by peasants under the midnight syn 
in a snow-covered village. . 
Rodier’s perllaines which can 
bought in this country, a fabric wh®h 
is patterned with bright red and 
white or green and white checks, is 
made up into these mew capes. If ope 
wants to be more unusual, there are 
wide Russian embronderies, in thread 
or applied cloth which can be inserted 
into the cape at shoulders, down the 
side seams, around the hem. ° 
No one need have any doubts @@ 
cerning the strong right that is put 
up against black. {[t will grow in

is the first time, prohably, that th 
public has been so well organiz®d 
in its opposition to the dressmakers 
and cloth weavers. The public does 
not talk and puts out no propaganda, 
but it acts. Its action is disconcert- 
ing. Little by little the dressmakes 
are winning out, and such things gs 
the vivid capes are obstacles throt¥n 
in front of the footsteps of those whe 
tread the black path. If women ac- 
cept these coverings for the smart 
beaches in winter, they may realize 
that it is time to take up colors.

T oday’s Short Story 


BY GEORGE T. BYE 
Illustrated by Arlene Coyle 


IN MADELEINE’S ROOM. 


With a singular lapse of mind that 
he made his way back to the hotel. 
Then the first coherent thought struck 
him. Why not? There was nothing 
wrong about it. No one need know. 

To the clerk on duty he addressed 
himself : | 

“Miss Madeleine Beamish was a 
guest here Jast night. I just saw her 
to the station. She believes she left 
a bar-pin in her room. If you will 
give me the key, I will make a search 
for it.” 


“T can send a boy up for you,” said | 


the clerk. 

“No, I prefer to look myself,” Jay 
persisted. He got the key. : 

In Madeline’s room he was intox? 
cated with an exhilaration that had all 
the joy of a great triumph. She had 
breathed the fragrant air of this rvom’ 
The glorious girl had caused that po- 

Until the train finally vanished | 
around a curve, with a little flutter of 
engine and coaches that was like a 
Hayde, he was an- 
chored to the station platform with feet 
and heart weightier than lead. 

She was gone—Madeleine, the only 
girl. She bad seemed glad to go. Her 

es had sparkled with a luster that 
diamonds might envy. She had 
laughed with the lark: it was earlier 
than 7 o’clock in the morning, and it 
was a laugh to be compared for its 
purity and music with the sound of 
rippling water. She had wriggled and 
ski and igged all the way to her 
es seat. e, on the contrary, had 
been as doleful as a crow. 

It was all over. She would never 
know him as he really was. She would 
carry away a recollection of a “gloomy 
mutt,” ashe described himself savage- 
ly. She would not suspect that it was 
she who had made him so’dumb, so 


stupid, so wooden, so awkward,—so

Was built by W. K Vanderbilt for his 
‘@eughter Consuelo, then Duchess of 
riborough, is in the market. Its 
Wriginal cost was in the neighbor- 

of a million dollars, and its

"that figure.

Horbidding exterior Sunderland house

rivaled among the palaces of Europe. 

With all this magnificence, how- 
ever, there was little doing.in the 
strictly social. sense under Duchess 
Consuelo’s regime. {stranged from 
the duke, whom she eventually di- 
vorced, she lived for public welfare 
and good works, and the sumptuous 
apartments of Sunderland house were 
more often thronged with charity or- 
ganizers than with social butterflies. 

When the duchess was a candidate 
in London’s municipal election she 
held her committee meetings at Sun- 
derland house. 


During the war tl: mansion was 
commandered by the government for 
departmental offices, and after the 
urmistice it became the London head- 


quarters of the league of nations. 

Nowadays the x-duchess is plain 
Mme. de Balsan and lives in Paris 
since her marriage last July to a 
wealthy French manufacturer. . The 
new duchess, who has no title to Sun-

| EASY JUGGLING 


LESSON 7 


Rasso, on@ of the most widely 
known professional jugglers, 
has prepared a series of ten 
lessons in easy juggling espe- 
cially for the readers of this 
newspaper. This is the sey- 
enth lesson. Another one next 
week. 


a 


Plate Spinning. 

For the sake of mother’s china set, 
I urge you to practice plate spinning 
with a mattress or some equally soft 
covering on the floor beneath you. If 
you do not you should go to the pot- 
ter and demand a commission. 

A large soup plate should be used 
to praetice with. It is deeper and 
therefore not so likely to slip off tie 
spinning stick. 

At the hardware store purcnase a 
dowel stick about two feet long. A 
common stick of wood, cut round, well 
sandpapered and just a bit thicker 
than a lead pencil, will do. 

On one end of the stick place an 
eraser such as may be purchased at a 
few cents tor the tip of a pencil that 


originally had no eraser. You are 
now ready to start spinning. 


How It’s Done. 


Hold the soup plate inverted In 
your left hand if you are right-handed, 
or in your right hand if you are left- 
handed. Jlold the spinning stick in 
the other hand with the rubber-tipped 
end in the edge of the bowl of the 
plate. The stick should be held at a 
slant, for the hand holding it must be 
directly under the center of the. plate. 

Cross the arms as the boy in the 
picture is doing. With the hand that 
holds the plate. give the plate a swift 
turn. The rubber-tipped end of the 
stick should not slip, but should turn 
with the plate. It is the stick that 
keeps the plate revolving. 

Do not move the stick with a churn- 


STARTING 
e. 
SPIN~ 


ing of your whole arm. A wrist move- 
ment should be used. 

At first the plate mav slide off the 
stick, and perhaps you will come to 
the conclusion that plate spinning 
sisn’s worth the time needed to learn 
it. But with two or three days’ prac- 
tice you should be able to spin plates 
almost like a veteran juggler. 

Use Old Pilates. 

Once you do succeed in getting the 

plate to spin. you will find that the 
spinning stick comes closer and closer 
to the center of the plate, until it is 
in the exact center, and that then 
the plate revolves so rapidly and even- 
ly that, to an observer. it is not spin- 
ning at all, but is still and perfectly 
balanced on the end of the stick. The 
effect is similar to that shown. in the 
middle figure of the picture above. 
* Mother may be very much against 
having you practice with her good 
plates, For this reason use old ones— 
cracked ones, if you have them. And 
remember that the heavier the plate, 
the easier it is to spin it. Because 
the wrist soon tires of spinning a 
heavy plate, make your practice pe- 
riods short. 

In our, eighth lesson next week the 
spinning of a cloth on a stick will be 
explained.

Do you remember the fun you had 
blowing one bubble inside of another? 
Perhaps you tried some tricks of your 
own. Well here’s one you surely did 
not think of. 

Take a chrysanthemum or any large 
flower you can get. Dip it into the 
soap bubble solution. Now with your 
funnel you can blow a bubble right 
on the flower. Do the trick and see 
what happens to the flower. Did you 
ever think of what « nice bubble pipe 
a tin horn makes? Try it. Blow eas- 
ily at first. After you’ve made. a 
good bubble, blow harder. You. will 
have good music coming through the 
bubble. R. ¢ RIBBLER.

Who’s Who in the Story. 


Jeanne Dare, known in the little 
Iowa town whence she came as plain 
Jane Dare, has set herself up in New 
York as a wealthy woman in the hope 
of -snaring a rich husband. In this 
effort she is making use of 

Richard Canby, well-known man 
about town. Canby invites Jeanne 
to a dinner together with 

Mrs. Adele Parkinson, a widow and 
former flame of his. At dinner she 
meets 

Vie Barstowe, heir to the reputed 
millions, who shows signs of infatu- 
ation with her 
' Signor Bonnicetti, a famous violin- 
ist, asks only to serve Jeanne, and she 
uses him as a drawing card to her tea 
party. ; 

Adele foils Victor Barstowe’s  at- 
tempt to linger for a tete-a-tete with 
Jeanne. 

As Jeanne is starting for a dinner 
engagement, Henry Harrison tele- 
phones. 

He informs Jeanne that he can bor- 
row nothing on her worthless land. 

Selby North, gossipng, eldery 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barstowe’'s 
many flirtations. 

Harrison comes to breakfast to ar- 
range for the transfer of propery, 
and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents him as a business ac- 
quaintance. 

Canby offers a “market tip” as a 
means for Jeanne to make some 
money, and Jeanne, troubled by credi- 
tors, is tempted to invest. — 


Installment No. 17. 


CAUGHT IN 
A FALSEHOOD. 

Madame -Julie ‘motioned Jeanne ® 
a commodious chair beside a hearth 
— a little wood fice snapped cheer- 
ily. . 

The room was exquisitely done in 
grey and rose like the gown salon 
in front, but it had the additional] 
touch of a real personality. There 
were a few good pictures on the silver- 
gruy walls, well-bound books in a 
rack on the gray enameled desk, a 
gleam of copper on the tea table under 
the rose-shaded lamp. Except for 
some business-like files within reach 
of the desk chair, there was no sug- 
gestion of an office in Madame Julie’s 
sanctum, 

It was from this file cabinet that 
the Frenchwoman drew a folder: It, 
too, was gray and had the fourth let- 
ter of the alphabet done in silver in 
its upper right-haud corner. 

“You will pardon me, Mees Dare,” 
s:id Madame suavely, “but several 
time my statements have been sub- 
mitted to You, and there is nothing 
forthcoming. Not sufficient, that is! 
If you will be so good—” 

She pushed .a_ blank checkbook 
deftly forward and held out a silver 
fountain pen. 

BOWING TO 
THE INEVITABLE. 

Jeanne’s first impulse was to be in- 
dignant at this high-handed method 
of securing payment on an accouny 
long overdue. But the Frenchwoman’s 
black eyes were intrepid. There was a 
firmness to her thin crimson tips 
that Jeanne knew brooked no eva- 
sion. 

If she did not pay something on her 
account, there would ‘be no delivery 
ot the blue brocade gown on the mor- 
row. 

And Jeanne needed that gown to as- 
Sist in the capture of Victor Barstowe. 
She kngw that she was exquisite in 
that particular creation. Few women 
could have worn vhat pale glittering 
blue, but it turned Jeanne’s flesh to 
warm ivory, and her blonde hair to 
molten gold. It brought out violet 
lights in her eyes. 

If she had .been attractive to °, Bar- 
stowe in the black gown she had 
worn at Canby’s dinner, her feminine 
Sixth sense told her that she would 
be irresistible in the blue brocade. 

She accepted the pen from Madame 
Julie’s fingers and mechanically wrote 
a check on her own bank for more 
than half the amount of her outstand- 
ing bill. 

After all, since the deposit of Harri- 
son’s check for the sale of her prop- 
erty. “ie could afford to draw a sub- 
stantial amount! 

Madame glanced at the check Jeanne 
handed her and was immediately gra- 
cious and suave saleswoman again, 
The coldness faded from her eyes. She 
unbent immediately. 

“Merci! Mees Dare is most kind. 
I regret that I have to ask for some- 
thing on account, but,” she shrugged, 
“IT am a business woman. Mees Dare 
know what I must lose in the natural 
course of business. 

Jeanne murmured something about 
the account having completely — es- 


ee eee 


ing: won her pdint, assured her that 
| uite realized that—without the 
flicker. of an eyelash to betray that 
she knew her fair customer was lying. 


IMPRESSING 
MADAME. 


“Come, I have something for you 
to see!’ urged Madame, leading. the 
way into the salon. “A most. lovely 
thing has just arrive from Paris. 
it, Mees Dare will be ravishing.”- 

She was darting toa cabinet, but 
Jeanne stopped her laughingly.’ 

“The blue brocade will be enough 
for today, Madame. Don’t tempt me 
with anything more. Besides I’m late 
for tea. I'll come in next week and 
see the the new gown.” 

“Ah, but next week it may be 
gone,” said Madame sadly shaking 
her head. “Some fat lady, she look 
at it this morning. ink she buy 
it tomorrow. Ah, what hips! What 
a sacrilege!” 

But Jeanne still shook her head 
and refused to be tempted by even a 
glance at the gown. 

“But why?” urged Madame. “Mees 
Dare have plenty money.’\ Her glane 
swept her customer’s modish form. 

“But Madame, my money is in- 
vested: I carry very little eash in the 
bank,” explained Jeanne. She went 
on to talk glibly but vaguely about 
certain holdings. 

Madame, not understanding, as 
Jeanne carefully figured she would 
not, was none the less impressed. 

It was with a feeling of satisfac- 
tion that Jeanne made her way to the 
Biltmore where Canby waited, an im- 
pressively opulent figure in his great 
fur coat. Several crimson-lipped, 
bobbed-haired young persons looked en- 
viously at Jeanne as Canby rose to 
greet her. He wore his financial rat- 
ing as carelessly but as obviously as 
his gloves. 

JEANNE PAYS 
IN ADVANCE. f 

Because she had made a_ large 
hole in her bank account by the check 
for Madame Julie, Jeanne brought the 
conversation around to Canby’s sug- 
gestion of the morning that she in- 
vest in some market proposition of 


his. 

He talked to her for some time about 
it. It was as intelligible as Greek 
to her, but she decided to try it and 
gave him a check to cover the pur- 
chase of stock, 

He demurred at the check, declar- 
ing that it was time enough to pay 
him after the deal‘ was complete, but 
Jeanne was adamant on that score. 

She had none of the qualities pop- 
ularly assigned to the gold-digger, 
she told herself. It did not enter into 
her scheme of things to accept money 
or gifts of value from a man. On 
this principle, she fortified herself. 
She would accept the attention which 
money would buy in the guise of din- 
ners, dances, teas, flowers; but be- 
yond that point she never went. She 
would borrow on a man’s prestige for 
her own social entree. She would 
draw on his position for her own ad- 
vancement, but she refused all tan- 
cible, material benefits to be derived 
from her .wealthy acquaintances. 

Canbv gave in good humoredly, and 
thrust her check into a vest pocket. 
Jeanne had piqued him again by her 
insistence, 

None of the women he knew, even 
the wealthy ones, would have insisted 
on paying in advance. Among most 
of his acquaintarces he knew that 
if the investment in which he vol- 
untarily assumed financial risk should 
turn out badly. the matter would 
never be referred to thereafter, wheth- 
er the initial cost of the stock had 
been paid or not. 

Jeanne was a new specimen to Can- 
by. He found his attempt at analy- 
sis so fascinating that he detained 
her on one pretext or another until 
they were hoth late in returning to 
dress for their evening engagements. 
FACE 
TO FACE. 

On the way out of the hotel to 
Canby’s car an _ incident occurred 
which caused Jeanne a momentary 
qualm. 

She was descending the wide stair- 
way leading to the Forty-third street 
entrance, when, in the ascending

Her quick smile asknowledged his 
bow, but there “was no answering 


smile in his brilliant gray eyes. He 
passed on with his party. 

Canby chuckled. 

“Young Vic didn’t look any too

think the youngster’s got quite a 
crush on you!” 

Jeanne was puzzled by that unsmil-

a party of his own. He couldn't 
have_left them and dashed away to 
greet’ her, she argued. Besides, the 
chance encounter didn’t warrant any 
more than a bow. But the absence 
of that ready smile of his— .

cold feeling around the region of her 
heart that she had refused to let him

an engagement with— 

Who was it she had named? 


It seemed to her dimly that she had 
mentioned tke Barclays as her hosts. 
Or was it the Evans? 

Whomever she had named, it had 
not been Canby. 

Barrtowe’s’ finding her with Canby 
at the tea hour would be doubly sig- 
nificant. It would look to the former 
as though she had deliberately fibbed 
to avoid his call. And it would also 
seem that Canby was the favored 
suitor. 

This was the lat impression Jeanne 
wanted to have bruited about!

Interested Reader: If you have 
auburn hair you have a tendency to- 
wards ‘freckling that you will find 

not e, to cure. 


. The action of the 
sun is to draw little deposits of pig- 
ment to the surface of the skin, which 
show up as freckles. If the face is 
shaded, not so many fgeckles will 
appear. therefore wearing wide-brim- 
med hats with a dark lining is ad- 
visable in the summer time. 

A splendid shampoo for auburn hair 
is made by mixing one ounce of henna 
with three ounces of powdered castile 


soap. About a heaping tablespoonful . 


of this is used for every shampoo. 
This is lathered on the scalp and al- 
lowed to remain about 15 minutes, 
then rinsed off thoroughly. If your 
hair is oily, it will be improved by 
being shaken out and given sun baths 
occasionally. The girl fortunate enough 
to possess auburn hair must be un- 
usually careful in her choice of col- 
ors. She will look wonderful in black 
satin or velvet, in French blue or rose 
pink, soft greens and rich shades of 
brown. She must never wear any 
ordinary color. Pearl gray or laven- 
der will also look well on her.

Central of Georgia Railway Reviews Conditions 
of 1921---Discusses Outlook for 1922 


The railways of the United States, par ticularly those operating in the agricultural

This con stion was not due to anything unsound oP(it

aftermath of war, and a condition not unexpected in the transition from a war-time to 


The outlook for 1922, while not so encouraging as the railways could wish, never-

industry in adapting themselves to changed c onditions. !

permanency. Such conditions must be met with determination, courage and co-operation. 


Because transportation is a vital factor in American business the public is entitled 
to know the results of the period just closed, the main devélopments in the situation, 


and the plans of railway management for the coming year. 


The figures for the whale of 1921 are n ot complete, but for the first nine months the 
earnings of American railroads * iounted to slightly less than 3 per cent per annum upon 
the valuation of their propertiés. In the Southern territory the return was slightly less 
ihan 2 per cent, because freight rates in the South were advanced less than ia other sec- 
tions. This result was in spite of a reduction of 20 per cent in operating expenses and a re- 
duction in force of at least half a million railw ay workers, and of other drastic economies. 


It may be argued that during a pericd-of readjustment, a return of 3 per cent 
upon railroad capital is not unreasonably Ic w, but as a matter of fact the 3 per cent 
return upon the entire property value is not sufficient to pay interest on outstanding 
bonds, and, therefore, leaves nothing on the average for stock. The public should also 
remember that during the same period when most industries enjoyed large profits and 
madey extensive plant betterments, the railways were limited by the government to a 
normal return on their property investment. 
tion of surplus to tide the transportation companies over the period of readjustment 
through which we are now passing. 

The situation is discouraging in other respects: The report of the Interstate Com- 
merce Commission for the year reveals the fact that it received forty applications from 
carfiers to abandon property, and that auth ority was actually granted for the abandon- 
ment of 702 miles of road. Within recent months three railways in Georgia have been 
dismantled and others are in bad financial condition. 


In view of all these facts the insistent public demand for a reduction in’rates has 
Nevertheless, the demand has been so general and so strong that 
the railway executives have during the year granted many concessions. Amor 
of importance to shippers in the Southern territory was the enlarged milling-in-transit 
privileges on corn, concessions in peach rates, and the adjustment of many other rates

their old spirit of loyalty and efficiency, conceived upon a new foundation of public 
service. The public is taking a more intelli gent interest in railway affairs.

from home, 

A ecent of ether spread its sickly 
pungency through the ward... It em- 
anated from behind-the screen, a kind 
of reeking aftermath from the op- 
erating table. Came, too, a hoarse 
and broken groaning. broken by & 
cough. Then a faint plea arose: 

“Water! Water!’ 

The soothing voice of the proba- 
tioner, behind the screen, denied the 
prayer: 

“I’m sorry, but you can’t have wae

“TI gotta have a drink—I’m dyin’

“Water—just a drop; just a drop!” 

“I'd give it to you if I could,” an- 
swered Sylvia. “You know, after

ed Lalia, “with me ready to cash

harm done, but I'd like to see Dan.” 
A great eagerness’ quivered in the 
weakening voice. “Dan, he’s a wise 
guy, all right, an’ he sticks. He knows 
the ropes, too. I think he’s slicker 
than Meiny, though it was Meiny 
put me up to that last deal, mostly— 
him an’ old man Stagg; the cagy old 
buzzard!” 

The wandering of her mind now 
for u» moment seemed to have given 
place to rationality again. A change, 
subtle yet real, had come upon that 
wasted face. With an agonizing ef- 
fort the woman raised herself a lit- 
tle on her right elbow. Bony, stark, 
hideous, she stared at Sylvia. 


“Tell me!’ she gulped. ‘Tell me 
somethin’ !” 

“Well, what is it?” asked the gir), 
@ little shaken in spite of all her 
strength. She sat down in a chair 
by the bedside and looked fixedly at 
the woman of the streets and slums. 
Good and.evil faced each other there; 
purity and soilure peered into each 
other’s eyes. “What do you want to 
know? I'll tell you anything I can.” 

“D’you—d'you think there's any 
way | could get forgiven?’ 

“For what?’ 

“For our last deal. That was rot- 
ten! I’ve pulled my share of deals 
across, in my time, an’ that was all 
right, too: but the last one—say! 
That was drawin’ it too damn strong. 
An’ I'd like to know if I could get 
forgiven, kind of.” 

“A terrible earnestness burned in 
her fading eyes, like the last coals 
of a dying bed of embers. 

“How can [ tell,” asked Sylvia. 
“unless I know what the deal was?” 

“That’s right, too,’’ huskily answer- 
ed Lalia, her voice breaking weakly 
as she gulped for breath. She paused 
a moment as if mustering her last 
reserves of force. “Old man Stagg— 
that Meiny’s old gent—put us up to 
it. So he'll have to stand part of 
the blame, won't he? I’m only won- 
dering if I can square my part.’ 

“What was your part?” Tell me, it 
it will make you feel better.” 

“Mine? Oh, I done a lot. It was 
a plant, you see, to queer a straight 
girl. A rich old guy named Vinton, 
up in the Back Bay, somewhere, want- 
ed her done up. ’cause his son was 
fallin’ for her strong, an’ wanted to 
marry her. all right and proper. But 
he—the old guy—wouldn’t stand for 
it, so——” 


“What?” choked Sylvia, her eyes 


“Oh, I helped Meiny frame it good. |: 
{ was the one that got wise to hér kid}: 


brother, in the country. It was her 
brother, all thea, time, see? 
way we fixed it, showin’ she wads send- 
in’ kale to keep him, made it look like 
somethin’ else.” 
“You—you did that?’ 
Sylvia. “It was you?” 
“Yes,” answered Lalia, her voice 
growing weaker with the effort of con- 
fession. “An’ I helped get an affidavy 
swore to, that she was took out of a 
huuse on Dover street, when it was 
pinched. ‘That was just after she 
come to Boston.” lLalia spoke, now, 
with fevered energy, as if the last 
flames were burning to extinction, 
“Took out in a faid. Pulled, you 
know. It was trué, too. Gospel. But 
she didn’t know -what kind of a dump 
it was, when she hired a room there, 
She just blew in from Gloucester. 
Looked in the paper for a room, an’ 
got that one. Gree ngirl. Didn't 


>tumble; wasn’t wise to Boston nor the 


gume, neither. Good girl; straight.” 

She paused, choking for breath; her 
hands twitched unsteadily and caught 
at Sylvia's. 

“But when the house was pinched, 
they took her to the Black Maria, 
same us all the kites. Put that ‘with 
the other tfing bout the kid; an’ my 
Gawd! what an affidavy it made! It 
could be swore to as gospel; couldn’t 
it ?’’ 

Sylvia had begun to tremble, as 
with a sudden chill; but still she mas- 
tered herself. 

“D’you think—I can—get forgiv- 
en?’ whispered Lalia with burning 
eagerness. “Can 1? Can 1?’ 

Syivia leaned above her, yearning 
with-the compassion of that divine, 
immortel spirit of womanhood which 
wove the fabrics of her soul. 

“Yes,” answered she, as the outcast, 
spent and gasping, yielded in her arins 
und laxly sank back on the pillow. 
“You can be, and you are. I know 
you are forgiven. Go in peace!’ 

At this same hour, when the out- 
cast woman of the streets lay dying 
in the compassionate arms of the girl 
she had so wronged and ruined, Muggs 
Rafferty—his pride and ire al]  in- 
flamed by Meiny’s deft indictments— 
was nearing the doors of the Little 
Haven, on conquest bent.

“That’s a very creditable perform-

ford, “but I have no time, now, to

“T will like hell!” cried Muggs, ad- 
vancing with the battle gleara in his 
eyes, “Yuh shook down a friend 0’ 
mine, here, tonight—frisked him of 
some valuable papers. Then yuh trun 
him out on his bean. An’ you're

he advanced. Still Bradford's smile 
did not depart; but it grew hard and 
dangerous. 


feet, as formerly in the college gym- 
nasium, shuffled slightly on the floor, 
assuring their position. 

Suddenly Muggs rushed, bull-like, 
and smote. The blow would have an- 
nihilated Bradford, had it carried 
home: but it did not carry. Bradford 
was not there. A side-step cleared 
the attack. The watchers saw his 
right fist flash and the left leap up-

His eyes, too, glinted with 
a certain steely light. His fists knotted | 
as he measured the distance; and his 


ward. They heard two sounds like 
those produced by a mallet hitting a 
qugrter of beef. 

aring, Muggs staggered and plung- 
ed down. The ex-champion rolled in 
the sawdust and lay quivering. 

“Water, here!” directed Bradford, 
kneeling beside the fallen one. “Wa- 
ter! Towels !” Deftly. Bradford 
washed the blood from the rotgh’s torn 
mouth and chin, holding the ugly head 
upon his knee. 

Presently Muggs opened a blank eye. 

“Gee!” he croaked. “Gee!” 

“Sure you don’t want any encore?” 
Bradford inquired, still smiling. 

“Nuttin’ do-in’! Me for de out- 
side !” 

Muggs, releasing himself from Brad- 
ford’s administration, got slowly and 
painfully to his feet. He stood there a 
moment, unsteadily. Then something 
like a grin spread slowly over his 
harsh countenance, and he put out his 
hand. 

“Say,” he remarked, “I started 
somethin’ pretty raw jus’ now. T’ink 
yuh can ferget it? I was ip wrong, 
an’ I wanta make good. Slip us yer 
mitt, will yuh?’ 

Bradford’s hand clasped his. 

“That’s all over now, and forgot- 
ten,” he answered, smiling. 

“Mean dat, on de level?’ 

“Surest thing you know, Muggs!” 

“Gee! Some guy! Well, guess I'll 
blow now. S’long!” 

“Hold on—wait a minute!” Brad- 
ford detained him, while the onlookers 
stared ———

“Are you open to a proposition 
“A which?’ And Muggs blinked with 
wonderment, rubbing his bruised chin. 
“An offer. It’s this way, you see. 
I’m planning to start a kind of gym- 
nasium here. Athletics, boxing, wres- 
tling and al] that. I need a good 
man to take charge. Want the job?” 

“Tob?’ 

“Yes, as instructor in physical eul- 
ture. You’re good, all right: I can see 
that.” Muggs’ shoulders straightened 
a bit and his chest expanded. “You're 
still hard. My hand aches like sin, 


where I landed on your jaw. And if 
you’d connected with that wallop you 
put over at me——” “ 

“Gee!” murmured Muggs, grinning. 

“But, of course, you realize you were 
better once than you are now,” 
tinued Bradford. “You're bady off 
your training. Too much booze, old 
man, and too much of other things. 
Your wind’s gone, I should judge, and 
da all of fifty pounds overweight.

“Think I e’d come back?” asked the 
ex-champion, anxiously. 

“Sure thing! And at the same time 
you're doing it, you can take charge 
of my new gym. It won't be elabo- 
rate, but it will be a agp toward 
a better one. You can fit it up as 
you think proper, direct it—I give you 
a free hand—and train such of the 
men here as want to be trained. Take 
the position?” 

“Me? Yuh mean me?’ stammered 
Muggs, dumbfounded, as he blinked at 
Vinton with uncomprehending eyes. 

“You’re the guy I’m sing.”

“Pay be “damned.” interrupted 
Muggs, his lips twitching oddly. “T

_ Washington, January 2.—Indica-

marked by a striking improvement in 
t-.e business and economic outlook” of 
the country and the world generally 
were discussed today by Comptroller 


_ {Gs the Currency Crissinger, in a fore- 


cast for 1922. 
_ There can be no doubt, Mr. Cris- 
Singer said, that “both the politica) 
and economic index figures” are rezgis- 
tering improvememt at this time, 
when political and economic eondi- 
tions so intimately interact.’ 
“Taking this wider view,” he 
added, “I feel that we may be justified 
in regarding the outlook as altogether 
re.ssuring and that the new year is 
coming to us with guarantees that 
justify the most optimistic forecasts,” 
_In the political domain. Mr. Cris- 
Singer described as predominating fa- 
vorable factors the limitation of arms 
conference and “the apparently in- 
sured settlement of the age-long con- 
froversy involving the relations of Ire- 
land to the United Kingdom.” . Al- 
ready, he declared, a betterment in the 
conditions of international exchange 
has taken place, adding that “no bet- 
ter index of widespread business con- 
ditions exists.” ) 


“In view of these accomplishments.” 
he continued, “we may anticipate con- 
fidently that the year 1922 will take 
its place in history as one of the land- 
marks in the record of human prog- 
ress, Men have turned their faces 
definitely in the right direction: they 
have set their feet in the paths to re- 
ae cp and prosperity: they

Every indication of favorable ont- 
come in these great underlying con- 


| siderations has been practically sim- 


ultaweous with a distinct turn for the 
better in the affairs of business and

which the commercial community has 
thus responded, is the most emphatic 
testimony to the readiness and the

Long in Front Rank. 


For many years she has been in the 
front rank in that body. ‘The elder 
Cameron was a leader in his day, and 
his son, who succeeded him, soon made 
his way to influence. 

Quay ranked with the successful 
politicians on the hill, while Penrose, 
a protege, reached higher committee 
assignments than his sponsor had ever 
secured. He became the nation’s most 
conspicuous political baron. 

Knox, with no political training, 
first reached the senate through a 
brief service in the. attorney-general- 
ship, but soon developed taste and tal- 
ent for legislative work, and at the

Penrose’s place in public affairs 
will never be filled, in the judgment

Miss Knight was the eldest daugh- 
ter of Dr. Lucian Lamar Knight, Geor- 
gia’s state historian, and of Mrs, 
Edith Nelson Knight. Her gvrand- 
father was the late Levi B. Nelson, one 
of Atlanta’s leading business. men

MANY ARE KILLED 
IN MINE CAVE-IN; 
17 BODIES FOUND 


3] Paso, Texas, January 2.—Seven- 
teen bodies were removed Saturday 
from the dump of the San Francisco 
del Oro mine near Parral, Chihuahua, 
where a cave-in occurred December 
28, burying a gang of workmen. 

News of the disaster was brought to 
El Paso by mining men here today 
from Parral. The number of dead 
is not known here, but it is reported 
there were no survivors of the gang 
working on the dump when tlie cave-in 
L occurred. 

The San Francisco del Oro is a

nance committee of the senate passes 
from the east to the west. The terms

As the farm “bloc” comes to power 
the chairmanship passes to the west, 
as Senator McCumber, of North Da- 
kota, will be elected to that place, 
followingg the rule of seniority in 
succession. 

The agricultural bloc will make a

does not enter, will be. filled by the 
senate committee on committees.

rapidly getting away from cotton and 
are turning to hogs, poultry and dairy- 
ing. 

Cream will be shipped from Davis- 
boro bi-weekly to the creamery at 
Rome. The first shipment went for- 
ward December 27. ‘There were not 
enough cans to contain the cream 
that was brought in and the ship- 
ments will be increased by the farm- 
ers.

and eggs was shipped from New Da- 
vishoro last year.

Christian Spirit 
Not at Conference 
On Arms, He Asserts 


Baltimore, January 2—Archbishop 
Curley, in his first New Year ser- 
mon at the cathedral today, ussailed 
leading international statesmen for as 
he declared their failure to apply 
Uh istian principles in the armament 
conference. 

“Aksence of Christain spirit,” he 
said, “has prevented the Washington 
conference from being a real agency 
of peace. Men come together in great 
cities like Paris and Versailles to 
shape the destinies af the peoples of 
the earth and now they have come 
to Washington to limit armaments 
and to bring about peace. ~* 

“Children are dying in the Near 
East. Soldiers are perishing in battle 
and men will continue to die thus for 
the peace of the world is dependent 
on the ideals of Jesus, the holiest 


of men, and not on the men who 
gather in chancellories.”

FRENCH AND JAP PACT 
CHARGE TO BE PUSHED 


Continued from First Page.

of the technical details remaining to 
be settled in connection with the naval 
limitation agreement. It was sai 
their deliberations were at such a 
stage that all the loose ends of the 
settlement probably could be -cleared 
away within a few days. If questions 


of policy raised by the submarine reg-| 


ulation proposals can be settled in 
time, the conference leaders believe 
the five-power treaty for naval limi- 
tation can be put into definite form 
during the present week. 

Tomorrow the naval experts will con- 
tinue their work, and the subcommit- 


tee appointed to formulate a new tariff 
program for China also will hold a 


meeting. Various other naval and 


Far Eastern questions will occupy the 
attention of the other delegates in in- 


formal conferences. 
Puzzling Question. 
The question of proposed restric- 


tions on submarine wartare is regarded 


by all the delegations as the most trou- 
blesome of the naval problems remain- 
ing unsolved. The first of the Root 
submarine resolutions, reaffirming ad- 
herence to. the existing principles of 
international law, has already been ac- 
cepted by the five powers; but the sec- 


ond and third, proposing still more 


stringent restrictions on the use of 
underwater’ craft, 
much controversy. 

Under the second resolution, the 
five powers would join in an agree- 
ment that, in any future war among 
them, submarievs would not be used in 
any circumstances as commerce de- 
stroyers, The United States and Great 
Britain alone have acceded to this 
proposition, Japan and Italy have 
adopted a noncommittal attitude to- 
ward it,and the French haves hown 
soine inclination, at least, to propose 
modifications before they can favor 
adoption. 

As the resolution first was present- 
ed by Elihu Root, of the American 
delegation, it merely would have pro- 
posed that the prohibition against 
submarine attacks on merchant ship- 
ping be suggested by the powérs asa 
modification of international law 
which all nations would have to ac- 
cept beforeit became effective, At 
the instance of Arthur J. Balfour, of 
the British group, however, a pro- 
vision was inserted making the pro- 
hibition immediate as between the 
United States, Gréat Britain, France, 
Japan and Italy. In it: original form 
the French indicated the proposal 
would be acceptable to their govern- 
ment, but they said tonight that they 
had received no, instructions from 
Paris regarding the resolution as 


amended, 
Changeq Possible. 


_ The delay is taken as strengthen- 
ing the possibility that France may 
have q rm ves or further changes 
to suggest before she gives assent. 
Among some of the French there is a 
feeling that merchant ships should 
not be permitted to arm if they are 
to be free from submarine attack. On 
other quarters it will be proposed that 
some restrictions should also be placed 
upon the disguising of war vessels to 
make them look like innocent mer- 
chantmen. 

_ The third Root resolution, also 
vigeonholed while the foreign dele- 
xations wait for instructions, .would 
make subject to trial as a pirate any 
submarine commander who violates 
international law. Acceptance of this 
proposal is r ed as hinging in 
some degree on the final. action taken 
regarcing the second resolution, but 
it is hoped that both may be disposed 
of before the end of the week so that 
the substance of the decisions reached 
can be embodied in the naval limita- 
tion treaty. 


are leading. tv 


tion, declared that additional docu- 
ments, which he said had passeil be- 
tween the French and Japanese dele- 
gates on the subject of a protectorate 
over Siberia, were in the files of his 


' government and that permission would 


be given for the inspection of these 
papers, as well as the originals of 
those made public last night, by a 
duly accredited representative of the 
American government. 

Cabled to Tokio. 

The Japanese delegate, M. Hani- 
hara, vice minister of foreign affairs, 
stood on his denial of last night that 
there was hot a vestige of truth in 
the documents so far as they referred 
to Japan. It is understood, however, 
that the text of the documents, as 
made public, were cabled to ‘Tokio, to- 
gether with the dez:al issued by Mr. 
Hanibara. The Japanése said today 
they would probably seek an early op- 
portunity to restate this denial for- 
mally in a letter.to Mr. Hughes. 

M. Sarraut, after a member of the 
French delegation last night had char- 
acterized the alleged notes as “forger- 
ies, stupidly contrived,” cabled a re- 
port on their publication in this coun- 
try to his government in Paris. In 
his letter today he said that since the 
powers decided upon military interven- 
tion in Siberia. no agreement has been 
concluded nor negotiated by France 
with any other power touching the 
status of the fate of Siberia. 

The letter was presented to Secre- 
tary Hughes by Ambassador Jusser- 
and, who supplemented it with some 
further observations of the same -tenor. 

The text follows: 

Text of Letter. 


“This morning’s newspapers repro- 


duce the text of pretended orticial doc- 


umei.ts communicated by a so-cailed | 


delegation of a so-ailed. government of 
Chita, which purport to emanate 
from French official authorities and, 
according to which official conversa- 
tions and records have been exchanged 
between France and other govern- 
ments for the realization of a fixed 
policy in Siberia. 

“I have the duty to make known to 
you that the published documents are 
a crude fabricat.on and that since the 
moment when the allied powers, in 
-aceord with the United States, agreed 
upon a policy of military intervention 


in Siberia direeted solely azainst, Ger- 


many and not with the purpose of 1n- 
tervening in thé interior policy of the 
Russian people, no agreement has 
been concluded nor negotiated by 
France with any other power touching 
the status or the fate of Siberia. 

“At the same time that it appears 
to me necessary to deny formally these 
false reports, I have the duty of 
bringing to your attention’ that 
the illegal and malicious effect exer- 
cised by representatives without man- 
date and without moral authority of 
the pretended republic of Chita with 
the purpose of oreating suspicions 
among the powers represented at the 
the conference of Washington, ap- 
pears, therefore, directly contrary to 
the aims of peace pursued by the con- 
ference.” p 
Suggests Inspection. 

Mr. Skvirsky, in connection with 
his proposal for inspection of the pa- 
pers, suggested that the American con- 
sul general to Kobe, Jackson A. Cald- 
well, who is temporarily stationed at 
Chita, be authorized to inspect the doc- 
uments and report on them.

Semenoff, with arms and money, and 
he was later taken up by Japan.

by Gendral Tachibana, commander-

Stevenson Decides 


Everybody Knows 
All About Gadsden 


Midshipman Carey Worth Steven- 
son, of the United States Naval acad- 
emy, Annapolis, Md., thought he and 
his home town, Gadsden, Ala., were 
both exceedingly well known and fa- 
mous for a few minutes while he was 
in Atlanta Monday. He came to At- 
lanta from Gadsden to visit a brother. 
He had telegraphed te the Southern 
railway agent here for a berth ow the 
Birmingham special from Atlanta to 
ie went out to the 
Breokwood station to catch his train, 
and‘ approached the ticket agent. 

“Have you a reservation here for 
Stevenson, in lower 6, car X SY?’ he 
asked the agent. 

“Let's see, car X 89,’ replied the 
agent, “Gadsden?’ 

“Yes, Gadsden,’ replied Stevenson, 
of Gadsden. 

“Yes, I have it,” said the agent, 
handing out the ticket. 

-The midshipman then went to the 
gate of. the station. The gateman 
asked him his destination. 

“Washington, car X S9,” said the 


“Gadsden?” asked the 
nonchalantly. 

“That's right,”’ said the midship- 
man. 

He then began to do some wondering. 
It seemed as every station attache 
knew something about “Gadsden.” He 
handed his grip to a station porter. 

“Car X 89,” he said to the porter. 

“Oh, yep, Gadsden,’ the negro re- 
plied. \ 

The midshipman turned to his 
brother. * 

“Everybody seems to know I’m from 
Gadsden aroand here,” he muttered. 

The train pulléd in. * He looked for 
the uumerals on the car. He saw 
“X 89,” written on one end of a car. 
He gave his grip to the Pullman porter, 

“Gadsden?” the porter asked sim- 


gateman, 


y. 

The middie gasped in amazement. 
He was beginning to swell with pride 
when he happened to look at the side 
of the Pullman car. 

There, painted with all the finish $f 
a Pullman artist, on the side of the 
Pullman car, was the magic word, 
“Gadsden.” 


‘BUSINESS DEPENDS 


ON RETAIL PRICES, 
SAYS HENRY FORD 


Iron Mountain, Mich., January 2.— 
Industrial conditions during the new.

the trend of retail prices, Henry Ford, '

Ford said, 


“Existing costs,” Mr.

duced, business wil] boom.”

and a forward pass, but failed to 
gain, and on the next play, an at- 
tempted. forward pass. the Presidents 
took the ball on their 35-yard line. A 
fumble I@st ground for W. & J., and

The Presidents held bucks by 
Toomey and Nichols, and Nisbet punt-

Second Period. 

The players were covered with mud 
when the second period opened, and 
the field was so slippery that runners 
had a hard time keeping their feet, 
and punters experienced difficulty in 
setting their boots away. ‘The Pres- 
idents opened play by punting. Nich- 
ols returned the punt, sending the ball 
50 yards to W. & J.’s 20-yard line. 
Stein and Erickson were able to make 
only eight yards on three plunges, 
so Brenkert punted. California again 
returned the kick. 

The undefeated Californians  ap- 
peared bewildered at the stonewall de- 
fense of the Presidents. 
ler, California’s star end, who did not 


start the game, went in during the sec- | 


ond period, after an exchange of punts, 
and on his first attempt at an end run 
was stopped by five W. & J. tacklers. 
Both teams resorted to punting almost 
exclusively. The Bears, toward the 
end of the period, found a weak spot 
in the Presidents’ right end, and with 
Toomey carrying the ball, made their 
first down on W. & J.’s 22-yard line 
just before the half ended. 
Third Period. 

Nisbet kicked off to W. & J.’s 18- 
yard line, and Basista and Erickson 
were unable to gala more than five 


_ yards on‘ bucks, so Brenkert punted. 


Both teams fumbled and California 
gained the ball on the Presidents’ J7- 
yard line. The Bears then tried more 
line plays, Toomey making three yards 
through left guard and Nichols eight 
around end, but on the next play 
‘Toomey fumbled and Kopf recovered. 

The Bears’ defense stiffened, two 
W. & J. bugks were stopped and Bren- 
kert punted to Erb, who was downed 


gon the California 37-yard line. Cali- 


fornia was off side, however, and the 
ball went back to W. & J.’s 40-yard 
line. Basista and Wes bucked ten 
yards for W. & J.’s first downs, but 
Brenkert fumbled and Cranmer re- 
covered on California’s 35-yard line.

by Guy, Jockey Lang up, a. six

Much speculation in regard to Dis-

had been given. 

Prior to the closing of last win-

attorney instituted suits against all 
the bookmakers operating at the fair

pending. At the time the bookmakers 
secured an injunction against the dis-

BATTLE OFF 


Milwaukee, Wis., January 095, 
Benny Leonard, lightweight champion 
boxer, will meet Pinkey Mitchell, Mil- 
waukee, on Monday night, January 9, 
in a 10-round no-decision bout instead 
of this afternoon as originally ar- 
ranged, the postponement being occa-

the formality of weighing in this fore- 
noon, tipping the beam at 137 1-3 
pounds. 

Mitchell is suffering from an attack 
which physicians term myositis, which 
is an inflammation of the muscles. 
The trouble affects his left shoulder 
and is said to paralyze control of 
the arm.

HANSEN HOT 
AFTER ZIBBY 


Nashville, Ten., January 2.— 
(Special.)\—*We challenge Zbyszko,

out of three to finish no draw, have 
certified check $1,000 with 
World-Herald newspaper as appear- |

are entitled to this match, for Zbysz- 
ko has thrown all the other stars, 
and he could not throw Hansen. J. 
W. Elwood, manager of Charley Hap- 
sen, Omaha, Neb.” 

The challenge above, issued by 
Charley Hansen for a return match 
with World's Champion Zbyszko, is 
plain spoken and tells, in no untertain 
terms, the wishes of the local favorite 
in the matter of a return match, 

Hansen is confident that he can gain 
the championship of the world. When 
the first match was called at midnight 
in the Chalmers ring. after the men 


had wrestled an even three hours with- d 


out a fall, Zbyszko was challenegd to a 
return match. His manager, J. H. 
Herman, of Chicago, accepted a date 
for January 9. The same night he 
changed the date to Jannary 13. Since 
that time no reply has been received 
to repeated letters sent to Zbyszko 
and his manager. They appear to be 
in no hurry to meet Hansen, if at all. 
Anxious in West. 

Papers in the west have made much 
of Hansen’s feat in holding the great 
old man of the mat to a draw. It is 
regarded all over the country as a 
most unusual ocurrence in wrestling 
circles. The attention of wrestlers 
and promoters, attracted by the Asso- 


interest in Hansen. 
maha promoters are after the match. 
Other cities are also understood to be 
making bids. Nashville should have 
the bout. inasmuch as the first match 
was staged here, and would attract 
as wide interest in this city as any 
place of anywhere near its size in the 
United States. 
The next move is up to Zbyszko.

‘PROFESSIONAL GAME 

HAS OUTLIVED USEFULNESS. 

| It simply seems to me that profes- 
‘sional basebal] has outlived its useful- 
ness as a sporting attraction. Baseball 
Lis a splendid. game—ho one could dis- 


pute that assertion successfully. Its 
basic merit will always make it the 
great pastime of the American boys. 
But under its present control, pro- 
fessional baseball has ceased to have 
even the remotest resemblance to a 
sport. dt has become a financial en- 
terprise pure and simple, although the 
financial methods of the enterprise 
are debatably pure and certainly not 
simple. 

Before this condition was brought 
about, when club owners ran their 
team for the glory of their home town, 
when they inoculated this spirit in 
their players, there would be just one 
topic of conversation in sporting cir- 
cles at this time ofthe year, and that 
topic would be the makeup of the 
home team for the approaching cam- 
paign. . 

I keep in reasonable contact with 
men who enjoy sports in Atlanta. 
Since the close of the baseball season 
t have not heard the question asked 
once, “What will the ball team be 
like next year?” 

The answer is that the people don’t 
care. 

All ‘of us can remember when the 
signing of a crack ball player would 
send, an electric thrill over the entire 
city. I believe that Babe Kuth could 
be signed for the Crackers tomorrow, 
and no one would get any kick out of 
the fact with the exception of the 
owners, Doc Auten, and Gay Butler. 


BOUND TO LOSE 
LOTS OF MONEY. 


For that reason I have stated that | 
believe that the introduction of 


astrous. Captain Meikleham is a good 
sportsman. I'd hate to see him lose 
money, but as far as objecting to the 
installation of a second elub here, if 
they want to try the venture, we'll 
welcome them and do whatever we 
can to make the venture a, blazing suc- 
cess, but at the same time we'd like 
to drop a gentle hint of warning.

A REAL 
FALLACY. 

In the first place the idea that the 
athlete puts a school on the map is 
one of the latest fallacies due to the 
reign of propaganda and press agentry 
that has spread into every line of 
business and into every protession. It 
is quite true that ¢ winning team gets 
a lot of publicity fer any school— 
temporarily. It is more true that such 
publicity is not always healthy, and 
in the majority of cases not at all de- 
sirable. If this a. Viney ate studied 
the elements of phySics he would know 


less a football team, a track team or 
any other team holds up year after 
year and shows its caliber,.the suspi- 
cion always obtains that it wag a 
built-up team, and the reaction: hurts. 

Even a steady winner is liable to 
react on a small college, and one los- 
ing game a season is usually suffi- 
cient to start that reaction. As to 
ideals, the ideals of colleges are upheld 
more by the professors than by the 
student body. In fact, without such 
high standards the morals of a stu- 
dent body would drop to nothingness, 
vor worse, in a short time. Without 
the high ideals of professors and of 
student leaders, who learn their sports- 
manship from the faculty members and 
from old grads who have gone through 
the callow days and learned what true 
sportsmanship is, almost any body of 
undergrads would become muckerish 
and rotten sportsmen, If you do not 
believe it, look over any freshman 
class, study its morals and ideals in 
sport, and see that same bunch when 
it is graduated and has learned the 
value of manhood and sportsmanship.

ours, and, after all, isn’t it the athletes that put them on the map?” 


much mistaken ideas, or that much 


ignorance, crowded into so few words. 


Take them at random: * Angell, presi- 
dent of Yale, was an athlete, and was 
and is interested in sport. With his 
dean, Harry Pratt Judson, afterward 
president of the University of Chicago, 
and A. A. Stagg, who by the way is 
a full professor and a member of the 
J. of C. faculty, he was largely re- 
sponsible for the high tone of athletics 
not only at Chicago, but through the 
entire cdnference. Dr. ‘Thompson, 
head of the Ohio State university, is 
one of the keenest of sportsmen and 
possesses am deep knowledge of the 
game. At West Point, General Doug- 
Plas MacArthur, in spite of the high 
rank and his wonderful war record, 
is one of the keenest of sportsmen, an 
authority on football and baseball; 
and if he were not commandant he 
probably would like to try for the 
team. Majors, Hayes and Daly, of 
course, rank high. Dr. James, who 
was president of Illinois. was a great 
lover of sport and an authority. Few 
suspect it, but John Greer Hibben, 
president of Princeton, was a corking 
baseball player, and he still is a lover 
of the game, and Princeton's dean is 
one of the authorities on sport in 
America, while the championship crew 
was turned out for the Tigers by a 
professor of English, who coached the 
crews when not teaching. 


FACULTY KNOW AND 
LIKE SPORTS. ; 
In the average American university, 
I would imagine that more than one- 
third of the faculty have indulged in 
athletics sports and many have been 
stars. I remember, back in the dim 
dark ages, the toughest game our foot- 
ball team had was the annual contest 
with the faculty, which lIaid aside 
s and les 


will do away with crowds in front*of 
the boxes. After fhe. game is over 
for’ entrance 
purposes during the past séason will 
be swung open as exits. 


Additional Room. 

This lot is 101 by 155 feet. Tennis 
courts may be placed’ on the lot 
tho@gh no provisions have been made. 

Temporary tiers of seats will be 
erected behind home plate during the 
coming spring for the baseball sea- 
son. ‘These will be removed to the 
opposite side of the field frcm_ the 
concrete grandstand during the 1922 
football season. A larger number of 
seats will be needed when Vanderbilt 
plays here next fall. 

Very early this 
Shields-Watkins athletic field with 
the exception of the infield of the 
baseball. diamond, will be planted in 
grass. 

A barbed-wire fence will encircle 
the field this spring during baseball 
games. and the present fence around 
the gridiron will be: removed. 

Very Large Affair. 

Right field has »een extended some 
100 feet since last baséball season and 
is being graded now. Hence the Ten- 
nessee diamond will be one of the 
largest in qgouthern collegiate circles. 

Grading is now in progress between 
the track and railroad, which will of- 
fer plenty of space for tennis courts. 
During the past summer and part of 
the fall tennis courts on Wait field 
proved exceedingly popular but these 
have disappeared since the military 
department took over the field as a 
drill ground. P 

The cinder track will be put in con- 
dition immediately so Tennessee ath- 


spring all of 


a | 
class © team in Atlanta would be dis-_ 


letes can start training for the track 
meets of the coming spring. Several 
carloads of cinders will be placed on 
the path. It will be revamped again 
before any meets are held here. 

Athletic authorities are looking to- 
wards a banner year in football here 
in 192 


JOHNNY BUFF LEAVES 
SOON FOR ENGLAND 


New York: January 2.—Johnny 
Buff, holder of the American flyweigtt 
and the world’s bantamweight cham- 
pionships. will sail for England on 
January 15 for a visit of 16 weeks. 
He will be accompanied by his_man- 
ager, Lou Diamond, and Jabez White, 
bantamweight. 

Buff has not been signed for any 
bouts, going abroad to fulfill a theatri- 
cal contract, but Manager Diamond 
said that he expected the veteran 
Jersey boxer would be called upon to 
defend his world bantamweight title 
hefore he returned. 


James A. Burns, C. S. C., who is now 
president of Notre Dame university. 
‘He was outfielder and catcher for 
| Notre Dame in his school days, and 
i'n member of the football squad, a 
‘runner and all-round athlete, and in 
i spite of his high office he stil] has 
‘time to take an advisory part in ath- 
| leties and an active interest in the 
' teams, 

The faculty of almost any school 
| probably can show more expert knowl- 
‘edge of sports and games and more 
experience than the student body can 
produce. 

THE CHEWING 

CHAMPIONS. ; 

One of the best high school football 
teams in the United States these last 
‘two seasons was that of Port Ches- 
ter, N. Y¥., which won the Westches- 
ter championship and which was fig- 
ured stronger than almost any high 
school team in the east. It had one 
peculiarity, which may or may not 
have affected it; and it can claim the 
tobacco chewing football championship 
of the world. Either from tradition 
or to bring luck, every kid playing ‘in 
the line chewed tobacco, and in spite 
of the fact that the coach was Carle- 
ton Coffin, from Springfield Y. M. 
C. A. college. 

Just how the linesmen came to 
chew is a mystery, but it is reported 
that it.came from Climax Bain, the 
leader, who declared that his work de- 
pended upon his chewing tobacco, and 
that if he lost his quid or his plug 
he could not charge or tackle. ‘The 
others took it up, and the line was 
named for different brands of chew- 
ing. This line was composed of Star 
Steilman, Battle Ax Buckley, Fine 
Cut English, Horseshoe Houck, Cli- 
max Bain, Ivanhoe Weissing and Jol- 
ly Tar Faneri—and it was decided 
that when they starting spouting noth- 
ing could stop them. 

During one game with Mamaroneck, 
Bain suddenly stopped the game, ran 
to the side lines, dug out his chewing 
tobaceg, and came hack with a plunge 
that gained fifteen yards. 

The kids in the backfield couldn’t 
quite take the heroic dose, but it is 
vowed that-Jack Buckley, who is Bat- 
tle Axe’s kid brother, tried it, swal- 
lowed the chew on his first end run, 
and had to be taken out for one period, 

It is ‘strong medicine, and not ad- 
vised for other teams, but the Port

They presented a defense that was 
well-nigh impregnable, while on the 
offense they uncovered a_ series of 
tricky and versatile attacks that put 
the Centre men completely at sea. En-

NO VETERANS 
FOR L. DOYLE 


Nashville, Tenn., January 2.— 
(Special.)—One thing is a certainty 


in a baseball way. The Dell next 


flock of worn-out ball players, whose 
careers on the diamond have long 
since waned. Little Kock may have 
its Gabby Streets, Atlanta its Roy 
Ellams, and all the rest of it, but 
the expressed desire of Larry Doyle is 
to get a club on the field that can 
play ball, and not occupy its time by 
playing hookey from the old men’s 
ome. 

This was clearly indicated when he 
turned down an offer to land Outfield- 
er Riley, a veteran slipping from Class 
AA ball. Word came to Voll headquar- 


telegram was sent to Doyle. Larry 
replied that there was noting doing. 
He wants ball players able ¢0 get in 
the game and stay there, preferring 
those who aspire to higher realms, 


ness are over. 
In his telegram, Manager Doyle also 


pair of outfielders. He expressed .no 
ideas as to who they were or where 
they played last year, but it is thought 
that one of them was a .300 hitter in 
the Southern.. Probably he will fig- 
ure in a trade or cash consideration 
for the Vols. At any rate, the fans 
will be glad to know that Larry picks

KREWSEN IS 
W.R. CAPTAIN 


” 


Cleveland, Ohio, January (Spe- 
cial.) —Albert Krewsen, ard, was 
elected captain of the 1922 Western 
Reserve football team, winning out in 
the race for that honor over Ertle 
and Wahl. ; 

Krewsen is a Cleveland boy, having 
prepped at West Tech High school. 
He is a student in the Reserve Dental 
college and bas played on the team 
for two years. Krewsen played a good 
game on the Reserve line last season 
and is expected to show’ to better ad- 
gantage next fall. 

Another Dentist. - 


Reserve gridders makes the second 
eonsecutive year that a dental student 
has been captain of the eleven. Buddy 
Cathcart, pilot of the 1921 squad, also 
studying for that profession. 

Fifteen players were awarded foot- 
bail Rs by the Reserve athletic com- 
mittee: Captain Cathcart, Balogh, 
Fulton, Kurtz. Gordon, Krewsen, 
Ertle, Wahl, Ruedy, Jones, Kurt 
Smith, Wolfe. Geraci, Jack Davis and 
Holland Davis and also Manager 
Arthur Smith. y 

On counting the votes it was de- 
termined that Jim Marek has. been 
elected captain of the 1922 Reserve 
baseball team by acclamation. Marek 
has played shortstop and pitcher on 
the Reserve nine for the last two 
years. He also won two football 
letters. 

Baseball prospects are exceedingly 
bright at Resetve and it is believed 
that Marek will lead the strongest 
nine Reserve has had in several sea- 
sons. Practically all of last year’s 
varsity and the strong freshman team 
are eligible to play next spring.

Declaring that the year 1921 has 
been a period of gratifying civic 
progres sin all lines of municipal en- 
deavor, Mayor Key Monday night 
read to the incoming council of 1922 
his annual message formally review- 
mg the activities of his office for the 
past year. 

The mayor declared that the most 
constructive forward steps the city 
bas taken in many years were the 
increase of taxes from $1.25 to $1.50 
for the benefit of the publie schools 
and the overwhelming victory of the 
$8,550,000 for extensive municipal 
improvements. : 

The mayor defended the local po- 
lice, department, declaring that it has 
been seriously handicapped by the 
fact that no increase to the strength 
of the department has been made dur- 
ing several years which witnessed a’ 
phenomenal growth on the, part of 
the population entitled to police pro- 
tection.

the mayor praised the signal system

in Message 


work of the city government for a 
new year, we could w recount 
with interest and profit, the Prog 
ress which has been made by the 
city, in the line of municipal effort, 
during the three years I have had 
the pleasure __ honor of serving 
with you. I w not trespass upon 
your time and patience, however, 
in doing so. A survey of the situa- 
tion, however, will disclose that 
during those three years greater 
progress has been made by the city 
in almost every line than has be 
made during any é@imilar period of 
time in the city’s history. 

“The most distinctive advance, so 
far as placing the city in the line of 
progress, Was made during the year 
1921, when by a vote of the people 
their tax rate was increased from 
$1.22 to $1.50, and by an overwhel- 
ming vote of the people a bond is- 
Sue of $8,500,000 was eer ie’ 
and which is now about to be {is- 
sued and sold. The increase in tax 
rate, so-called, was not, in fact, an 
increase at all. It was a restora- 
tion of the rate which prevailed for 
many years. This rate was reduced : 
during a panic period to meet a 
temporary situation, and was al- 


‘lowed to remain go reduced after 


that situation had been relieved. 
Rate Too Low. 


There have been no students of 
municipal affairs, with but few ex- 
ceptions, that have not believed 
that during those years the tax 
rate of this city was too low. It 
did not enable it to funcfion prop- 
erly and sufficiently. The actual 
municipal needs had not beén met, 
and could not be met, on that basis 
of revenue. The result was that 
the city wast completely falling 
down in its obligations to the pub- 
lic, and with no hope of fulfilling 
them. With the present rate, the 
city will be able to function, not in 
any extravagant “manner, but to 
meet the. absolute necessities of 
the case. It is true that this in- 
crease of revenue has all gone to 
the school department, but if the 
needs of the schoo] départment had 
not beeh met in that way, it would 
bave been necessary to cut all of 
the city’s activities down in order 
to meet the needs of the schools in 
part. The results would have been 
that all of the departments would 
necessarily have suffered. 

“One of the serious errors into 
which the city has fallen has been 
on the question of the tax rate, If 
the present rate were increased and 
the assessments of property re- 
duced correspondingly, s0 as to 
produce exactly the same amount 
of revenue as is now received, it 
would save a great deal of money 
to the people of this community 
which is now being unjustly exact- 
ed from them. I submit that mat- 
ter for consideration of those who 
wish to place our city’s affairs on 
@ permanent and correst basis. 


The Bond Issue. 

“The bond issue voted by the 
eople of Atlanta was the largest 
ssue of bonds ever voted by any 
city south of Baltimore. The ex- 
penditure comes at a time when it 
can be of the greatest possible ben- 
efit to our people. Before this 
bond issue was ever voted there 
was a widespread demand that a 
bond commission should be .ap- 
pointed to supervise and ércom- 
mend as to its expenditure. This 
commission was appointed in ad- 
vance of the election. The com- 
mission and its personnel was pass- 
ed upon by the voters. It had their 
approval. The city government is 
pledged to give them evory fair- 
and reasonable suppott. The bond 
commission in its recommendations 
is pledged to the public to give 
them the —— and fullest sub- 
stantial benefits that their money 
will buy. None of this money shall 
be wasted in experiments nor pass- 
ed out as favors. The money shall 
be spent In the most skillful and 
economic manner er ae Tt Shall 
be spent as rapidly’ as good judg- 
ment and good business witl dic- 
tate, but not otherwise. It shall 
be epent locally, where there can 
be procured in service or materials 
as good locally as elsewhere. Ex- 
penditures shall be directed by the 
best skill and ability. That will 
guard against extravagance, waste 
and loss, and will mean more in 
work and more in results than if a 
mistake was made on this oint. 
"In the expenditure of so large & 
sum of money, difficulties will be 
experienced in withstanding the im- 
portunities of those who have some- 
thing to sell. This can be met 
only by a scrupulous care and 
scrupulous fidelity to the ad 
which has been resposed by the pub- 


ic. 
- “Attacks ag nol - 
‘During the year past the police 
deunrcmant of the city has been 
much in the public eye and has been 
subjected to much inveatigation ana 
discussion. The work of the de- 
partment, its personnel and the re- 
sults obtained have been subjected 
to more or less criticism. In pass- 
ing -fairly on this question there 
are two outstanding facts which 
must be considered. One is that as 
a result of after-war conditions 
there has been evident throughout 
the whole country a letting down in 
moral standards. There has not 
been that respect for law among 
the general public that we have en- 
ijoyed at other times. As to the dit- 
ferent elements that enter into this 
I will not discuss, but that situation 
is recognized by all. Another large 
factor is the immense amount of une 
employment throughout he country. 
It is estimated recently by the 
United States government authori- 
ties that there were four and a half 
million people out of employmen’ 
who depended on their work for @ 
living. Thé unemployment situa- 
tion unquestionably is not as 5é- 
vere with us as in some other lo- 
calities, but it is severe enough, 
and it has doubtless made the police 
problem more otteent* than it other- 
rise ould have been. 
"Se eee large factor which has 
affected the police department is 
that there has been no substantial 
increase in this department for many 
vears. In fact, the demands upon 
the department for traffic condl- 
tions and the increase in overhead 
duties of the department, leaves the 
police with less men to do actua 
police work than they had ten years 
ago. During that period our pop-~- 
ulation has incresed 531-3 per cent, 
and we havé been expecting too 
much from the police departmént 
considering the support which hase 
been given them. 

Says Criticism Harmful. 


“The police department has had 
to carry on ite work in the face of 
not only what is known as a “crime 
wave,” but has had to carry it_on 
in the face of a criticism wave. The 
department and its work has repeat- 
edly ‘been held up to scorn by. the 
morning newspaper of our city. The 
effect of this has been to discour- 
age, more or less, the men in the 
department to handicap them in 
their work, and to invite within 
from everywhere, on the theory 
our borders crooks and ctiminals 
that they would be enabled to carry 
on their work without let or hin- 
derance. It is a queer sort of patri- 
otism that would permit any re- 
spectable concern to carry on & war- 
fare like this against its own city 
and its own people. Constructive, 
helpful criticism should be and al- 
ways is invited, but destructive crit- 
iciem and antagonism is as vicious 
and harmfw) as the criminal activi- 
ties themselves. It is a pity that 
we have not a remedy simple 
enough to suppress stich an Institu- 
tion of this kind. In the absence of 
such power, it isi only possible to 
pointiout and lea fair and just 
publid deal with i

and the unusual) narrowness of our 
streets. There can be no real so- 
lution of the traffic conditions un- 
til we have more general traffic 
thoroughfares. ring street is 
now open from rietta to Norta 
avenue, which piu 

siderabie relief. We are advised 
that duing the year it will be open- 
ed from North avenue to Peachtree 
road, which will afford additional 
relief. During the year also tht 
Spring Street viaduct should be 
built. This will afford a tremen- 
dous amount of relief, and with 
Madison Avenue open as a thorough- 
fare into Forsyth or Whitehall 


cross-town thoroughfare. That fuls 
development should be a part of the 
plan of the city, adopted now, and 
worked out as rapidly as possible. 

“We must have other cross-town 
thoroughfares upon which traffic 
can and will move rapidly. There 
aré two streets which are now con- 
tending for improvement in this re- 
spect: Courtland street and Pied- 
mond avenue. Each one has its dis- 
tinct advantages. Weither has all 
ot the advantages, and in the 
course of time both will have to 
be adopted as cross-town thorough- 
fares. It is scarcely possible to do 
more than accompligh one of them 
at this time. The planning .com- 
mission has recommended Piedmont 
avenue. The whole question, how- 
ever, is open for the general coun- 
cil and it should put the weight 
of its influence promptly behind 
one or the other. The work, guch 
as is contemplated for a cross-town 
thoroughfare, can not be done with- 
out the support of the county com- 
Thissioners. I feel that it is a mat- 
ter of public duty that they should 
get behind one of these thorough- 
fares promptly in the beginning of 
this year and that it be carried 
out agey to -completion. The 
amount of money which is paid by 
the taxpayers of the city amply 
justify this position, and I recom- 
mend that your proper committee 
confer with the county commission- 
ers as early as possible on this sub- 
ject. 

Praises Signal System. 

“In the meantime there are many 
things Jocally that can be done that 
will aid traffic. The signal sys- 
tem at Five Points has been of im- 
mense benefit. Marking out of pe- 
destrian lines on the streets has 
also been of much benefit. I cheer- 
fully give the credit for these sug- 
gestions to Chiefe Beavers, of the 
een department, and also ac- 

nowledge the help of City Dlectri- 
Cian Turner in working out the 
signal system. There are @& num- 
ber of other points in the city 
where traffic can be aided by the 
extension of this signal system, and 
I recommend that this system be 
extended to such points as it will 
be found workable. 

“T agestime that there will be pre- 
sented to.the general council during 
the early part of the year plans for 
the general wrevision of the city 
charter, giving more or less sub- 
etantial changes in the form of 
city government. There is an In- 
sistent and intelligent demand from 
a great many people that the city 
government should be made more 
direct and more responsive. This 
can be done, and should be done. 
The government, however, should 
be, In my opinion, a representative 
government. 

“Efforts have been made from 
time to time to change the city’s 
charter. These movements usually 
are revolutionary in character. 
When the movement was started 
naturally it would enlist in its 
ranks those who had a desire to 
take charge of the movement in 
order to capture the city govern- 
ment. This effort to capture the 
city government usually resulted in 
the defeat of the issue, as it should 
have done. My own ‘opinion is that 
the movement should be evolution- 
ary ingtead of revolutionary. The 
improvements which we would seek 
should be evolved from our own 
local experience. From that advan- 
tage should be taken of what has 
proven to be good, and added to the 
other things that we are justified 
in concluding would be an improve- 
ment. If the work of improving 
the charter should be taken up in 
utter disregard of polifical ques- 
tions, without any political ends to 
be met, I am sure much good could 
be accomplished along those lines. 
Public Market.’ . 


“YT have had occasion to discuss 
the matter of a public market for 
the city several times during the 
year, and there scarcely remains 
anything to be added to that. I 
have found that there are very 
strong, powerful influence in this 
city ‘which oppoSe the pt. ic mar- 
ket. There is, of course, honest dif- 
Page of opinion among men on 
@ subject of a public market. 
Those who are openly fighting the 
market have advertised that they 
are spénding time, effort and money 
in defeating the market. In just 
what ways they are spending their 
time, effort and money, I am not 
fully advised. I feel sure that the 
money they are spending they are 
taking from the people-th the way 
of profits which need would lose if 
we had a public market. The public, 
indirectly, is required to finance the 
opposition to this movement. 
“There never was a time in the 
history of this city and state when 
the matter of development and sup- 
port of the market idea was as im- 
portant as now. The whole coun- 
try is undergoing a change. Busi- 
ness and economic onditions 
around through the territory of the 
state is much wore than it is in our 


city. 

“hless those conditions improve, 
it is going to be felt here, and felt 
very deeply, and felt very sales - 
This city could not justify itself Jn 
taking any position which did not 
enlarge the production of commod- 
ities and aid in the sale of commod- 
ities around through the territory 
tributary to this city. The develop- 
ment of the market idea ig one of 
the most important of all our ques- 
tions at this time. The city of At- 
lanta should establish her _ leader- 
ship in this movement, and by so 
doing can accomplish great good for 
herself in every way. We find that 
there is a certain amount of preju- 
dice always against cities, frequent- 
lv unjustified, but nevertheless they 
are hurtful. This movement can 
remove a great deal of that preju- 
dice. but if we fail in it it will in- 
tensify that prejudice. 


To Sustain Self. 


"The general council has attempt- 
ed to deal with only one-half of the 
appropriation that was necessary 
to purchase a site for the market 
during 1921. In 1922 the remain- 


When 


the site is secured it is expected 
and planned that’ the market can be 
built and twrned over to the city 
according to the same plan adopted 
for the Auditorium-Armory, and it 
is also anticipated that the market 
will be self-sustaining. Out of 
its revenue the cost of the erection 
of the market can be met. I see no 
reason why this plan cannot be 
made entirely successful, as the ex- 
pense of running the market would 
bé ve 
be made such as ‘s n-wessary to 
meet the demands upon !t for fund- 
ing the cost of the market. 

“One of the situations in which 
the city has outgrow. its methods 
and facilities is that of the sani- 
tary department. The collection 
and transportation of garbage 

mules and carts as a 

has practically brok- 

en The service cannot 
be given to the public by that meth- 
od, and the expense of it is enor- 
mous. During last year the expense 
of this department amounted to 
about $475,000. As the territory 
of the city expands, and it has re- 
cently expanded very much, the ex- 
pense and difficulty of this @epart- 
ment increases. with no hope of iff- 
creasing its efficiency. Under the 
present system, during the year the 
city los¢ forty mules, mostiy from 
overwork and overheat. This de- 
partment ought to be entirely mo- 
torized with motor trucks, and tn 
such cases as the situation requires, 
the addition of trailers, the work 
of this department would be greatly 
expedited and very larze economies 
effected. recommend that the 
Zeneral council begin immediately 
this year the motorizing of the san- 
‘tary department, that it do not un- 
dertake to accomplish all of this at

acres, about five Se from * the 
center of the city. It has a good 
road to it except the emeeiate -

With a good road at this piont, there 
would be no great @ifference in 
oint of time in going to or from

bringing the prison activities and 
the dairy activities together witli: 
enable both to be carried on more

is a very gfreat need for the use 
of the present prison property for 
other uses than prison purposes. At 
the present time a part of thé prop- 
erty is being used for a goif course, 
and within a few months it will be 
one of the prettiest and most pop- 
ular courses in the city. It is be- 
'r enjoved by many hundreds of 
eople. The prison property would 
e, in my opinion, especially adapta- 
ble for use as an opportunity or part

secure training in many different 
vocations, which they can and do 
follow in life for a livelihood. \ 
belleve that this is one of the most 
progressive steps that can be taken 
by the city government. 
Planning Recommendations. 


“There has been submitted to you, 

coming frqm the planning ‘eommis- 
sion, a complete plan for the zoning 
of the city. Upon this work the 
planning commission and its employ- 
ees have been engaged since its es- 
stablishment during last year. The 
work is very tedious and volumi- 
nous. Most of the work in its de- 
tail has been gone over by the mem- 
bers of the general council and Mr. 
Whitten, the planning expert. This 
ordinance comes from the planning 
commission simply as a recommen- 
dation to the general council. The 
planning commission has no léegisla- 
tive authority. A zone plan ie very 
essential to the city. t will pre- 
vent & vast amount of waste and 
destruction which has been goin 
on on account of the unrestricte 
and unfestrained power in each in- 
dividual to build without regard to 
the Welfare or development of the 
neighborhood. It is believed that 
this ordinance will remedy most of 
the evils along this liné from which 
we suffer. It may be and probably 
is not perfect, but I have no know]l- 
qaise of any city that has adopted 
plans like this that have not found 
them unquestionably valuable and 
practicable. I recommend the eéar- 
nest consideration of this ordinance, 
and its adoption as early as prac- 
tical] by the general council. 
“In connection with the work of 
the planning commission in the city, 
it would be very valuable if we 
could include the citits, towns and. 
communities surrounding the city 
in the general plan of development. 
In every direction which you may 
go, following the line of natural 
development, there will be in the 
future other nearby developments 
which will be injurious and hurtful 
unless prevented. An _ effective 
‘Oning plan in advance would regu- 
late such matters. A scheme of 
parks and playgrounds in connee- 
tion with it would prevent a great 
many objectionable developments 
that are hurtful to néarby territory, 
and a planning out in advance of 
boulevards, drives, streets, sewers 
and other developments would save 
a great deal in expense and waste 
in the future. In the development 
of the planning commission for the 
city, another or larger plan should 
be included. 


Public Recreation. 


“There has beeh a very rapid de- 
velopment of the idea of public re- 
creation throwgphout the country. A 
system of public recreation has been 
found to be very valuable in cities. 
A great many cities are spending 
large sums of money onit. It is the 
natural bent and universal need of 
humanity to seek recreation of one 
kind or another. If these energies 
and efforts are properly directed 
along wholesome lines, it cannot be 
otherwise than very profitable to 
the community, It would 
quire a very large appropriation to 
‘arry on the work of directing pub- 
lic recreation. We are familiar 
with a number of things that are 
being done by the city already in 
rather an unsystematic way, such 
as golf, basketball, baseball, play- 
grounds for children, amateur the- 
atricals and other things. A rea- 
sonable expendituré for the employ- 
ment of some person or persons, to 
work all of these things out and de- 
velop them in a systematic way, is 
highly recommend. 

“During the year the matter of 
paving streets on the baby bond 
plan has had full force. Nearly a 
million dollars of new pavements 
were laid under this lan last 
vear. The eagerness with which 
people took advantage of it has 
proven that it meets the needs of 
the situation. The ease with which 
the bonds have been negotiated and 
the comparatively small delay in 
completing the transactiong have 
been a gratifying success. It is 
the only plan which has ever beén 
Jevised ‘which insures the 
paving of the city. I would say 
now that under this plan this city 
pwould be practically a paved city 
within two years’ more time, There 
have been no objections to this plan 
urged, and no antagoniem to it, ex- 
cept by the street car company, 
which is now seeking to enjoin this 
operation on those streets where 
there are street car tracks. I take 
this occasion to express the “a 
that all of this opposition will be 
withdrawn so that the city may 
proceed ase rapidly as possible to 
pave all of the public streets where 
pavements are demanded. 

“During the three years passed I 
have devoted all of my time and ef- 
fort to make this city all that it 
should be. Ie feel that before: the 
ena of my term has been reached 
that a@ great many of the things 
which we should have will be either 
accomplished or on the way to ac- 
complishment. In this work I have 
invited the co-operation of all to 
join in that same purpose, and I 
fave had the pleasure of enjoying 
the assistance of a great many pub- 
lic-spirited people, and particularly 
the members of the city government. 
I desire to again thank them for 
their sympathy and co-operation, 
and ask them to continue as they 
have in the past in their effort for 
the upbuilding of our fair city. 

“Respectfully, 
“JAMES L. KPY, 
“Mayor.”.

legislator will expire when the leg-

r. McDonald stated that at the 
proper time he wilt make known his 
platform. Owing to his handicap, he 
will start an early campaign for the 
office. He is already conferring with 
his friends in wonnection with the 
contest. 

Although blind since early youth, 
Mr. McDonald, who will complete his 
third term as legislator from Rich- 
mond county this summer, will seek a 
position on the railroad commission, 
and will begin his campaign shortly. 

M. L. Johnson, member of the house 
of representatives from Bartow coun- 
ty, and one of the veteran members 
of the legislature, also announced in 
Atlanta Monday that he“has definite- 
ly decided to become a candidate for 
a place on the commission. 

C. mt ay ey Candler, present chair- 
man of the commission, stated Sun- 
day that he will not seek re-election 
when his term expires. James A. 
Perry,. another commissioner. will 
complete his term this year simulta- 
neously with Mr. Candler. 

Representative McDonald has been 
a picturesque character in the hall 
of representatives for five sessions. 
He is married and has two children. 
To the assistance and encouragement 
given him by his wife he gives much 
credit for his success as a practicing 
lawyer. 

r. McDonald lives near Augusta 
on a farm and has mn very suc- 
cessfuly as a farmer. ‘Like other 
professional. men,’’ he said Monday, 
“I make my money practicing law 
and spend it farming.” 

Mr. McDonald lost his sight at the 
age of 18 when -he was shot in a 
neighbor’s’ watermelon patch by the 
owner of the melons. . The neighbor 
was convicted. The conviction was 
appealed, and before the appeal was 
heard the defendant died. 

Aftér attending the School for the 
Rlind near Macon and the Overbrook 
School for the Blind in Philadelphia,

“Uncertainty as to the size of the 
American cotton crop has: a dis- 
turbing factor in the raw cotton and 
cotton markets during the 
month. On the 3d of October the 
government predicted « ¢rop of only 
6,537,000 bales, but since that date 
it has become evident that the produc- 
tien totals much more than that. The 
trade, however, was unprepared for 
the government’s "Jecember estimate 
of 8,340,000 bales. This is considered 
by many authorities to be an over- 
estimate. The more general opinion is 
that the outturn will be about 8,000,000 
baies. This increase: the total sup- 
| ply of cotton in the country by 1,500,-

‘adopted and advises the consideration | 


of the “Sommers system.” “We are 
of the opinion,” says ‘the report, “that 
some scientific system of assessing 
tveal estate, based upon the potential 
“usefulness of the street on which the 
land abuts, would be an improvement 
‘over the present system, barring, as it 
would the possibility of personal equa- 
tion assessments.” 

Another recommendation was that 
the evils of the present system of 
‘preparing tax digests and collecting 
the city taxes be eliminated by dis- 
earding the present system, which the 


| 


declared to be obsolete, and 
ng a more modern system. _ | 
The report also declares that much 
personal property in. possession of tax- 
payers subject to tax is not being re- 
turned, and is not being disGovered 
under the present system of investiga- 
tion, and for that reason recommends 
that the department of tax investiga- 
tor should be abolished., 
Changes Are Urged. 

“This can be done immediately,” de- 
clares the report, “by declining to re- 
elect or elect a tax investigator. In 
lieu of this office there should be two 
or three deputy tax assessors, clothed 
with necessary authority to investi- 
gate personal property of all descrip- 
tions, and completely and entirely un- 
der the supervision and control of the 
board of tax assessors.” ‘The present 
tax investigator is “Sledge” Collier. 

Relative to the recommendation that 
the force of the department of the 
city marshal be increased, the report 
declares that “there dre many peo- 
ple in the city subject to tax, both 
street and personal, that are not con- 
tributing anything toward the opera- 
tion of the city government. We owe 
it to those who do pay to collect from 
those who attempt to escape. 

“The practice, howevér, of transfer- 
ring tax fi. fas. and tax deeds to in- 
diyidual persors, wha in turn quietly 
hold them until they can exact extor- 
tionate amounts from innocent tax- 
payers is considered pernicious, and 
should be immediately abandoned or 
restrictions placed on _ the practice. 
This is not the fault of the marshal, 

ut has been done at the reuest of 
other officials.” 

The report closes by praising the 
work of City Clerk Walter Taylor.

lines also was said to be in an unsat- 
isfactory condition, but wholesale 
prices “are showing increased stabil- 
ity.” Unemployment conditions were 
reported by the board as but little 
changed. ' 

“A decided improvement in Euro- 
pean exchanges,’ the board said, “has 
tended to some extent to help the for- 
eign trade situation during the month 
of December, but the extreme caution 


i 


in the extension of bank credits, which | 
was previously notable a»phase of * 
our foreign trade still continues. Ex- | 
port figures indicate a still fusther | 
decline of activity in staples, while 
imports show an advance. 

?- Foreign Conditions. 

“Disturbed conditions in countries 
of Europe still render 4 maintenance 
of business relations with them un- 
certain and hazardous. Rates of in- 
terest which had already made a nota- | 
ble decline during the autumn have | 
tended on the whole still further down- 
ward, partly owing to the fact that 
there was no foreign outlet for our 
capital.” 

Reviewing the year in the shipping 
industry the board declared that the 
“industry has been through a most 
difficult period, in which many of the 
weaker operators have been forced out 


. 


of business and in which, as a result of 
greatly reduced freight rates, Smaller 
available cargoes, and continued high 
costs of operation, very few compa- 
nies have been able to make a satisfac- 
tory wing. This condition pas 
been world-wide, although American 
companies have felt in specfal degree 
the handicap of a higaer scale of wages 
than their foreign competitors. have 
been obliged to pay. :

The Picture Puzzle Game is an innovation- equally interesting to men, 
women and children. It is simple enough for a child to enjoy, and yet 
perplexing enough to be grippingly absorbing to the older folks. The re- 
sult is that young and old experience real enjoyment from this novel pas- 
time. The picture is just below. Don’t miss this good time. Without any 
trouble whatever you can readily see such objects as “shovel,’’ “‘sack,”’

SIMPLE RULES TO OBSERVE

not an employee of The Atlanta Constitution, 
or a member of an employee’s family, may 
submit an.answer. It costs nothing to try. 


2. All answers must be mailed by January 
21, 1922. 


3. Answers should be written on one side 
of the paper only, and each word numbered 
consectively, 1, 2, 3, etc. Do not put more than 
one “S-Word” with each number. Write your 
full name and address on each page in the 
upper right-hand corner. If you desire to 
write anything else, use a separate sheet. 


4. Only words found in the English dic- 
tionary will be counted. Do not use hyphen- 
ated, compound or-obsolete words. Use either 
the singular or plural, but where the plural is 
used, the singular*‘can not be counted and vice 
versa.

only once, even though used to designate ‘dif- 
ferent objects. The same object can be named 
only once; however, any .visible part of the 
object may also be named. 


6. The person sending in the largest and 
nearest correct list of “S-Words” will win first

be awarded to more than one of any group out- 
side of the family, where two or more have

(CHAMBER PRECEDENT 


Precedent was broken at the At-

when Walter O. Foote, senior mem- 
ber of Foote & Davies and recently 


elected president of the chamber, kept 
office hours at the chamber building 
from 11 to 2 o’clock and announced 
that he will continue to do so during 
the remainder of his term. 

“Heretofore,” he said, “presidents 
of the chamber have been subject to 
call when needed, and these calls fre- 
quently interrupted their business or 
professional duties. Under the new 
arrangement I can keep appointments 
better and generally accomplish more 
than I might under the old system.”
