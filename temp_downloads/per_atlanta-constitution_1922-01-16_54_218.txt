“ -- *row Wilson ‘today believes in the un-

former president, speaking to more 
than a thousand admirers, Sunday eve- 
ning at hig home, further declared 
that these who do not believe in the 
vitality of the league “will have to 
look out for themselves.” 

Wilson said that his only concern 
now was “to see our great people turn 
their faces in the right direction and 
move with all their force.” 

Gompers Is Spokesman. 

The former president’s remarks were 
in response to the greetings of the 
crowd who trudged two miles through 
slushy streets, following a mass meet- 
ing. in .« downtown theater at which | 
the local campaign to establish the 
Woodrow Wilson ‘foundation was 
launched. 

Samuel Gompers, president of the 
American Fefleration of Labor and a 
member of the American advisory com- 
mittee of thesarms conference, as the 
spokesman for -the crowd, told ex- 
President Wilson that the demonstra- 
tion was proof that the league of na- 
tions was not dead. 

The former president, leaning on the 
arm of Mrs. Wilson in the doorway 
of his home, addressed the gathering 
as folows: ° 

“YT need hardly tel] you how such 
a demonstration of friendship and 
confidence makes me feel,” Wilson 
said. “There can be no doubt as to 


their present program. 

City Detectives Stone and F. R. 
Fenn, of the Pinkerton operatives, left 
the city Saturday afternoon at 4:25 
o’clock for Detroit, realizing that they 
are going after a man of the most 
dangerous type and fully determined 
to take every possible precautionary 
measure prior to insure the return 
here of the “Peachtree Bandit.” 

Since report of his capture Friday 
night by Detroit authorities and sub- 
. squent: statements from DuPre, in 
which full confession was made of the 
robbery of the $2,500 diamond from 
the Nat Kaiser Jewelry store on De- 
cember 15, the fatal shooting of Irby 
©. Walker, Pinkerton detective, and 
the serioys shooting of City Comp- 
troller B. Graham West, coupled with 
a complete narrative of his sensation- 
al flight to freedom, intense interest 
has centered in and around Atlanta 
upon the return of this confessed 
criminal. 

His capture ended one of the most 
dramatic and sensational man hunts 
ever waged in the south. The reward, 
which was quickly offered for his 
arrest-, was one of the largest amounts 
ever offered in the south for a 
criminal. 

He will, upon his return, imme- 
diately be.placed in a guarded cell 
in Fulton County Tower. The exact

This statement, together with sup-

ception of the act. 

Salient points brought to light are 
as follows: 

All unmarried persons or married 
persons not living with their, wives or 
husbands with an income exceeding 
$1,000, and all married persone living 


income exceeding $2,000 should make 

returns regardless of whether they can

much trouble in years: to come when

All persons whose incomes are $5,- 
000 or more are required to niake 
returns. If a man whose income is 
$5,001 can positively show that he 
is entitled to $8,000 exemptions, it is 
still compulsory that he file his re- 
turn. 

Items entitling the person making 
his return to exemptions under the

Third Demonstration. 

The demonstration at the Wilson

been tendered the former president 
since his retirement from public life. 
The first occurred March 4, 1921, fol- 
lowing the inauguration of President 
Harding. On that occasion thousands 
flocked to Wilson’s house. The second 
demonstration occurred during the aft- 
ernoon of Armistice day, after the ex- 
president had ridden in the funeral 
procession of the unknown dead. On 
neither of these occasions did Wilson 
‘express more than his appreciation for

Agriculture Bloc Has Sub- 
stitute Plans for Proposed 
Farmer Member. 


Washington, January 15.—Agree- 
ment has been reached by leaders of 
the senate agricultural bloc on two 
substitutes designed to remove objec- 
tions by President Harding to legis- 
lation proposing a farmer representa- 
tive on the federal reserve board, 
These are expected to be presented to 
the white house so that the president 


may indicate his preference, which 
they hope will become the accepted so- 
lution of the senators supporting the 
legislation. 

e first of the two suggestions, said 
to have been adopted after a series of 
informal conferences.yesterday and to- 
day between bloc leaders, was that the 
proposed statute be changed to give 
or on the board to represent- 
atives of the several phases of nation- 
al industrial and commercial effort; 
the second would wipe out anhy spe- 
cific designation as to the make-up of 
the board, which now must include 
two members of bankipg experience 
and leave the representation to the 
authority holding the appointing 


power. 
More Talk Coming. 

There did not seem to have been a 
definite understanding among the bloc 
leaders as to whether. they would 
press their original demand that the 

rd membership be increased by one 
to take care of the farmer member, 
This plan was contained in the orig- 
inal Kellogg bill, but the Smith amend- 
ment altered it somewhat and specified 
that the farmer member should be se- 
lected to fill the first vacancy. 

Further conferences on the proposi- 
tion appeared likely tomorrow in or- 
der to get as nearly to a rock-bottom 
basis as possible before the senate con- 
venes, at which time the proposed 
legislation is slated to be taken up 
under the unanimous consent agree- 
ment entered into prior to the Christ- 
mas recess. No formal draft of either 
of the alternative propositions has 
been made, it was said tonight, but 
the leaders declared they had their 
views so well in mind that they could 
put their ideas in legislative shape at 
a moment’s notice if needed. One 
senator said there would be a show- 
down by noon tomorrow, but he would 
not indicate whether those in charge 
of .the measures expected to discuss 
the subject with Mr. Harding before 
that time. 

Either Would Do. 

It was felt that either of the pro- 
posals mentioned above would meet 
th: objections voiced by Mr. Harding 
to the original bill. The banking in- 
terests have entered strong objection 
to the explicit designation of a farmer 
and have urged that if congress de- 
cides the membership of the reserve 
board is to be broadened, it should 
not be restricted in the manner pro- 


Adoption of either of the proposals, 
leaders said, frankly, would leave the 
president the free hand he was said 
to desire in the selection of men, but 
they appeared to have assurance that 
agricultural interests would be given 
early representation on the board. 


U.S Money Operations 
Since Pre-War Times 
Total $200,000,000,000 


Washington, January 15.—Govern- 
ment financial operations since the 
country’s entrance into the world war 
involved more than $200,000,000,Q000, 
according to figures compiled today by 
the treasury on the basis of daily 
statements from April 6, 1917, to De- 
cember 31, 1021. 

This stupendous sum consisted of 
receipts, both ordinary and _ public 
debt, of more than $99,000,000,000 
balanced against disbursement of both 
classes of a like total. Starting on 
the eve of the war, April 5, 1917, 
with a net balance in the reneral fund 
of $92,000,000, receipts, exclusive of 
principal of public debt, from April 
6, 1917, to December 31, 1921, to- 
taled $24,018,000,000, while public 
debt receipts during the same period 
Disbursements, exclusive of public 
debt, for the period aggregated $45,- 
785,000,000, while public debt dis- 
bursements totaled $53,481,000,0U00,

BUSES LESSEE

cles has lessened somewhat, although 
my: — a that hve 
8 pra y une » acco ri) 
aA fr from Commercial Attache 
Herring at Berlin, made public tonight 
by the commerce department, 

Th feverish industria] activity and 
unusual speculation on the stock ex-

shortage of coal and raw materials and 
general increased guygee costs are 
making it difficult for industry, while 
a falling off in orders is noticeable. 


Murray Butler 
Against National 
Education Bureau 


——~ 


New York, January 15.—The plan 
to establish a national bureau of edu- 
cation is characterized by Nicholas 
Murray Butler, president of Columbia 
university, in his annual report made 
public today as a proposal to “bu- 
reaucratize and bring into uniformity 
the educational system of the whole 
United States while making the most 
solemn assurance that nothing of the 
kind is intended.” 

He urges the continuance of “the 
free and natural system of education 
that has grown up among us,” stating 
that “the glory and success of edu- 
cation in the United States are due to 
its reflections to the needs and am- 
bitions and capacities of local com- 
munities, and to its being kept in 
close and constant touch with the 
people themselves.” He says it is uni- 
versally acknowledged that the “un- 
happy subjection of the educational 
classes to the dictates of the political 
and military ruling groups were the 
direct result of the highly centralized 
and efficient control from Berlin of 
the nation’s schools and universities.” 

set up such a system here, he 
declares, would be to tap the federal 
treasury in the guise of aiding the 
states to establish again an army of 
bureaucrats in Washington and to 
aid “in effecting so great a revolution 
in our American government as one 
day to endanger its p gre nney yal 

Advocating a world revival of clas- 
sical study, Dr. Butler asserts that a 
beginning should be made at once to- 
ward repairing the damage done by 
the last generation’s select classics. 
He suggests that Athens itself might 
become “the effective center of a new 
renaissance, of a twentieth century re- 
vival of interest in the origins and 


spiritual accomplishments,” 

Since the civil war, he says, there 
has been a tendency in this country 
to look upon the college “as the most 
inviting and satisfactory form of coun- 
try club with incidental facilities for 
reading and study,” he blames “‘shift- 
less and ambitious parents” for the 
spread of this notion which has been 
aided in its growth by the rapid 
spread of the elective system of 
studies. 

“The result has been,” he points 
out, “that side by side with an earn- 
est, devoted and high-minded body of 
young college graduates, there has 
gone out into American life a very 
substantial group of those who have 
gained college degrees, but who are, 
to all intents and purposes, as un- 
disciplined and uneducated, both in 
mind and morals, as if they had en- 
joyed no advantage whatever. 


SARRAUT RETAINS 
PLACE IN CABINET 
OF NEW PREMIER 


Washington, January 15.—M. Sar- 
raut, head of the French delegation 
here, has accepted the offer of Pre- 
mier Poincare to remain as minister 
of colonies in the French cabinet, and 
will continue here at his present post 
on the French arms delegation. 

Sarraut is of the opinion that in 80 
far as the Washington conference is 
concerned, at least, there will be no 
change in policy: from that laid down 
by the Briand cabinet, and that the

WORK TO RECOVER 
BODIES OF MINERS 
BENEATH CAVE-IN 


Scranton, Pa., Janu 15.—Belief 
that the bodies of the three men en- 
tombed by a cave-in at the national 
mine of the Glen Alden Coal com- 
pany Wriday morning will be reached 
early tomorrow, was expressed  to- 
night by company officials and others 
engaged in the rescue work. About 
twenty acress of land went down with 
the cave. 

Qne hundred experienced miners 
continued to work in relays cleaning 
away the mass of debris, rock and coal 
in an effort to locate the entombed 
men. Hope of finding them alive, 
however, virtually has been aban- 
dored, ‘ 

Late tonight it was me ag that 
the rescue gangs had reached a point 
approximately fifty feet from where 
the men were last seen.

Poincare P Fails. 

The new premier achieved a notable 
success in limiting the ministerial 
crisis to three days, but failed to ac- 
complish the desire with which he is 
credited of forming a cabinet of wide 
national union on the lines of the cab- 
inets formed in 1914 and 1915 while 
he was president of the republic. Not 
that he could be expected to include 
the socialists who were represented 
in ,these ministries, for their press 
has seized upon the return of Poin- 
care to power to revive their charges 
that he personally was responsibie for 
the war. 

His partial failure as explained by 
the Petit Parisien may be attributed 
in part to the fact that the situation, 
although ve, cannot be compared to 
that existing in 1914 and 1916. ‘The 
chamber elected in 1919 comprises a 
majority known as the national bloc, 
which is in clear-cut opposition as re- 
gards internal policy to the socialist 
radical group, which previously was 
the largest and most important group 
in the chamber. 

M. Herriot, leader of the socialist 
radical group in the chamber, and M. 
Doumergue, leader of the corréspond- 
ing group in the senate, refused office 
but assured M. Poincare that hé-coul 
count on their support on foreign pol- 
icy. M. Sarraut, who held the port- 
folio of colonies under Briand and 
who now is in Washington, belongs to 
this group, but it is taken for granted 
that he will retain his present office. 
M, Laffont, the new undersecretary 
of -posts and telegraphs, also is a

TAX LAW CHANGES

physically defective, has been increas- 
ed from $200 to $400. As a concrete 
example—a married man whose 1921 
income was less than $6,000 and who 
is living with his wife and having 
two children under 18 years of age, 
is entitled to $2,50U *initial exemp- 
tion, together with $400 each for the 
two children, his total exemption be 
ing $3,300. 
Penalties Are Provided. 

Heavy penalties are provided for 
those who do not comply with every 
item of the income tax act. 

“[ want the public generally to 
know,” Commissioner Rose told The 
Oonstitution Sunday, “that the new 
income tax act is much simpler than 
the tax acts of former years, which 
were really difficult to understand. 

“We want the public to realize that 
this office is willing and anxious to 
extend every courtesy and every help 
— in epee out tax returns. 
Ixpert advice will be gladly given, 


jand I can state positively that the / da 


old bugaboo of filling out the re- 
turps is a thing of the past under 
the simplified blank system. 

“While it is possible that persons 
who know beyond the shadow of any 
doubt that they will not have to pay 
income tax may never fill out returns 
and may never be questioned by the 
government, my advice to everyone is 
tv fill out the blanks regardless of 
whether they must actually pay in- 
come tax or not. 


Fill Out Your Blank. 


“In checking over the returns 
years from now it is possible that 
the goverment may ask for informa- 
tion from people who have not filed 
their returns, and it will be mighty 
difficult for them to collect the data 
requested at that late date. My aa- 
vice is for everyone to play safe and 
fill out his blank.’ E 

Every person who made out his re- 
turn last year, Mr. Rose said, will 
shortly after January 18 received 
torough the mail a 1922 blank. If 
these are not received within a rea- 
sonable time after January 18 per- 
sons should call at Mr. Rose’s office 
and ask for the blank, 

Those who did not file returns 
last year should call at Mr. Rose’s 
office and ask for blanks, as they 
will not be mailed to them. 

“I want to particularly stress the 
importance of making early returns,” 
Mr. Rose stated. “If a great man 
people wait until just before March 
15, when the time for filing returns 
ends, there will be a terrible jam 
in this office and my force will not 
be able to handle the rush. If peo- 
rie make their returns promptly, 
there will not be a particle of trouble, 
but if they wait and crowd the of- 
fices so that we cannot handle them, 
they cannot expect us to protect them 
from the provisions of the act which 
provide severe penalties for not mak- 
ing returns before the time limit ex- 


pires.”” 
Statement by Rose. 


: The formal statement issued by 
Comcissioner Rose is ag follows: 

Forms 1040A, resived and simplified, for 
filing individual returns of income for the 
calendar year 10921 of $5,000 and less will

Atlanta, Ga., and the following branch of- 
tices, Macon and Savannah, A copy 
will be mailed to taxpayers who, last year. 
filed a return, but failure to receive the 
form does not relieve a taxpayer of his 
obligation to file a return on time—on or 
before March "15, 1922. ‘Tile form has been 
reduced from six to four pages, two of 
which are devoted to inatfuctions which 
should be carefully read by the taxpayer

One of the first donations received 
was that of George E. King, presi- 
dent of King Hardware company, who 
expressed his enthusiasm for the 
movement in a letter to Mercer in- 
closing a check for $100. Said Mr, 
King: 

“I do not recall at this time any 
one subscription that pleases me 
quite as much as the one 1 am now 
making to the greatest man that has 
beeh produced in this country, unless 
I might except Washington or Lin-

history will recognize Woodrow Wil- 
son as being the peer of any Ameri-

“I sincerely trust that the efforts of 
these people who are undertaking this 
worthy cause will meet with the abun- 
nt success that they deserve.”

Following is an outline of the foun- 
dation, made by the executive commit- 
tee: 

“A national committee of 250 repre- 
sentative men and women has under- 
taken to establish the Woodrow Wil- 
ron foundation. The purpose of the 
foundation is to honor a great Ameri- 
can and to create a method whereby 
public service will be encouraged and 
conspicuously recognized in this and 
future generations. 

“From the income of the foundation, 
the Woodrow Wilson award or awards 
will be granted in recognition of dis- 
tinguished public service. 

Popular Subscription. 

“To establish this foundation on a 
fitting basis, the national committee, 
through an organization in eac hstate, 
will make an appeal for a popular sub- 
scription. The amount of the fund 
sought is $1,000,000 or more. 

“The appeal will be issued to all 
who believe in those liberal and dem- 
ocratic principles that Woodrow Wil- 


son has so conspicuously championed, | | 


and who wish to perpetuate the in- 
fluence of America’s great leader, 

“After the fund has been raised a 
board of trustees, composed of emi- 
nent Americans, will ‘entrusted 
with its permanent administration. 

“The active campaign throughout 
the country will begin the week of 
January 15, 1922. ~ Subscriptions, 
however, will be received at any time 
at national headquarters. Checks may 
be made payable to the Woodrow 
Wilson foundation.” 

The Atlanta committee issued a 
statement Saturday calling on all 
Georgians to join in the movement to 
honor the former president and to 
establish a foundation to provide per- 

tual awards for distinguished pub- 
ie service. :

conduct shall govern the relationships 
of nations as well as individuals. 

“Proclaiming first this great moral 
law, and insisting that the thing that 
made a man great makes a nation 
great, service ahd unselfishness, he 
said : 


“*There have been other nations as

Co-operative Moves. 

Extension of the co-operative move- 
ment also is expected to be proposed 
to the conference. Smaller co-opera- 
tive organizations have proven suc- 
cessful, agricultural authorities said. 
and advocates of extension of the 
movement will be in the gathering of 
delegates. 

Leaders of the conference predict 
that the labor question inevitably will 
arise, since the presence of railway 
executives and Samuel Gompers, pres- 
ident of the American “ederation of 
Labor, and of many representative 
employers as conference members will 
bring the two sides of the question 
together. ‘The farmers, it was said, 
are vitally interested in the labor ques- 
tion through its effect on transporta- 
tion rates and because of a realization

In Georgia, South Carolina, New

work on the building of associations 
to enter the market in ‘1922 is well on 
toward completion. It has been be- 
gun in Alabama and Tennessee, and 
among the short staple growers of 
Mississippi, and will be begun during 
next two months, preliminary pub- 
licity having already appeared, in 
Louisiana and rida. 

The new states, including Georgia, 
if they obtain only the minimum sign- 
up required to make their marketing 
contract effective, will contro] more 
than a million bales of cotton. The 
ofganized states control today 1,600,-

The popular notion of putting a 
limb in a cast is not shared by any- 
body who has had his limb in a cast. 
Comfort is generally given instead 
of pain or discomfort, as the un- 
informed imagine, no matter what 
the disease.or injury may be. 
plaster of paris cast is the most ‘per- 
feet splint we have; and the purpose 
of a splint is to afford physiological 
rest to the diseased or injured part, 
as well as comfort. If old timers 
with limited training and little or 
no hospital experience did “bind on” 
splints sometimes with painful pres- 
sure, as though the purpose of the 
torture was to force something into

new not what they did. 

The question of the time when a

an individual problem in each case 
which calls for the skill and judg- 
ment of the physician with special 
experience in the treatment of infan- 


tile paralysis.

As to the tobacco business, you 
have in your city a ¢orporation 
chartéred for $700,000 to grow cigar 
leaf tobacco in thie section of 
Georgia and Florida, and there are 
millions of dollars invested in this 
section by the small farmers in the 
gtowing of cigar leaf tobacco, as 
well as in other sections of the 
United States; and so far as Cuba 
is concerned, those farmers down 
there, if they can keep this tariff 
measure from becoming a law, they » 
know that they will have an open 
field, as we farmers here would be 
out of business. 

Cuba has a prohibitive tariff on 
tobacco shipped in there, You could 
not ship a pound of our tobacco into 
Cuba for less than $5. So, if our 
farmers are to make a living and 
not be ruined forever, they must, 
be protected. 

So far as the Cubans are concern- | 
ed, we may be sorry for them and 
for those of our nationals that 
thought the little old U: 8. was not 
good enough for them, but we think 
more of our own firesides and @ 
wives and children than we can: 
possibly care for them.

5 " Debt Funding, 
'e Soldier Bonus and Anti-

BY JOHN GLEISSNER, 


- United News Staff 


Washington, January 15.—Con- 
gress thie week will direct its atten- 
tion ‘to three important measures, 
passage of which is desired by the ad- 
ministration—the foreign debt funding 


. se bill, the soldier bonus bill and the 


anti-lynching bill., 

The debt funding bill is to. be re 
ported out by the senate finance com- 
mittee probably on Monday, minus 
‘some of the restrictions: that have

The administration had urged pas- 
sage of this bill for months, and re- 
cently the president has exerted a 
strong pressure on the senate to obtain 
action in that body. 


After the debt funding bill is re-. 


ported out, the senate finance com- 
mittee will prepare a soldier bonus 
bill, with the idea of reporting it out 
in a short time. This measure, it is 
expected, will contain provisions for 
‘making its first payments through tax-

LESS MEAT IF BACK 
AND KIDNEYS HURT 


Take A Glass of Salts to 

Flush Kidneys If Bladder 
Bothers You—Drink Lots 
of Water. 


, en 


Eating meat regularly eventually 
produces kidney trouble in some form 
or other, says a well-known authority, 
because the uric acid in meat excites 
the kidneys, they become overworked; 
get sluggish; clog up and cause all 
sorts of distress, particularly back- 
ache and misery in the kidney region; 
rheumatic twinges, severe headaches, 
acid stomach, constipation, torpid 
liver, sleeplessness, bladder and urin- 
ary. irritation. 

The moment your back hurts or kid- 
neys aren’t acting right, or if bladder 
bothers you, get about four ounces of 
Jad Salts from any good pharmacy ; 
take a tablespoonful in a glass of wa- 
ter before breakfast for a few days 
and your kidneys will then act fine. 
This famous salts is made from the 
acid of grapes and lemon juice, com- 
bined with lithia, and has been used 
for generations to flush clogged kid- 
neys and stimulate them to normal 
activity; also to neutralize the acids 
in the urine so it no longer irritates, 
thus ending bladder disorders. 

Jad Salts cannot injure anyone; 
makes a delightful effervescent lithia- 
water drink which millions of men and 
women take now and then to keep 
‘the kidneys and urinary organs clean, 
-thus avoiding serious kidney disease.

MEMBERS OF 82D 


HERE NEXT MONDAY 


Thrilling narratives relating to the 
period during which he was an Amer- 


ican attache at Constantinpole, are , 
anticipated from Lieutenant Colonel 
R. H. Williams, chief-of-staff of the 
Fourth corps area, who will make the 
leading talk at the annual meeting 
of the Atlanta Kighty-second Division 
association next Monday night, at 8 
o'clock, in the assembly hall of the 
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Colo- 
nel Williams was American observer 
during the Dardanelles operations, and 
will give many facts concerning the 
Turks. 

Another feature of the gathering 
will be the election of the 1922 of- 
ficers of the divisional association, and 
discussion of the plans for a natjpnal 
reunion of this Atlanta-trained outfit. 
New York, from which city and en- 
virons a large number of the division 
personnel were drawn, and Atlanta, 
where the division got its training, 
are the two places which have been 
mentioned as possible reunion cities. 

Officers of the assuciation at pres- 
ent are Paul Warwick, president; 
George Harrison, vice president; Ar- 
thur Manning, secretary; J. H. Gil- 
bert, treasurer, @ndan executive com- 
mittee composed of John White, 
Clark Howell, Jr., Fonville MeWhor- 
ter and Dr. Leo P. Daly. Joe Cooke 
is chairman of a steering committee. 


RIDLEY TO REMAIN 
HERE IF CHURCH 
PAYS $8,000 DEBT 


If the congregation of the Central 
Baptist church is able to convince 
Dr. Caleb A. Ridley, pastor, that it is 
determined to pay off the $8,000 debt 
on the ‘church property at an early 
date, and make the church one of the 
leaders in Atlanta, he is willing to 
withdraw his resignation, he told the 
congregation at the morning service 
Sunday. . 

Dr. Ridley stated that he could take 
up other and more remunerative work 
should he leave his charge, but that if 
the congregation would convince him 
that it meant to work with enthusiasm 
for the advancement of the church, 
he would not only remain and continue 
to lead them, but would pay one-eigh 
of the debt upon the property. 

Dr. Ridley stated that it is his de- 
sire that the property adjoining the 
church be purchased, in order that the 
present building might be so enlarged 
that the seating capacity of the audi- 
torium be practically doubled. 


CHILD OF FORMER 
ATLANTAN KILLED 
WHEN HIT BY TRAIN 


Joyce Elizabeth Pyron, aged 5, only 
child of Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Pyron, 
formerly of Atlanta, was instantly 
killed when struck by a passenger 
train at the railroad station in-Hef- 
lin, Ala., at 6:30 o’clock Satyrday 
afternoon, according to news received 
in this city Sunday. Mr. Pyron is 
station agent and telephone operator 
at Heflin. 

A negro nurse attending the little 
girl had permitted her to walk upon 
the track in front of the approaching 
train, it is stated, and the child was 
struck before the train, attached to 
the Atlanta-Birminghem division of 
the Southern railway, could be brought 


to a stop. 
The child will be buried in Ac- 

worth Monday morning. Besides her 

parents, she is survived by her grand- 
rents, Mrs. Pyron, of Acworth, and 
r. and Mrs. G. D. Callahan, of 


Atlanta.

coming tion th the 
generation thro 
of the amendment. ie pp gima 

“The younger generation will look 
on the pobibition amendment as a 
settled law. They will not see it as 
some of us may have, who lived dur- 
ing the sway of the liquor traffic. 
The next generation will know noth- 
ing of the conditions their forbears 
did. For them the eighteenth amend- 
ment will have the stamp of consti- 
tutional authority.” 

Judge T. O. Hathcock, of the 
municipal court, made an address on 
the subject, “How Citizens, Men and 
Women, Can Help Enforce the Law.” 
Judge Hathcoek stressed the need of 
a respectful attitude toward the au- 
thority of the law. He stated that 
the maker of home brew is more dif- 
ficult to deal with than the bootlegger, 
who does his business in the open. 

Recalling the recent prosecution of 
bunco men in Atlanta, when Solicitor 
Boykin secured evidence from private 
citizens through hundreds of letters, 
Judge Hathcock declared that much 
valuable aid eould be given in the same 
way to the prohibition officers. 

Dr. C. O. Jones, of the Anti-Saloon 
league, was on the program for a 
speech for the occasion. Congrega- 
tional singing was in charge of Profes- 
sor Boatman, leader of the 
Wesley Memorial choir, and Mrs. A. 
B. Cunyus, of Cartersville, rendered 
several solos, among them one with 
words written by Mrs. Dillard. 

Although the date of the second an- 
niversary of the triumph of the prohbi- 
tion movement is Monday, the celebra- 
tion was held Sunday in order that 
more might be able to participate in 
the public observance. 

- The anniversary was observed all 
over the United States by meetings 
7 by branches of the W. C. T. 

. The four local W. C. T. U.’s of 
Atlanta united in the celebration held 
at Wesley Memorial. 


LAURENS COTTON 
GINNING REPORT 
SHOWS DECREASE 


Dublin, Ga.,‘January 15.—(Spe- 


cial.)—-The number of bales of cotton 
ginned in Laurens county up to and 
including December 31, 1921, were 
11,112 bales, as compared with 17.487 
bales for the same period in 1920, a 
decrease of more than 6,000 bales. 
This report is practically final, as only 
one more will be made, and it is now 
thought certain that the total ginnings 
for the 1921 crop will be considerably 
less than 11,500 bales. While the 1921 
crop was small when the usual pro- 
duction of this county is considered, it 
is considerably larger than was ex- 
pected even up to the beginning of the 
ginning season. A still further reduc- 
tion in acreage for 1922 is sure, and 
agitation for as grevt a reduction as 
50 per cent of 1921 acreage is gaining 
some followers, and the crop for cur- 
rent year will hardly be more than 75 
per cent of the 1921 crop.

“ 


With the narrative of the resur- 
rection as his theme, Dr. L. W. Mun- 
hall, of Philadelphia, noted evange- 
list and Bible teacher, gripped a large 
audie 
Park’ Methodist church. 7 

Dr. Munhall is en route home from 
Macon, where he addressed a religious 
conference, drawing great crowds With 
his sermons. Monday morning at 11 
o'clock he will deliver his famous in- 

irational lecture, “The Book of 
Books,” at the Wesley Memorial 
ehureh, and the public is invited to 
hear him. 

Twenty years ago Dr. Munhall, 
preaching in the old Maddox-Rucker 
warehouse, conducted one of the big- 
gest revivals Atlanta had ever wit- 
He began the revival at Trin- 
ity Methodust church, but the edifjce 
proved too small to accommodate the 
tremendous crowds that flocked to 
hear him. 

In his opening remarks Sunday 
night the speaker went back to this 
meeting ‘and reealled as among the 
figures who attended, W. A. Hemp- 
hill and others, some of whom are yet 
living, but others of whom have pass- 
ed toward the resurrection, he said. 
. He expressed his pleasure at return- 
ing and speaking to the people here 
again. Present in the congregation 
were a number of persons who had 
heard his, message in the warehouse 
meetings. 

With eloquent and graphic words 
the minister spoke on the life, death 
and resurrection of Jesus, and declar- 
ed that the Bible is incontrovertible 
proof of a resurrection reuniting the 
soul with the physical body, asserting 
that “in this very body I shall walk 
the golden streets in heaven in union 
again with my family and friends.” 

As Jesus ascended to heaven Dodily, 
visibly, in clouds, with angels and with 
witnesses to his ascension, Dr. Mun- 
hall declared that he would return to 
earth In the same manner. He warn- 
ed his hearers to make it their bnsi- 
ness to be ready at all times for His 
coming. 

So complete is Dr. Munhall’s mem- 
ory and knowledge of the Bible, it is 
stated that if it were blotted out of 
existence he could reproduce it. In 
addition to lecturing and preaching, 
Dr. Munhall is editor of The Eastern 
Methodist. 


Seek Two Women 


Trial Witnesses 


Macon, Ga., January 15.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Atlanta and Fulton county 
authorities have been asked to aid in 
the search for Mrs, Gladys Camp- 
bell and Mrs, Ester Self, wanted in 
Bibb county a8 principal witnesses 
in the four-way kidnaping trial sched- 
uled to come up this week in the 
eriminal branch of Bibb superior 
court. The alleged abduction, occur- 
ring early. in the fall, caused a rip- 
ple of -excitement in Macon and is 
based on the alleged forcible carrying 
off of Miss Oline Vinson, 16-year-old 
Macon girl. at 

_At the preliminary hearing. of Wal- 
ter’ Overcash, who also is indicted on 
a charge of violating the prohibition 
law; Thomas McDonald, A. B. Smith 
and Alvin Yarbrough it developed 
that Mrs. Campbell and Mrs. Seif re- 
turned to Atlanta after winding up 
their alleged night-time escapade at 
Griffin. An attempt to locate the 
missing matrons was made at that 
time. and has been continued without 
success. 

Miss Vinson asserts that it was a 
case of “drink liquor or walk home,” 


land that rather than trudge many 


miles along lonely country roads she 
elected to remain with the party. She 
accuses Smith, a married man, of at- 
tacking and brutally beating her while 
they, remained in. the automobile when 
other members of the party visited 
the farm house after gasoline. 

McDonald, married since the com- 
mencement of proceedings against him. 
averred at the commitment hearing 
that he had to obtain gasoline sev- 
eral times during the party’s drive to 
Atlanta. He is charged by OUOvercash, 
who did not make the Atlanta excur- 
sion, with having: purloined the Over- 
cash car for the. party. McDonald 
told the court that .when the other 
members of the party insisted on be- 
ing carried to Atlanta he had to 
give in. ‘ 

Solicitor-Geperal Charles H. Gar- 
rett said today that he has come into 
possession of new -evidence which will 
support Miss Vinson’s story of the 
roadside attack. It is expected that a 
bitter fight will be waged during the 
trial of this case and a delicate defi- 
hition of the application of the mean- 
ing of the Jaw relative to kidnaping 
will be exacted.

BOSTON, 

Dear Sneezy: Well, we had a par- 
ty, Sneezy, and it was at Miriam 
Modisett’s house. It was her birth- 
day, and hardly, if ever, did I ever go 
to a place where they was so many 
different kinds of things to eat. She 
got lots of presents, for when you go 
to a birthday party you got to bring 
presents to whose birthday it it. I 
would a brought a better present for 
Miriam only when I got 35 cents saved 
up it was the last day that Doug 
Fairbanks was to be at the Miramar, 
and it cost 17 cents. That only left 
18 cents, and 1 got a handkerchief 
with an M on it to stand for her 
name, and so if she lost it she would 
know it was hers. That left 3 cents 
over. 

She was very pleased with it, and 
her mother, too. Some kids’ presents 
cost more, but the nail file that Mel- 
lencamp gave only cost 10 cents, and 
Mooky didn’t even give that much, 
for he lost his 20 cents. 

There was both boys and girls at 
the party. That kind of a party is 
nice, only you got to be all dressed 
up. You shake hands with the folks 


all 


— 


Wheneyer any one in the neigh- 
borhood has a party, you'll find 
Chip and Tubby and all the others 
of the “gang” on hand, having a 
great time. 

This week in his letter to 
Sneezy about Miriam Modisett’s 
party, Chip tells about a new 
game they played—Boston, it's 
called, 

Like all of the Play Man’s 

mes, Boston is a top-notcher. 

ust try it. 
—THE EDITOR. 


=* 


when you come, and say to the one 
what has the party, “Many happy 
returns of the day.” 

All us guys sat together and all 
the girls sat together and all the 
fun we had at first was pushing Pud- 
dy and Melly around and getting their 
goat. The girls at parties always get 
together and giggle and whisper. It’s 
all much better when the _ eating 
starts, but before we had the eats 
we played a game and it was a corker. 
If you have parties it is lots of fun 
and you can play it. 


It’s called Boston. The way you 


-. do it is to hav€ two rows of chairs, 


and all the kids sit down but one, and 

he is in the middie. HKyerybody has 

a number and if thirteen play the 

game 1 is the lowest and 13 is the 

highest number. ‘The boy in the cen- 

ter is blind-folded and he calls out - 
two numbers like 5 and 3 or 6 and 4, 

or any other two numbers under the 

high number. 

The kids who have their number 
called must change seats, and if the 
one in the middle catches one who is 
trying to grab a new place, that one 
is it.” : 

Every now and then the one in the 
middle hollers “Boston,” and that 
means that all the kids must change 
seats, and while they are making a 
grand rush the one who is it tries to 
get an empty seat, and if he does the 
one who is left out and don’t get a 
seat is it. 

We had an awful lot of fun play- 
ing this, Sneezy, only sometimes you 
would sit in a girl's lap. Not on 
purpose, but by accident. Some laugh 
then, Sneezy. 


Your friend, yours truly, 
- CHIP

SURPRISES PROMISED . 
N BG MINSTREL SHOW 


Yaraab temple’s minstrel show 
Tuesday and Wednesday nights at the 
Auditorium will bring some surprises 
to the public of Atlanta. For in- 
stance, Frank A. COundell, director 
of Yaraab’s chanters, director of the 
Scottish Rite choir and known 
throughout the south as one of the 
foremost tenors of this section, has 
never been heard in public in any- 
thing but serious “high-brow” songs. 
but in the Shrine minstrels of 1922 
he is all blacked up and will sing “l'm 
Wild About Moonshine.”’ 

Then there are Charley Chalmers 
and Tom Hoffman, two more singers 
who are famed for high class work: 
but Charley from behind hig disguise 
of burnt cork cuts loose with “Uh 
Huh,” while Tom gets the whole 
crowd of blackface artists around him 
and makes them “Read "Fm _ and 
Weep.” Nobody would expect Joe 
Perry or Billy Haas to sing anything 
but rollicking, funny songs, and that 
is why they do them so well. 

The big dress rehearsal wil! be held 
in the Auditorium Monday night, be- 
ginning at 7:30 p. m., and director 
Perrin G. Somers declares that the 
performance will be the best amateur 
production he has put on in some 
twenty years’ experience. 

Tickets at $1 each are for sale at 
all hotels and many other places. In: 
answer to many queries, it is emphat- 
ically stated that both performances 
are open to the public. ‘There will 
be no reserved seats and the curtain 
goes up at 8:15 sharp. 


Pasig Lair Indorses 
Henry for Position 
Of Postmaster Here 


Lasig lair No. ¥, of the Military 
Order of the Serpent, at a meeting 
held at the Auditorium Sunday after- 
noon, adopted a resolution indorsing 
Henry for 
the office of postmaster of Atlanta. 
A similar resolution had previously 
been passed by the local camp of 
Spanish War Veterans of which Mr. 
Henry is a member. Copies were sent 
to President Harding, to the Georgia 
representatives in the national senate 
and congress and to other officials. 

The resolutions also urged that the 
president amend his preference order 
of October 14, 1921, to inelude the 
veterans of all wars, instead of vet- 
erans of the world war only. Mr. 
Henry had claimed preference in his 
application because of his service in 
the Spanish-American war and the 
aro ome insurrections. 

icers of Pasig lair, recently elect- 
ed, were installed at the meeting as 
follows: R. L. Henry, gu gu ndsis- 
simo; John P. Haunson, thrice infa- 
mous and inferior gu gu and lord high 
keeper of the sacred amphora; N. A. 
Streebe, most highest datto. and Sam 
Crane, Joe Wilson, F. M: Turner and 
J. J. Huff, slick and slimy keepers of 
the ophidian. 

Preced the seasion a cert was 

ven by the brass band Fitzhugh 

camp No. 6, of Spanish veterans,

A CONSOLATION PRIZE—AND THE BEST OF ALL 
you from the best of friends. ‘Bui. 


A frieind of mine ‘has lately passed 
through a very unhappy experience. 
It was of such a nature that while it 
lasted: she could net,very well confide 


_jn anyone about it. She was speaking 


of this phase to me afterwards. 

“Tt made it doubly hard,” she said, 
“to have to fight the thing all alone. 
If I could only have gone: to someone 
for sympathy it wouldn’t have been 
quite so much of a struggie.” 

My friend bas come out of her trial 
trumphant and with a new strength 
of character, a new hold on herself, 


What do I mean by character? 

It is very ‘hard to’ express it, ex- 
actly. I mean poise, mental control, 
courage, self-honesty and self-control. 

I mean that hardihood of soul which 
is the spiritual counterpart of a 
strong and muscular body able to en- 
dure hardships and trials. 

I mean that quality which we 
sometimes see reflected in the faces of 
men and women who have passed 
through the hard places of life and

Few Would Choose the Hard Places. 
But— 

I think I mean about the same thing 
the Bible means when it talks about 
wisdom. We think of wisdom as a 
synonym for knowledge, but the wis- 
dom of which the psalmist sings that 
“is more to be desired than gold, yea 
than much fine gold,” is something 
far more than knowledge. It is knowl- 
edge used to live by, and that is pretty 
near a definition of character. 

No one, as I think I have said be- 
fore, wants to pass through adversi- 
ties and sorrows and all the other 
hard places of life. But it is some- 
thing to know that each time we face 
a trial with all the courage and forti- 
tude we can summon, we build within 
ourselves the character that shall make 
the next difficulty easier to face.

Influence On the New Spring Fash- 
jons By the Titled Exiles From 
Their Living By Sewing and Creat- 
ing Frocks, 


The wise should look to Moscow. 
or what was Moscow, for the new 
inspiration in clothes. 

Paris is under the thrall of the 
grand duchesses and princesses who 
are begging for aid for their ouvroirs 
where are supported the very poor 
exiles who escaped persecution from 
Lenin. The ‘subject is almost a ma- 
nia in Paris. It began last summer 
when the Americans were begging aid 
for the devastated areas in France, 
and the French were begging for the 
refugees from Russia who had taken 
up their habitation in Paris. If the 


» affair hadn’t been so serious, it would 


have been comic. 

This mid-season the great HKussian 
ball in Paris in aid of the exiles 
brought together all society and those 
veho are curious of the doings of so- 
ciety and the result was not alone a 
goodly sum of money for thousands 
who «re really in a pitiable state of 
destitution, much wore than the Bel- 


f gians during the war, for they have 


inch of land to call their own 
ay of getting places to work, 
"ball resulted in a mad attempt 
' yt all new clothes into Rus- 
sian fashions. We shall see much 
of the result from this day on. 
Already the dressmakers of Paris 
are wearing the gorgeous blouses de- 
signed by the Grand Duchess Marie 
Paviovna and the Princess Ousouroff 
and by seventeen other titled emi-

food. What with Paris under the 
thrall of Russian sentiment and 
Washington giving itself up to anoth- 
er great social appeal for aid, there 
is no doubt of the influence that such 
sentiment will give a tremendous in- 
spiration toward the splendid and col- 
orful fashions to which old Russia 
gave birth. 


At the moment in Paris the blouse 
and the headdress of Russia are in 
the ascendancy. The former is avail- 
able for thé majority, but the latter 
will tickle the fancy of those who 
aim to dress brilliantly at night. 


The overblouse worn by the great 
Russians to create a demand for it 


what the crudity of our Indian blouses 
which were advanced two years ago. 
There is the same patterning of bril- 
liantly colored cotton threads on a 
cream or white background. The 
blouse is worn over the skirt without 
a belt, the sleeves are aslo or 
short as one wishes. The neckline is 
slightly round in front and rather 
high at back. 


The French dressmakers who are 
making a feature of such blouses have 
departed from the original cotton 
foundation and substituted red crepe 
de chine, also yellow and black. These 
foundations, holding as they do the 
bands of cross stitch and lattice work 
done in rainbow colors give one a 
sense that nd mere black frock can 
hope to rival such splendor. The dress- 
makers are taking up the Kussian 
idea with all the more vehemence be- 
cause it promises a break with black 
by the public.

CHAPTER XIX. 

By the dim light in his squalid 
room, Harry L. Rasher read the let- 
ter from his trustee. 

“Romisky’s name has often come up 
in directors’ meetings. Although out- 
wardly the bitterest agitator in the 
mills, he is really one of Mr. Stabbs’ 
most trusted henchmen. He is on the 
secret pay roll as Antonio Robinson 
and his checks are deposited under 
that name in the Titanic Trust com- 
pany in this city. His double rela- 
tion with the company has been the 
cause of much dissension in the meet- 
ings, as several of the directors are 
bitterly opposed to double dealing of 
this kind. It is only because of 
Stabb’s insistence that Romisky’s 
services are invaluable that he has 
been retained. 

“I do not know what you have in 
mind, but I should be failing in my 
duty did I not warn you to go slow 
in controversy with him. He is a dan- 
gcrous man and had a criminal record 
in St. Louis about fifteen years ago, 
where; if I recollect correctly, he was 
known as Dave Rattsnick.” 

Rasher wrote at once requesting 
that Romisky’s criminal record be 
traced and reported as soon as pos- 
sible. 

“This bird is going to be sorry he 
started anything.” 

After a while Rasher’s failure to 
put in his usual appearance at the 
Popular Pool rooms was attributed to 
fear. It was recalled that he fre- 
quently accompanied Miss Brook on 
her little expeditions of helpfulness, 
and this was now interpreted as evi- 
dence of softness. 

“He’s only a sissy,” one man said, 


“chasin’ round with a dame and car- 
ryin’ baskets!’ 

It was not long before the under- 
current of comment about Rasher and 
Romisky reached the ears of Mary 
Brook. From the women came va- 
rious versions, but all agreed on the 
essential fact that Romisky was for 
some reason determined to run Harry 
Rasher out of town. 

She knew Tony Romisky. Upon 
rare occasions he ¢ame to the man- 
ager’s office. As he was the’ leader 
of a considerable element in the la- 
bor party, she assumed that these 
visits had something to do with labor 
disputes. 

She now recalled that he had been 
with Mr. Stabb only a few days be- 
fore. He had come out smiling. She 
wondered if that visit had anything 
to do with Rasher, but dismissed the 
idea as unlikely. Had she known what 
had transpired in Mr. Stabb’s office 
when Rasher himself had been there 
three weeks before she would have 
thought differently. 

For several days she had missed 
the evening walk with Rasher up the 
long hill to her gate. Was he afraid 
to appear on the streets? Or had 
he already left town? The thought 
disturbed her so much that she could 
not bear to remain in doubt. A tele- 
phone call to his boarding house in- 
formed her that he had been, there 
at breakfast and that his things were 
still in his room. 

She resolved to send for him. 

That evening all the men not on 
duty would be at a big meeting in an 
unused movie theater. It was a par- 
ticularly important meeting called by 
Romisky for the purpose of formu- 


lating certain demands on the com- 
pany, and intimations had gone forth 
that anybody failing to attend for rea- 
sons other than work would regret it. 

Under the circumstances Mary 
Brook reasoned that Rasher would 
not attend, but her messenger, a de- 
voted little boy, brought back word 
that he had gone out. She dismiss- 
ed at once the thought of danger to 
him. With Romisky and most of the 
other unoccupied men busy, he could 
go out safely. So she spent the eve- 
ning with mind at ease. 

At the meeting hall five or six hun- 
dred men had gathered. Romisky was 
on the platform. Dense clouds of to- 
bacco smoke hung over the audience. 
When, finally, the business before the 
meeting had been concluded, Romisky 
did not dismiss them as usual. In- 
stead, he rose to speak, and a dead 
silence ensued. 

ere’s. a man in this town that 
don’t belong here,” he announced, and 
every one knew whom he was refer- 
ring to. “He ain’t one of us. He’s 
a crook, and he’s afraid to show his 
face among us honest men.” Thus 
began his speech, and as he worked 
himself into a thunderous rage he was 
suddenly conscious that every eye be- 
fore him had turned and was staring 
at one side of the stage. 

He swung around and beheld Harry 
I... Rasher approaching from the 
wings. : | 
“T understand you are looking for 
me, Mr. Romisky,” said Rasher.

that they were at school they had

“You don’t have to be wonder- 
fully developed physically to starr 
playing basket ball,” says Mr. 
Hammesfahr. “That will come 
with the playing of the game. Just 
get out with the other fellows and

Stand twenty-five or thirty 
feet from the basket and toss the ball. 
Never make a long shot without fol- 
lowing it up. If the basket is missed 
you still have a chance to recover 
the ball and take a shorter, or follow- 
up shot. The follow-up shot should 
not be used after a long shot only, 
however. Follow all of your shots. 


The best shot for the basket is made 
from the chest and upward. It is the 
hardest for an opponent to guard. The 
figure on the extreme right of our pic- 
ture shows how the ball is held. Get

‘Oriental reserve in these matters. 


The people of every class in our 
principal “parent countries”—Great 
Britain and Ireland—dislike and sus- 


| pect any parade of affection quite as 


much as the Chinese do. And since 
our cdde is derived chiefly from these 
ancestral lands, it is equally bad form 
in America to make public display of 
private feelings. Indeed, here, 
abroad, a man and wife given to 
praising’ each other, or to the use of 
endearing terms “before folks,” are 
open to suspicion of insincerity, as 
well as of bud manners.

someone they’ve known for a long 
time—”’ 

“Vera Dayton?” asked Jeanne 
quietly. 

He. looked surprised. 

“How did you know?” 

“Adele Parkinseh told me first. 
ia Just this afternoon, Miss 
Dayton herself gave me to undérstand 
that there was a tacit agreement to 
that effect.” 

He frowned and released her hand. 

“Lord, what gossips some women 
are! . . And Vera—it seems to 
me it was in rather questionable taste 
for her to insinuate stich a thing.” 

Jeanne laid her hand on his arm. 

“Please!” she said. “Don’t mistake 
my attitude in the matter. I haven’t 
a flicker of jealotsy. It is an emotion 
I’ve never experienced. . . In this 
instance, I merely want to be sure of 
my ground before I- set foot on it. I 
am giad that I know how matters 
stand between Miss Dayton, your fam- 
ily and yourself. Otherwise I might 
at: done or said something very tact- 
ess.” 

He took her hand again and squeez- 
ed her fingers gratefully. 

_ “Jeanne, you’re a wonder! There 
isn’t many a.chap’s fiancee who would 
look at things so sensibly !” 

Jeanne smiled into the warm-scented 
darkness. 

The car turned in presently at a 
massive gateway. A winding drive, 
bordered with neatly-clipped shrubbery, 
wound through a park, lighted here and 
there by brilliant clusters of electrics. 
Through the thickly-placed trees 
Jeanne caught a glimpse of a fountain

and, winter though it was, she could 
hear’ its musical splash. 

A great house of creamy-white mar- 
ble, with graeeful flanking verandas, 
lopmed suddenly around a curve in the 
drive. Conventionally etched against 
the pale background were tiny fur 
trees at windows, doorways, and 
guarding the broad marble stairway 
that approached the stately entrance. 
From windows, whose draperies wete 
drawn to give a glimpse of the warm 
interior, lights the eolor of the pink 
heart of a seashell shone forth into 
the night. It was as though every 
light in the house gave out that rose- 
flush radiance..'The effect against the 
creamy marble was like the translu- 
cence of a fairy palace, Jeanne 
thought. 

A servant in uniform ran down the 
steps, and opened the door of the car. 
Barstowe assisted Jeanne to alight and 
accompanied her into the house, turn- 
ing her over to a stately black-garbed 
woman whom he presented as Miss 
Jennings, the hoysekeeper.

A jittle of the cream can be warmed

rub it thoroughly all round the upper

not to rub it over too much of the

HEART EAVESDROPPING 


It is an advantage to the boy who 
lives next door to the girl he is conrt- 
ing that he knows more t her than 
his rivals. For instance, Bill Rohe 
knew it was Prudence Seymour’s habit 
to strum the piano a few moments 
every night just before going to bed.

the therraometer that told the tempera- 
ture of her emotions. 

By listening intently from the shad- 
ows of his next-door veranda after a 


call on Prudence, Bill would hear iff 


his visit had been appraised a success. 
Dreamy, heart-contented airs from 
Prudence’s piano would mean that she 
was carrying a tender image of him 
off to dreamland with her. Jerky 
musie or a few banging chords were 
symptomatic of annoyance. Worse 
still was a flick of her fingers down 
the keyboard. Worst of all was a 
rumbling, discordant pam made by her 


open hand being brought down angrily ; 
She had never) 
pammed after a visit by Bill, but he , 
knew it was worst of all because the | 
young men who had inspired it were |

Never was there an unsatisfactory eve-

jerky music and cranky chords on his 
score. 

To end the painful suspense Bill got 
to the point of asking Prudence to 
marry him. She blushed and would 
not look him in the eye. Twisting 
furiously at a crease in her skirt, upon 
which she held her gaze, she said she 
would have to think about it. ; 

Bill, with hardly a breath left in 
him, backed out of the house. A min- 
ute later he found that he was trem- 
bling violently as he stood on his 
veranda and waited for the strains 
from Prudence’s piano that would tell

There is a sense of coming spring 
even on the dampest and gloomiest 
day of mid-winter if you go shopping 
to feast your eyes on the new cotton 
materials already on display in the 
stores for you choose from in planning 
your early spring wardrobe. ‘These 
are veritable harbingers of spring, and 
when they first appear on the scene 
shortly after Christmas they somehow 
start our fagged pulses to beating 
more quickly. We may have forgot- 
ten for the time just what a gay, fes-. 
tive, bright time spring and young 
summer really are. Cottons are spe- 
cially pleasant fabrics. In the first 
place, we are now permitted to wear 
bright colors. again, and now the man- 
ufacturers of cottons have employed as 
skilled colorists and designers in the 
making of cottons as do the silk man- 
ufacturers. And cottons take the col- 
ors in a way that is all their own. 
You know: for yourself that bottle 
green, lemon yellow, or henna, for in- 
stance, appear entirely different in 
an English sateen than in a silk satin. 
Again these colors have a quality all 
their own when we find them in or- 
gandie or gingham. The lover of col- 
or can not but get joy out of seeing 
how these different cotton textures 
reveal the beauties of color, — 

And even though you are not think- 
ing of Palm Beach, it is none too soon 
to busy yourself with thin dresses for 
spring and summer. It is something 
of a tonic to work on these bright 
fresh fabrics when damp winter is 
still in the air and when spring lags 
at the threshold taxing our patience. 
Calicoes and cotton sateens will still 
play an important part in the higher 
quality of children’s and women’s 
frocks, and there are many of these 


the door to Stanley’s room started to 
open, so Phil ducked back. He didn’t 
want to run any risk. of his friend 
seeing him should he come out for a 
drink or to use the phone in the hall. 

Again Phil waited. Then he opened 
the door and looked again. The coast 
seemed clear. He got his hat and 
then backed out, very slowly, closing 
the door quite softly, and stepping on 


tiptoe. 

He thought he heard something, and 
he whirled about guickly. There, at 
the end of the hall, Stanley,, stitr 
wearing his wraps, was tiptoeing to- 
wards thi + stairs.

ducted her almost awed Jeanne. To 
think that she’ was aspiring to this! 

It had been easy to speak glibly of 
millionaires and _ multi-millionaires. 
The homes which she had visited as a 
result ef Canby’s friendship had be- 
longed to people of great wealth, but 
there had been none’like this. As she 
looked around her covertly, while a 
trim French maid took her wrap and 
proffered the cosmetics of the dressing 
table, Jeanne realized why this house 
was the loveliest she could ever hope to 
see. 

It was unforgettable because it had 
personality. Here was no product of 
an exclusive decorator! No conglom- 
erate transportation of the treasures 
of Venetian palaces, Parisian salons, 
or English castles! 

It was a hotse that was purely, 
charmingly, tastefully and richly the 
product of Americans who had more 
than wealth, who had good taste and 
culture and indomitable personality. | 
Not a detail that came to Jeanne’s at- 
tention—and before the evening was | 
over, she had seen every part of the 
house, from the attic storerooms to the 
laundry tubs—had been left to archi- 
tect or decorator. 

And she would some day rule here! 

That was the thought which re- 
peated itself in her mind as she slow- 
ly desended the stairway to the draw- 
ing room, her white draperies gliding 
after her over the old gold carpet. 

Half-way down the broad stairway, | 
she half-started and almost stopped: 
the waving feather fan in her hand . 
was stilled. | i 

She had not realized that her prog- | 
ress was Visible from the great door ' 
of the dra room, and that an el- 
derly man woman were watching , 
ber descent. Vic was beside them. |

exercise that will limber you up, for 
if any player on the ream must be 
quick of movement, it is the forward. 

There is a type of forward who, 
realizing that it is his duty to pass 
the ball to another player even though 
he is so closely covered by the oppos- 
ing guards that his shot at the basket 
will be useless. 

Don’t be that kind of a forward. 
Let some one else have a chance at 
the basket if you see that he is more 
likely to score than .you are. ;

write the last article of this series. 
The subject will be the position of

help out the ball in your team’s 
basket.” 


Should you be preparing to play the 
position of forward on a_ basketball 
team, as many moments of your spare 
time .as possible should be utilized 
in shooting baskets. A forward’s 
main duty is to do the scoring for his 
team. 

At first, practice should consist of 
throwing the ball through the loop at 
close range. Pick out an imaginative 
spot on the backboard and throw at 
this spot,so that the ball will rebound 
at an angle and fall through the loop. 

The little black cross on the back- 
board on the right side of the above 
‘ illustration is the spot picked out by 
the basket shooter. The ball should 
bounce from this spot through the 
basket. 

Practice Long Shooting, Too. 

The next step is to learn to shoot a 
basket without having the ball touch 
the backboard. 

Learn next to shoot baskets from a 
radius of about 15 feet. Here you 
will find that the loop shot is more 
successful than a bank shot. The

“Longriders?” queried Bard. — 

“Fellers that got tired of workin’ 
and took to ridin’ for their. livin’. 
Mostly they worked in little gangs of 


five and six. ‘They'd ride into Eldara |* 


end blow ap the safe in the bank one 
day and five days later they’d te 250 
miles away stoppin’ a train at Lewis 
Station. 

“Now and then a gang held together 
long enough to raise so much he!! that 
they got known from one end of the 
range to tke other. Mostly they held 
together because they had a leader 
who knew how t> handle ’em and who 
kept ’em under his thumb. That was 
the way with old Piotto. 

“He had five men under him, They 
was all hell-benders who had ridden 
the range alone and had their share of 
fights and killings, which there wasn’t 
one of ’em that wouldn’t have been 
good enough to go leader in any other 
crew, but they had to knuckle under 
to old Piotto. He had these five men, 
and then he had his daughter, Joax. 
She was better’n two ordinary men 
herself. 

“About a thousand times, I guess 
posses went out after Piotto, but they 
rever got within shootin’ distance. 
Finally Piotto got so confident that 
he started raidin’ ranches and carryin’ 
off members of «ell-off ranchers fami- 
lies to hold for ransom. 

“One time they held up a stage ‘and 
picked off of it two kids who was 
comin’ out from the east to try their 
hands in the cattle business. They was 
young, they looked like gentlemen. they 
was dressed nifty, and they packed big 
rolls. So wise old Piotto took ’em off 
into the hills and held ’em till their 
folks back east could wire out the 
money to save ’em. That was easy 
money for Piotto, but that was the 
beginnin’ of the -nd for him; because 
while they was waitin’, them two kids 
seen Joan and seen her good. One of 
’em was William Drew; one of ‘em 
was John Bard.” 

He turned to Anthony and saw that 
the latter was stern of face. He had 
eurely scored his point. 

Same name as yours, eh?” he ask- 
ed, to explain his turning. 

“Tt’s a common enough name,” mur- 
mured Bard. 

“Well, them two had come out to be 
partners, and there they was, fallin’ 
in love with the same girl. So when 
they got free they put their heads to- 
gether—bein’ uncommon wise kids— 
and figured it out this way. Neither 
of ’em had a chance workin’ alone to 
get Joan way from her father’s gang, 
but workin’ together they might have 
a ghost of a show. So they decided to 
stay on the trail of Piotto till they 
got Joan. Then they’d give her a 
choice between the two of ’em and the 
one that lost would simply back -off 


the boards. ‘ 

“They cone what they agreed. For 
six months they stuck on the trail of 
old Piotto and never got in hailin’ dis- 
tance of him. Then they come on the

gang, while they were restin’ up in 
the house of a squatter name Riley. 
“That was a pretty night. Drew 
and Bard went. through that gang. 
They killed three of the men witr their 


,guns; they knifed .another one, an’ 


they killed Riley with their \bare 
hands. It wasn’t no pretty sight to 
see—the inside of that house. And last 
of all they got Piotto, fightin’ like an 
old wildcat, into a corner with his 
daughter; and William Drew, he took 
Piotto into his arms and busted his 
back. That don’t sound possible, but 
when you see Drew you'll know how 
it was done. > 

“The girl, she’d been knocked cold 
before this happened. So while Bard 
and Drew sat together bindin’ up each 
other’s wounds—because they was 
shot pretty near to pieces—they talked 
it over and they seen pretty clear that 
the girl would never marry the man 
that killed her father. Of course, old 
Bill Drew, he’d done the killing, but 
that wasn’t any reason why he liad to 
‘ake the blame. 

“They made up their minds that 
right there and then with the dead 
men lyin’ all around ’em, they'd 
match coins to see which one would 
take the blame of havin’ killed Piotto 
—meanin’ that the other one would 
get the girl—if he could. | 

“And Bard lost. So he had to take 
the credit of havin’ killed old Pictto. 
That made the girl look sort of kind 
on Drew and she swore that sooner or 
later she‘d have the blood of Bard for 
what he’d done. She was a wild one, 
all right. 

“She was so wild that Drew. after 
they got married, took her over on 
the far side of the range dnd built 
that old house that’s rottin’ there now. 
Bard, he left the range and wasn’t 
never seen again, far as I know.” 

It was clear to Anthony, bitterly 
clear. His father had had a grim 
scene in parting with Drew and had 
placed the continent between them. 
And in the eastern states he had met 
rhat black-eyed girl, his mother, and 
loved her because she was 0 much like 
the wild daughter of Piotto. The girl 
Joan in dying had probably extracted 
trom Drew a promise that he would 
kill Bard, and that’ promise he had 
lived to fulfill. 

“Yep, and was buried under them 
two trees in front of the house. I don’t 
think she lived long after they was 
marked, but about that nobody knows. 
They was clear off by themselves and 
there isn’t anyone can tell about their 
life after they was married. All we 
know is that Drew didn’t get over her 
dyin’, He ain’t over it yet, and goes 
out to the old place every month or 50 


: 


to potter around the grave and keep 
the grass and the weeds off of it and 
clean the headstone.” 

Bard yawned, and patted idly the 
bianket where. it touched on the shape 
of the rvolver beneath. 


CHAPTER XVI. 

Nash knew that he would wake at 
the tirst hint of gray light and trusted 
that after the long ride of the day be- 
fore hig companion would still be fast 
asleep. hat haif light would be 
enough foc his work; but when he 
roused while the room was still scarce- 
ly more visible than if it were filled 
with a gray fog, he tound Bard already 
up and pulling on his boots, 

They were in the saddle in a. very 
few moments and started out break- 
tastless. The rain long agu had 
ceased, and there was only the solemn 
silence of the brown hills around them. 

Soon they reached a little creek 
whose current, barely knee deep, roam- 
ed up around the shoulders of the 
korses and set them staggering. 

“The Savecack will be hell,” said 
Nash, “and we'd better cut straight 
for the ford.” 

“How long will it take?’ 

vAdd about three hours to the trip.” 
date back in Eldara tonight.” 

“Then look for yourself and make 
up your mind for yourself,” said Nash 
drily for they topped a hill, and below 
them saw a mighty yellow flood pour- 
ing down the valley, threaded with 
many a ridge of white and swirling 
bubbles. 

“The Suaverack,” said Nash. “Now 
what d’you,think about fording it?” 

“It ism’t the date; it’s the promise I 
gave,” answered the other, watching 
ihe current with a cool eye, “besides, 
I was.a youngster I used to do things 
like this for the sport of it.” 

They rode down to the edge of the 
stream. 

“How about it Nash, will you tdke 
the chance with me?” 

And the other, lovking down: “Try 
the current I’ll stay here on the shore 
and if it gets too strong for you I'll 
throw out a rope, eh? But if you can 
make it, I'll follow suit.” 

Still never turning his back on the 
cowpuncher, who was now uncoiling 
his lariat and preparing it for a cast, 
Bard edged the piebald into the cur- 
rent. He felt the mustang stagger as 
the water came knee-deep, and he 
checked the horse, casting his eye from 
shore to shore and summing up the 
chances. 

He touched the piebald with the 
spurs, and the gallant little horse 
floundered forward, lost footing: and 
struck into :whter . beyond “its depth. 


’t do it; remember ‘that little

behind, holding with his left hand to |! 
the tail of ‘the struggling horse and 
ticking to aid the progress. 


~ Their progress at first was good, but’ 
us they neared the central portion of 
the water they were swept many yards 
downstream for one that they made in| | 
a transverse direction. Twice they 
missed projecting rocks by the narrow- 
est margin, and then something like 
an exceedingly thin and exceeding 
Strong arm caught Anthony around 
the shoulders. It tugged back, stop- 
ped all their forward progress. and 
Jet them sweep rapidly down the 
Stream and back toward the shore. 


Turning his head he caught a 
glimpse of Nasa sitting calmly in his 
saddie, holding the rope in both hands 
—and laughing. The next instant he 
raw no.more, for the current placed 
a taller rock between him and the 
bank, On that rock the line of the 
lariat caught. hooking the swimmers |. 
sharply in toward the bank. 

Bard reached down through the 
water, pulled out his Colt, and with 
and effort swung himself about. Close 
at hand he could not reach th: rope, 
ond therefore he fired not directly at 
the rope iiseif, but at the edge of the 
sock around which the lariat bent at 
asharp angle, ‘The splash of that bul- 
let from the strong face of *the rock 
sliced the rope like aknife, It snap- 
ped free, and the brave little mustang 
straightened out again for the far 
shore. | 

An instant more Bard swam with 
the revolver poised above the water, 
but he caught no glimpse of Nash; so 
he restored it with some difficulty to 
the holster, and gave all his attention 
and strength to helping the horse 
through the water, swimming with one 
hand and kicking vigorously with his 
feet. A swerving current had caught 
them and was bearing them swiftly 
toward the desired bank. They edged 
shrough, inch by inch, and horse and 
man staggered up the bank and stood 
trembling with fatigue. 

Glancing back, he saw Nash in the 
act of throwing his lariat to the 
ground, wild with anger, and before 
he could understand the meaning of 
this burst of temper over a mere spoil- 
ed lariat, the gun whipped from the 
side of the cowboy, exploded, and 
the little piebald, with ears pricked 
shasply forward as though in vague 
curiosity, crumpled to the ground. 

Nash was galloping furiously up the 
far bank of the Saverack, already safe- 
iy out of range, and speeding toward 
the ford.

“Jimmy,” he said seriously, “order

GREENSBORO 
| AGAIN WINS 


Madison, Ga., January 15.—(Spe- 
cial.)—The fast Greensboro Tiger 
quintet defeated the Madison High 
achool. five here by the seore of 39 to 29. 

The locals played their best ball 
during the initial period, which ended 
13 to 11, in their favor. It was the 
first time in several years that an op- 
pesing team has led the Tiger aggre- 
gation the first period. 

The Greensboro boys came back 
strong in the second half and, by 
their fast pass work and accurate 
goal-tossing, they emerged victors from 
the contest. 

The work of Ben Hume and Bear- 
den was the best for the locals, while 
Few played a hard game at center. 

For Greensboro, the bright light 
of the affair was “Bobby” Bryan at 
guard, who stored 12 of his team’s 
points. Bryan played a jim-dandy 
defensive gaine. 

eCommons and Lewis played a 
fairly good game.

BY ALEXANDER F. JONES, 

United News Staff 

Chicago, January 15.—There was at 
least one saving grace about the eco- 
twomic depression of the year past—it 
certainly did give the overworked busi- 
fess man time to catch up on his golf. 

The United States Golf association 
is completing its annual meeting 
and the executive committee report re- 
veals that 63 new. golf clubs were 
yey to the mage cascciation circle 

uring the year, 

This is a whale ot a report. The 
fiearest' approach to this record in 
any other zat was seventeen. There 
@re now golf. clubs, active and 
allied, in the association, and the grand 
old game is growing in popularity by 
such unprecedented leaps that it is 
little wonder that the meetin 
is exuding enthusiasm and ctions 
are boisterously made that 1922 is go- 
ing to set all records for golf interest. 

Already the association leaders are 
looking forward to the national ama- 
teur at Brookline, Mass., next Septem- 
ber and to the national open at the 
Stokle club here ‘n July. =

As Opponent for Carpentier 


copted” the American light-heavy- 
weight championship, forgetting that 
Levinsky, despite that queer-looking 
knockout at the hands of Carpentier 
in the fall of 1920, was still the own- 
er uf that title, Then Tunney, a vie 
tim of glass knuckles, suddenly came 
ont of the woods where he had been 
working to toughen his hands and 
build up his health. The marine saw 
the opportunity to take thé title and 
he took it with almost ¢astial ease. 


Ahead of Gibbons. 


Thus Tunney has slipped tn before 
Gibbons, for. all of Tommy’s many 
battles in the west and hie long string 
of knockouts over unknown pluhgers. 

Tunney is described as a murder- 
ous puncher, but he is not as rough 
os that. His friends seem to have 

een carried away by the way he 
gio Eddie O’Hare on the ehin for 
a knockout a few weeks ago. O’Hare 
is @ notorious sun-dodger, in the need 
of weight and’ strength, who simply 
wotild not live the athletic life and 
who therefore was asking to bé knock- 
ed cold by the first accurate shooter 
who came his way. 


Assuming that the Carpentier-Le 
vinsky fight was on the square, Car- | 
pear just played with Levinsky and 

eat him to the resin in the fourth 
round. Tunney used everything he 
had to gét a decision over old Bat in 
twelve rounds. 


Fulton Disgraced. 


As a challenger of Jack Dempsey, 
Fred Fulton was utterly disgraced in 
the bout with Madden, a light-heavy, 
85 pounds lighter than Fred. Fulton

CAP ANSON’S 
HANDBOOK. 

Djever hear the one about Cap An- 
son making a handbook? 

Well, sir, Cap didn’t like te have 
his players betting on horse races, 
and some of them liked to take a 
chance once in a while. Cap kicked 
and told them that they were sucker= 
and that they couldn’t beat the gamé, 
but they kept on trying, proving they 
were game, anyhow. 

Bill Dahlen, who was one of the 
greatest shortstops that ever lived, 
came over to me one day and remarked 
that he’d like to know how the faurth 
race came out, and I promised to get 
the result over the wire and toss a 
note out of the wress box to him. 
After that Bill got the result of some 
rave every afternoon in the middle of 
the game. A couple of weeks later 
we were going east and on the train

Augusta, Ga., January 15-—(S 
cial.) —Claud Meadows, negro, ended 
his life shortly before noon today, by 
throwing himself in front of a moving 
street car. The motorman of the 
car, seeing two negroes step from 
the curb, cut off his motor and ap- 
plied his brakes, preparing to stop 
at the station. Meadows, who was 
walking on the west sidewalk, sud- 
denly ran into the street to the track 
and from a stooping position threw 
himself directly in front of the ap- 
proaching ear. The car was brought 
to a stop, but not before the negro 
had been struck and his body horribly 
mangled. 

That the negro intended to destroy 
himself was made evident by a note 
found in the lining of his coat, which 
read, “you will find my body in the 
canal somewhere,” and was signed by 
Claud Meadows, 1315 Eleventh street.

Doubts Clearé® Up. 

‘hat was a very progressive fight 
program in the old Garden Friday 
night when Tunney finally retired old 
Bat Levinsky as the American light- 
heavyweight champ, and_ Bartley 
Madden got a draw with Fred Fulton. 
It eleared up several doubts about the 
heavyweight division. 

Tunney now has a far stronger claim 
to a fight with Carpentier than Tom 


was awful, and though Madden did 
liek him, the vieter’s stock has not 
advanced very much. He is a slug- 
ger, likely to stand. up to anyone ex- 
cept Dempsey but likely also to. be 
outpunched by the clever light-heavier, 

Fulton’s removal leaves very little 
prospective trade for Dempsey. There 
are Bill Brennan, Bob Roper, Bob 
Martin, now injured but hoping to re- 
turn to the ring sometime, and Harry 


Wills, the negro, whose recent per-| ‘

Ixnow Tom Phillips? 

Probably not,. But he may draw 
your attention this year. Phillips’ 
greny pitching with New Orleans and 
n the American association caused 
Clark Griffith, of the Washington ciubs 
to grab him for the coming year. 

Phillips is glad. He wants to get 
revenge on Cleveland fer letting him 
go twice. 

Tom was born in Altoona, Pa., and 
broke into professional ball as a pitch- 
er with the Wilkésbarre club in 1915 
The St. Louis Browns drafted him 
that fall and he hurled three games 
for them before the season ended. 
Won two of them and lost the other, 
1 to 0, to Bert Gallia. 

Then his arm went bloole and he 
| pitched.gemi-pro ball the next season, 
| Changing his style from overhand to 
sidearm. He joined New Orleans in 
the spring of 1918. His work with 
New Orleans caused Manager Lee 
Fohl, of the Indians, to try him out. 
Tom lacked control, however, and 
failed to stick then and when tried 
out again. 

Last year he won twenty-five and 
lost seven games. He hung up a 
no-hit, a one-hit and a three-hit game. 
When he joined the Nationals in the 
closing -days of the campaign he was 
sent against Red Faber and won his 
game, outpitching the Sox star.

That the wholesale grocers will be driven out of business and the 
‘big five’ meat packers given a monopoly in the handling of food 
products if the court decree prohibiting the packers from engaging in 
unrelated lines of business is modified, was asserted by attorneys for 
the National Wholesale Grocers’ association in closing arguments Fri- 
day before the interdepartmental committee appointed by the depart- 
ment of justice. The attorneys summed up the testimony taken at 
hearings before the committee a few weeks ago and prsented argu- 
ments on legal poiats involved. William Breed, of New York city, 
appeared for the National Wholesale Grocers’ association, while former 
Senator Hoke Smith, of Georgia, represented tite Seuthern Wholesale 
Grocers’ association. Arguments in favor of the modification of the 
court decree were made by Vernon Campbell, general manager of the

/ expert in the work of finishing and 


.enables us to give our customers 
the advantage of the lowest price 


ness within the past year, and with 
prospects that the coming year is 
still going to show a wonderful gain, 
the Gate City Mattress company, at 
404 Decatur street, is preparing soon 
to move into much larger and more 
convenient quarters. 

The company lives strictly up to 
its slogan, “every customer must be 
satisfied,” and it is this policy that 
has made this company so strong and 
so popular with the people of this city 
and sectiun. 

Renovating mattresses is one of the 
chief features of this company’s busi- 
ness. When the company was first 
started, a few years ago, it was con- 
fined exclusively to manufacturing 
mattresses and pillows. But it soon 
found a splendid field for renovating 
work, and it turned its attention to 
this line of work. 

“No matter what is the condition of 
a mattress,” said Mr. Moore, the man- 
ager, “we completely rebuilt it by 
reginning and thorouhgly cleaning the 
cotton or hair, putting on new ticking, 
stitching it imperial or roll edge and 
tufting it well, making it even a bet- 
ter mattress than when new. All our 
workers are thoroughly trained and 


otherwise handling our line. 

“Our price for renovating a mat- 
tress is usualy about half the cost 
of a new mattress, where we use 
the best grades of ticking. We car- 
ry at all times a large assortment 
of the newest and best tickings, and 
by having a large wholesale trade 
We buy in large quantities. This 


ssible and also to guarantee the 


selves to meet all the demands made 
upon them, Robert S. Armstrong & 
Brother, who handle complete contrac- 
tors’' equipment, at 676 Marietta | 
street, propose to make the coming 
year the very best in their business 
career. 


The firm deals in new and second- 
hand machinery, machine tools and 
wood-working machinery. It not only 
sells such machinery, but it rents en- 
tire equipment, which has proven a 
great convenience to scores of contrac- 
tors ® 

The firm handles small boilers for 
vulcanizing and pressing, ag well as 
steam engines of all sizes. 

The firm .was organized thirty-three 
years ago by R. 8. & J. P. Armstrong. 
It began business on a small lot on 
Foundry street, later moving to larger 
quarters. Again in 1904 it moved to 
its present location at 676 Marietta 
street, erecting there a large brick 
warehouse. Four years later another 
building was erected, doubling their 
warehouse capacity. 

They now own and operate a shop 
for overhauling equipment, one yard, 
devoted to second-hand pipe, one yard 
equipped with derrick for handling 
heavy equipment. 


st quality of ticking. Our trucks 
call for and deliver work anywhere 


in Atlanta or suburbs, and we de- 
liver the same day received if de- 
sired, if it is possible to do so.” 

The company maintains an abso- 
lutely sanitary work shop, in charge 
of qT, H. Moore, who has had 20 
years’ experience in mattress manu- 
facturing. He employs only experts 
in their line, and it is their satisfac- 
tory work which. is drawing many pa- 
trons to this concern.

which came, to all appearances, from 
outside interests. Some of this selF

Texas, and that here and,there over 
the belt were to be found sections

governor of Texas, prohibiting the 
planting of cotton over still wider

have harbored the pink boll worm 
and further evidence that the boll 
weevil was passing through the win-

The continued easiness of the money

unfavorable in this direction, however, 
was balanced by the further decrease 
in the visible supply of American

Bradstreet’s Weekly 


Bank Clearings 


of four separate statistical surveys— 
each of them country-wi sently 
conducted by the Association of Life 
Insurance Presidents, the inquiries 
involving the actual experience in 1921. 
of the companies as to death clainis, . 
new business, policy loans and invest-: 
ments, Approximately forty million. 
individuals are now life insurance pol- 
icyholders and practically every ham- 
let, village. town and city, as well 
as agricultural and range sections of. 
the country are reflected in these sta- 
tistics. In three of the four inquiries 
the results deal with 90 per cent of 
the life insurance business in the 
United States, while in the other case, ' 
that of death claims, 55 per cent of; 
the total business is represented. 

‘In a word, the combined results of 
these four surveys show that the peo- 
ple of the United States had in 192] 
the healthiest year of their existence: 
that they bought eight and one-half 
billion dollars of new life insurance, 
an amount second in volume only to 
that purchased in 1920; that the pro- 
portion of the accumulated borrowing» 
on their life insurance policies is well 
below the high level reached in 1914 
and that the assets held as reserves 
to mature policies are making a sub- 
stantial growth, contributing further 
to national development. 

“The reduced mortality expefience 
indicates a people well fitted physicat-. 
ly to cope with the new problems: of 
1922, while the other groups of figures 
demonstrate a continuity of thrift and 
stability of purpose under trying con- 
ditions,” is the expressed conclusion 
of the Association of Life Insurance 
Presidents. en

Arrests Foreman 


Of Roller Shops 


A.chase through the crowded streets 
of the city from the Terminal depot. 
to the Terminal hetel. Sunday after- 
noon ended in the arrest of L. F.. 
Osburn, a mechanic, of Griffin, who: 
was brought to the police station at. 
the point of a gun by J. J. Hancox, 
also of Griffin? Osburn cleverly ma- 
— accounts to defraud him, he’ 
said. 

Hancox is a well-to-do manufacturer 
of cotton mill rollers, operating Geor- 
gia Roller shops in Athens, Griffin. 
Social Circle and Atlanta. He claims 
that Osburn, who is foreman of the 
Athens shop. was in charge of the*pay- 
roll and had issued the checks with 
which the employees were paid off. 
For several months, said Hancox. Os- 
burn juggled the records and misap- 
propriated funds to the extent of sev- 
eral hundred dollars. 

On finding that the books were to 
be audited, it is alleged, Osburn 
skipped town, and was not seen until 
Hancox recognized him in the Ter-

SHANTUNG DEBATE 


NEAR SETLEMENT' 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 15.—If the 
Shantung conversations make the 
progress hoped for by conference lead- 
ers during the next two or three days, 
the end of the coming week may see 
all of the issues raised in the Wash-. 
ington negotiations well on the way 
towards solution. 


Confidence that the Shantung prob- d 


lem is nearing a settlement was ap-' 
parent in most quarters tonight, the 
delegates feeling that with the other 
Far Eastern questions in abeyance 
the separate exchanges between the 
Chinese and Japanese over the former 
German leasehold would be pressed 
forward rapidly. Neither’ of the two 
groups dire¢tly interested was pre- 
pared to say that an agreement was 
in sight, but they evidenced a hope 
that fresh instructions from Tokio and 
Pekin expected hourly, might help 
materially to clear up the situation. 

As soon as Shantung is out of the 
way, and perhaps svoner, the con- 
ference Far Eastern-committee will 
resume its consideration of other prob- 
lems of the Orient, with all the dele- 
gates ina position to present their 
views quickly so that the negotiations 
here will not be excessively prolonged. 
On most of the remaining issues the 
delegations already have informed 
themsélves thoroughly regarding the 
views of other groups and the pros- 
pect for an agreement. 

Naval Treaty Ready. 

The naval negotiations also appear 
to be as good as compléted, the trea- 
ty text agreed to by the “big five” 
being regarded as virtually certain to 
meet the approval, successively, of the 
full naval committee and of the con- 
ference itself, sitting in plenary ses- 
sion. Both of these meetings prob- 
ably will be held during the coming 
week, lead®rs planning to set the con- 
ference machinery in motion for final 
approval of the treaty as soon as To- 
kio sends formal approval of the 
article dealing with Pacific fortifi- 
cations. 

Settlement of the Shantung question 
still rests largely in the hands of Ar- 
thur J. Balfour and _ “Secretary 


Hughes, in the opinion of Chinese | 


spokesman. 

Both the Chinese and Japanese del- 
egations were waiting instructions 
from their governments as to the at- 
titude they must take on the Hughes- 
Balfour compromise suggestions de- 
signed to afford a basis for agreement 
on both of the phases of the problem 
which up to now have seemed insolva- 
ble. These phases touch upon the 
method of payment for the Tsingtao- 
T'sinanfu railroad and the nationality 
of the men who will hold the positions 
of traffic manager and chief ac- 
eountant for the railroad after its 
transfer. 

Wait on Instructions. 

Whether the Japanese and Chinese 
delegates can get together this week 
was said to be dependent on the na-

sat the Chinese people be reached. 
ere is no inclination, it was said, 
by the Chinese to accept a compromise 
concerning the question of a loan, and 
China could not agree to any settle- 
ment. which would not assure Ohina 
undivided physical control of the rail- 
way. The delegation, it. was asserted. 
would “stand. pat” on the question of 
management and would insist on a 
Chinese traffic chief and accountant. 


Chinese Only Wait. 


The Chinese declare they are not 
n a position to recede on the ques- 
tions of principle involved, and that 
there is nothing for them to do but 
wait in the hope that Mr. Balfour 
and Secretary Hughes will be able to 
affect a settlement through the Japa- 
nese. Both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Bal- 
fouy, one Chinese official said tonight, 
understand the difficulties the Chinese 
face in the existing situation at home 
with the Chinese people on the verge 
< ayes turmoil over the Shantung 
elay. 

In the meantime, the Chinese and 
Japanese delegations expect to con- 
tinue tomorrow their efforts to clean 
the slate of the collateral questions 
involved in a complete settlement. The 
coal mines adjacent to the railroad 
and more or less tied up with that 
-arageena and the ore fields are the 

rst on the program for tomorrow's 
meeting, and then the only remaining 
questions will be those relating to cer- 
tain cables and the salt fields.
