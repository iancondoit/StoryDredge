SENATOR WATSON 
CLAIMS HARDWICK 
BROKE PROMISES 


Watson Men Good Enough 
to Vote for Him, But Not 
Good Enough to Hold 
Offices, He Says. 


“BETRAYAL OF STATE 


RAILROAD” CHARGED | 


Declares That Hardwick 
and Phillips Are Work- 
ing Together to Dis- 
tribute Federal Plums. 


Another sharp attack on Governor 
Thomas W. Hardwick by his former 
political ally, United States Senator 
Thomas E. Watson, appears in this 
week’s issue of The Columbia Sentinel, 
Senator Watson's newspaper, the sen- 
ator charging that the governor is 
working hand in hand with J. L. Phil- 
lips, chairman of the repubhcan state 
central committee of Georgia, in the 
distribution of federal patronage by 
the republican administration. He 
renews his charge that Governor 
Hardwick “has hot kept his cam- 
Magn promises,” and declares that 
“np. Mes have been broken by Hard- 
wick and he has done things which 
prove that his whole campaign was 
one of premeditated and comprehen- 
sive deception.”’ 

Senator Watson declared that the 
Georgia delegation in congress “does 
not intend to submit to dictation of 
Hardwick and Phillips.” He declares 
that Hardwick is “autocratic” and 
“conceited.” He refers to Phillips as 
a “carpetbagger,” and declares that he 
applied this term to Phillips “face to 
face.” He eaid he ig going to win in 
a fight to prevent the confirmation 
of appointments recently announced | 
for positions as postmaster at Sdvan- 
nah and collector of the port of Na- 
vannah. 

“Betrayal of State Read.” 

The recent sale of deferred West- 
ern and Atlantic railroad rental war- 
rants is characterized by Senator Wat- 


4son as “the most perfidious act since 


the Yazoo fraud.” He refers to the 
sale of the warrants as “betrayal of 
the state road to the Louisville and 
Nashville railroad,@ declaring that 
“half a million of your money has 
been thrown to the lawyers and fis- 
cal agent of the Louisville and Nash- 
ville system.” 

“Your state road is gone,* Senator 
Watson declared. ‘Your executive 
mansion will go next. Your taxes 
have not been lowered. Useless of- 
fices have not been abolished. No 
sane program of constructive legisla- 
tion has been outlined. Useless of- 
fices have been retained and useless 
men” ..t into them. No Watson men 
have been recognized as fit to hold 
positions of real importance. Wat- 
son’s friends were good enough as 
voters, but not good enough to hold 
office.” 

Watson’s Attack. 

Following is the article in ‘Fhe Nen- 
tinel: 

“It is about time that | was say- 
ing something definite about T. W. 
Hardwick and J. L. Phillips. 1 am 
now going to say it. 

“It would not perhaps become me to 
speak of the forlorn condition in which 
Hardwick found himself at the end of 
his term in the senate. 
in Georgia can remember how down 
and out he was. President Wilson 
had not allowed him to dictate in all 
matters of Georgia patronage, and he 


had turned against his president. At 
‘that time J. L. Phillips was not a res- 
ident of Georgia, not a taxpayer, and 
not 1 voter. Neither Hardwick nor 
Phillips voted for Harding. And Phil- 
lips did not vote for Hardwick. If

Friday Meeting Adjourns 
Sine Die, Leaving Situa- 
tion Critical, According 
to Wellington Koo. ~*~ 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Waghington, January 6.—Sine die 
adjournment was taken at the close 
of today’s meeting between the Chi- 
nese and Japanese delegates to the 
Washington conference on the ques- 
tion of Shantung. The conversations 
which have been proceeding intermit- 
tently for several weeks apparently 
came to an end with neither side will- 
ing to make concessions to the other. 

The Chinese and Japanese delegates 
alike were reticent about what oc- 
cufred, but it was said that Welling- 
Aon Koo, for the Chinese, and Am- 
bassador Shidehara, for Japan, re-q 
mained after the meeting to arrange 
for a statement to be made at the 
request of the Chinese who desired 
that a full statement be -made to 
the public. 

After the meeting, Dr. Koo said: 

“The situation is quite critical and 
I don’t want to say anything hastily. 
We will, however, make a statement 
later tenight.”’ 

New Jap Offer. 

Japun made:a new offer inthe 
nature of a concession at today’s 
Shantung meeting, Vice Foreign Min- 
ister Hanihara said tonight. This 
was to make a Japanese railway loan 
for the Shantung railroad for a term 
of fifteen years, with China granted 
the option to redeem the loan at the 
end of five*years, from the date of 
signing the agreement and after six 
months’ natice, : 

Mr. Hanibara said this was Japan’s 
final: suggestion for settlement and 
that it was based on instructions from 
the home government. - He-added that 
the Chinese delegates declined the’ 
offer, but said that there might be 
another meeting. either tomorrow or 
Monday. There was som, \understand-’ 
ing that the Chinese would. consult 
with Mr. Hughes and Mr. Balfour, 
but for the present at least the Japa- 
nese had no intention of asking Mr. 
Balfour and Secretary- Hughes to in- 
tervene. 

The following statement was issued 
by the Chinese and Japanese delega- 
tions, after today’s meeting: 

Statement Issued. 

“The twentieth meeting of the Chi- 
nese and Japanese delegations was held 
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon in the 
governing board room of the Pap- 
American Union building. Discussions 
on the Shantung railway question were 
continued. 

“The Jazanese delegates proposed a. 
railway loan agreement plan for the 


settlement of this question on the basis 
of the terms of ordinary railway loan 
agreements entered into by China with 
various foreign captalists during recent

WEST IS INDICTED 
FOR FOURTH TIME 


True Bill Is Returned in 
Connection With Misap- 
propriation of Insurance 
Money. 


An additional indictment, which 
makes the fourth in the past three 
months, was geturned Friday by the 
Fulton pon grand jury against 
Claude A. West, executive secretary 
to Governors Harris, Dorsey and 
Hardwick. 

The true bill rétuwrned Friday was 
in connection with the alleged misap- 
propriation of. $1,500 insurance mon- 
ey, turned over to West for buildings 
damaged by fire at the state prison 
farm. It is alleged that the money 
was never turned over to the prison 
board. It was the diseovery of this 
alleged defalcation that led to an au- 
dit of the books, which revealed oth- 
er alleged shortages, for which West 
is now under indictment. 

A warrant charging misappropria- 
tion of the $1,500 was sworn out in 
the municipal court, where it was 
later dismissed, but the case has 
never been put before the grand jury 
until Friday, when Judge R. E. Davi- 
son, chairman of the prison commis- 
sion, and H. G. Bell, clerk of that 
body, appeared before the jury and

DISCOVERY OF PISTOL 
AND SHELL RELATED 


Detectives Seeking Shab-

Who Was Seen Near 
Scene Before Shooting. 


After three hours’ consideration. of 
all the known ‘facts in connection 
with the murder early Thursday night 
of J. Russell Compton, secretary and 
treasurer of ° the Nunnal!ly-McCrea 
company, and prominent socially and 
in business circles, the coroner’s jury 
adjourned late Friday afternoon, to 
meet at 10 o’clock Monday morning, 
with as little light shed upon the mys- 
tery as was the case immediately after 
the shooting. 

Coroner Paul Donehoo stated that 
he took this action in order to give 
detectives more time to work, and in 
the hope that there will be important 
developments by that time. 

Detectives were busy at work on the 
ease all Friday, but at the close of 
the day confessed: themselves up 
against a blank wall, with not a clue 
to work upon that promised to lead 
them to the slayer. 

Seek Shabby’ Stranger. 

Detectives. Friday were seeking to 
learn the identity of a man who was 
described as a shabbily-dressed strang- 
er and who is said to have appeared 
at the office of the Nunnally-McCrea 
overall plant ‘Thursday afternoon, 
where he loafed around for several 
minutes. When asked what he want- 
ed, he said he was waiting for his 
wife, but was told that every one 
empleyed at the plant had gone home. 
Nevertheless, it was said, he continued 
to loiter around for several minutes 
before. he finally disappeared. 

Whether or not this man, if found, 
will have any bearing upon the case 
is not. known, but detectives gtated 
they are bending every effort to locate

Love of Pleasure 


Held Responsible 
For Runaway Girls 


Drudgery of Domestic Life 
Blamed by Head of 
Rescue Workers. 


When girls become lost to their 
families, . what happens? 

As a result of the interest_that has 
been created by tne articles on 
“Where the Runaway Girls Bun To” 
by Mrs. Grace Yumiston, in The 
Magazine of The Sunday Constitu- 
tion, Colonel Horace Burton, head of 
the local division of the American 
Rescue Workers, has propounded 
another question along the line of 
why girls leave home. It is a ques- 
tion of morals.’ 

“Do they fall, are they pushed or 
‘do they jump?” 

That is Colonel Burton’s question. 

Various authorities here say that 
kidnaping. by force has been virtually 
eliminated from the causes of the 
disappearance of girls from Atlanta 
and towns in Georgia. They say that 
the girls are found to be susceptible 
to cajolery and often this leads to 
a little notice in some newspaper that 
“Mr. and Mrs. John Smith have re- 
ported to police that daughter, 
Mary Smith, 16 yearagof age, disap- 
peared from home four days ago and 
notices have been sent out to other 
cities in an effort to locate her,” and

CHEMICAL WARFARE

BY*“THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washiggtoh, January 6.—A five- 
power contract to. impose the age old 
penalties for piracy ‘against naval 
commanders who violate accepted laws | 
of naval warfare was. approved to- 
day by the armament committee of the 
Washington ‘conference. It completed 
the Root formula for suppression of 
U-boat terrorism at sea,.and the com- 
mittee then moved forward toward a 
proscriptidn of gas warfare on sea or 
land. 

Again Mr. Root drew the resolution 
to ‘effect the prohibition. Again an 
immediate five-power contract’ to 
abandon gas or other similar chemical 
weapons as beyond the pale of human 
tolerance is proposed to be worked” 
later by world agreement into the 
fabric of international law. And 
again it. seemed certain that under 
American initiative war in future 
would be stripped of others of the 
horrors German ingenuity let loose 
upon the world. 

Italy gave prompt adhesion to the 
anti-gas project as “a real step in 
the path of progress and civilization.” 
Adjournment of the committee pre- 
vented the views of other delegations 
from being presented, but all were 
said to favor the ban on gas war- 
fare. 

Adjourn on Call. 

As .the naval experts shaping tech- 
nical questions in ‘the naval 4imita- 
tion sections of the forthcoming treaty 
still wére wrangling over definitions 
to make clear the agreements they 
have already reached, the armament 
committee adjourned, on call, 


concluding, tonight, but without 
sutcess. They will complete their 
work tomorrew, however, and the full 
committee will be in a position to re- 
sume Monday with the way cleared 
for quick framing of the nayal limita- 
tion treaty and. its omnibus burden 
of allied facts, understandings and 
declarations. 
It was not definitely decided tonight 


to be incorporated in the voluminous 
treaty that will be required to cover 
the naval understandings. it may be 
set forth as a separate product of the 
conference if final approval is given 
the Root prohibitory resolution. - It 
seemed more likely, however, that it 
would go into the general treaty soon 
to be laid before the armament com- 
mittee for final action. 

There was a rearrangement today of 
the Root formula for curbing subma- 
rine operations against merchant 
craft. As the’ proposal come from 
the armament committee, it was divid- 
ed into four separate articles. 

Restates Kules 

The first restated in brief language 
the accepted rules of naval. warfare 
applying to merchant ships, and spe- 
cifically applied these rules to subma- 
rines. The second asked adherence of 
all nations to this reaffirmation of 
international law. ‘The third proposed 
a new principle of international law 
prohibiting use of submarines as com- 
merce destroyers, coupled with an 


adopt this rule as among themselves 
immediately. The fourth was that 
approved today, invoking the rule of 


lating the declared lawsgof war. 

As rearranged later, the piracy rule 
becomes No. 3 and is coupled up with 
Nos. 1 and 2, the purpose being, it 


was explained, to seek world agree- 
ment on that principle as an imme- 
diate extension of the existing laws 
of war. It could not be,applied, it 
was said, as to violations of the new 
proposal to ban submarines entirely 
as commerce raiders until that had 
been accepted by the world. 

With the completion of the agree- 
ment on these four statements through

Company for Losses. 


J 

Disclaiming any authority to pre- 
scribe gas rates for the future to 
make the revenue of the gas company 
sufficiently high to reimburse the 
company for losses suffered in the 
past, the Georgia railroad commission 
Friday filed its answer to the com- 
plainants mage one week ago today 
by the gas company when it sought 
an injunction in the federal court to 
prevent the commission’s gas rate re- 
duction order from taking effect on 
January 1. 

Hearing on the temporary restrain- 
ing order issued at that time by Judge 
Samuel H. Sibley, which -had been 
originally set for Saturday, was posty, 
poned Friday, when it was found that 
the three federal judges required for 
the hearing were not available. The 
new date for the hearing will be de- 
cided Saturday morning at 10 o'clock. 

Reagan Files Answer. 

The answer to the bill of complaint 
was prepared and filed by Judge E. 
J. Reagan, attorney for the railroad 
commission. 

The claim that the method of de- 
termining a “fair value” of the gas 


properties was ynjust and that the 
reduction order was illegal ‘and. ostt-' 
fisedtory, as alleged in the company’s 


commission. 
It was denied that the commission- 
érs had been bound by law to accept 
the exercise on their part of any judg- 
to the value of the property without 
the exercis on thir part of any judg- 
ment or discretion as to the weight 
to be given the evidence, or as to 
the methods used by the engineers. 
The contention of the gas company 
that its “going concern” value was 
$2,000,000 was denied. It was fur- 
ther denied that the “going concern” 
value was a property to be appraised 


separately as a property item. 
Not Entitled to as Much. 

It was set forth that where a. utili- 
ty plant has an absolute monopoly 
on the business it is not entitled to 
have added to its physical property 
value as large a sum as if it had ob- 
tained its business in competition 
vith another utility.

“RESIGNATION UNFAIR,” 
|SAYS MICKY COLLINS 


“T’ll Never Be British 
Subject,” Avers De Va- 


lera, Sticking by “Die 
Hard” Guns. 


Dublin, January 6.—Afgter the wild- 
est day in Irish politics, reaching a 
climax in the resignation of Eamonn 
de Valera from the presidency of the 
“republic’—and an anti-climax in his 
withdrawal of the resignation—the 
dail eireann has agreed to take a vote 
on the question.of ratifying the treaty 
of London at its next session, Satur- 
day. 

De Valera’s resignation, coming as 
a bombshell shortly after the dail eire- 
ann speaker had ruled out the presi- 
dent’s alternative proposals “until a 
v@&e had been taken on the treaty al- 
ready negotiated,” carried with it. the 
resignation of the entire cabinet, the 
proposal to form a new government, 
and the threat to revolt by the ex- 
tremist faction unless the president 
were returned to office by vote of the 
dail. 

De Valera Resigns. 


tive authority,” De Valera declared in 
announcing his resignation. “With 
this goes the ministry. If you re- 
elect us we will adhere to the Sinn 
Fein constitution and do our utmost 
to mak. it impossible fcr England to 
hold this country.” 


There was an immediate wrangle 
over the new phase injected into the 
discussion, in which Arthur Griffith 
accused De Valera of unfnirly seeking 
a vote *’on his own personality.” 

“IT am sick of this wrangling,” De 
Valera retorted. “Whatever happens, 
[ shall go back to private life.” 

“TI will never be a British sub- 
ject,” the president continued. “I am 
for a republic. I demand that the 


°) api shall detide Who Is té:-be the d-. 


ture ruler.” 
“Unfair,” Says Collins. 

Micky Collins, leaping into. the ar- 
gument, presented the claim that De 
Valera’s resignation and a dissolution 
of the government was “unfair and 
out of order.” | 

“There are three or four. bullies 
here,” he said, “who are trying to 
run the dail eireann on Tammany 
hall principles.” 

The dail eireann assembied at 11:30 
in the morning for its secret session, 
after a special committee, consisting 
of four extremists. and four followers 
of the Collins faction, had sought all 
night for some compromise. The re- 
fusal of De Valera to withdraw his 
alternate proposals, which would have 
nullified the treaty signed at London, 
and substitution for his own wording, 
resulted in a continued deadlock, and 
debate in the dail failed to reach any 
solution. 

The furore which followed the pres- 
:dent’s resignation finally ended when 
Arthur Griffith proposed that the dail 
reach a vote on the original treaty at 
the Saturday session, with the pro- 


his action. This De Valera was per- 
suaded to do, and the two factions

Atlanta is rapidly spowilng eastward. 
Druid Hills is one of the future mod.

building fast, and it is almost a city

GOOD ROADS MEETING 


ON IN JACKSONVILLE}: 


_ Jacksonville, January: 6.—Resolu- 
tions looking to the organization of a 
southeastern department of the Ameri- 
can Automobile association were 
adopted by the good roads conference 
here today. The conference accepted 
the resolution drafted by a co ttee 
headed by M. M. Allison, president of 
the Dixie Highway association, which 
embodied a request that the A. A. A. 
take in charge the organization of the 
department and set a date and place 
for meeting at which its consummation 
is to be effected. - 

Charleston, 8. C., and Montgomery, 
Ala., were prominently mentioned as 
likely selections for the next meeting. 

With the adoption of the resolution 
the two-day meeting, attended by rep- 
resentatives from six southeastern 
states, adjourned after having gotten 
under way a movement by which it is 
hoped to build and maintain a sys- 
tem of first-class highways in the va- 
rious states. Broader activity by local 
automobile clubs in looking after the 
motorists’ internsts also is expécted to 
result from the scheme of co-ordinated 
effort. 

Suggestions for the inclusion of Mis- 
sissippi, Virginia and Louisiana in the 
southeastérn department, probably will | 
result in extending of invitations to 
those. states. The matter was left to

CLAIMS HARDWICK 
“BROKE PROMISES” 


Continued from First Page. 


ee 


either Hardwick or Phillips paid any 
1920 taxes in Georgia, 1 would like 
to know the amount and the place 
where paid. 1 invite information on 
that subject. 

“Never did any candidate for office 
make more promises than Hardwick 
made in the campaign of 1920. Never 
did a governor, elected on unequivocal 
promises, go back on them so quickly 
after his inauguration. Hardwick 
worked against the repeal of the in- 
famous tax assessment law, threaten- 
ed to veto a repeal of it, and thus 
killed the repeal bill. Had he not 
promised the people just the reverse of 
this, he could not have been elected. 

“Promises Breken.” 

“Other pledges, equally positive and 
specific, have been broken and Hard- 
wick has done things which prove 
that his whole campaign was one of 
premeditated and comprehensive de- 
ception. 

“His betrayal of our state railroad 
to the Louisville and Nashville. is 
the most perfidious official act since 
the Yazvo fraud. His repeal of the 
act which devoted half the rental of 
the road to the education of the chil- 
dren would seem to prove that he 
had control of the legislature. Half 
a million of your money has been 
thrown to lawyers and to the fiscal 
agent of the L. & N. system. 

“There was no money for free 
elementary school books, but there was 
plenty for the L. & N. banks and for 
the special attorneys who steered the 
sham lawsuit. 

“The sacrifice of the state’s best 
property was considered such a fine 
bit of statesmanship, that a picture 
had to be taken of Hardwick in the 
act of signing the papers. This pic- 
ture ought to be cut out of The 
Atlanta Journal, and saved for future 
inspection. 

“Somebody ought now to photo- 
garph the new broom. It is sweeping, 
fast enough, but it is sweeping away 
your best assets, property which the 
people of Georgia had come to regard 
as sacred. 


“Mansion Will Go Next.” 


“Your state road is gone, your 
executive mansion will go next. Your 
taxes have not been lowered: useless 
offices have not been abolished: no 
sane program of constructive legisla- 
tion has been outlined; useless offices 
have been retained, and useless men 
put into them. No Watson men have 
been recognized as fit to hold places 
of real importance. Watson’s friends 
were good enough as voters, but not 
good enough to hold office. 

“And who is J. L. Phillips? He 
was born in Columbus, but has lived 
in other states, and now lives in 
Pennsylvania. He was a_ profiteer 
during the war and afterwards. selling 


lumber to the government. I invite, 
him to state how much lumber, how 


much the price, how much profi 
and how he disposed of the” it,

“I wonder whether he and Harid-

could put Bishop Keiley’s man, Cur- 
ran, into the Savannah postoffice.

Curran had better be careful how he 
talks about me hereafter, else some 
oi my friends may give him what he

_ < may add, as ja general proposi- 
tion that no Georgia appointment 
can be made over the protest of the 
congressional delegation This mar 
not be good news to Phillips and 
Hardwick, but the statement stands. 
Others can travel the same road that 
Lincoln Johnson did and they are 
going to tfavel it soon. 

Wilson and Hardwick. 

“Woodrow Wilson was autocratic, 
but not more so than Hardwick, Wil- 
son was a@ monument of conceit. but 
not more so-than Bardwick. Wilson 
got his lesson after so long a time, 
and Hardwick may profit by the ex- 


to Phillips, he has cold 
shouldered the life long republicans, 
and catered to pie counter demo- 
crats. He didn’t work, speak, nor 
vote for Harding, and he is against 
these who did. I play straight, or 
not at all. and I have’ no respect 
for those who turn their coats for th. 
sake of an office. 

“There are men in Georgia who 
were republicans when, to be one, 
meant social ostracism and political 
death. These tried men are being 
cast aside, and the patronage beinz 
given to recent converts, to men whw 
Were never known as republicans, also 
never gave a dollar to Harding's cam- 
paign, and who neither spoke, work- 
ed nor voted for him. It isn’t right, 
ana we are not going to stand for it.”

TOSATTERFIELD 


Slayer of Brother-in-Law, 
Who Recently Escaped 
Police Net, Indicted by 
Grand Jury. . 


An indictment charging murder was 
returned by the Fulton county grand 
jury Friday, against J. B. Satter- 
field, of Seattle, Washington, who is 
being sought throughout the country 
as the slayer of R. H. Hart, his 
brother-in-law, in a soft drink and 


'. candy store at the corner of Whitehall 


«=» street and Trinity avenue, 
sx OT. 


December 


Hart was shot and instantly killed 
in the store by Satterfield after the 


latter bad chased him from the Hart 
home on Trinity avenue, a half block 
distant, according to eyewitnesses. 

The slayer fled from the -scene, 
coatless and hagtless, and since then 
no trace of him has been found. Sat- 
terfield, according to witnesses, told 
Hart he had come here for the pur- 
pose of killing him. The tragedy was 
said to have resulted from ill feeling 
on the part of Satterfield over the 
manner in which Hart, as trustee for 
Satterfield’s children, bad handled 
their property. 

Sid Allen, who was mentioned sev- 
eral times in the councilmanic bunco 
probe in eonnection with a_ liquor 
charge brought jointly against him 
and Floyd Woodward, was indicted 
Friday on a charge of assault with 
intent to murder C. D. McCorye, 
whom, it is alleged, he stabbed several 
weeks ago. 


PUBLIC WELFARE ~ 
BOARD WILL HOLD 
MEETING TODAY 


The state board of public welfare 
today will hold its first meeting in 
122 in the office of C. B. Howard, 
chairman, in the Atlanta, National 
Bank building, according to an an- 
nouncement made Friday by Burr 
Blackburn, secretary. Important ques- 
tions relating to the work to be done 
during the year will be discussed. 

Members of the board are C. B. 
Iioward, Atlanta, chairman: Dr. J. G. 
Harrison, Macon; Judge Andrew J. 
Cobb, Athens; Mrs. E. R. Leakin, Sa- 
vannah, and Miss Annette McDonald, 


1sponse of Atlanta and Atlanta’s pro-| 


Cuthbert. 


Association’s Work 


High praise is given to the city of 
Atianta and its progressive business 
men in the annual report of the sec- 
retary of the Georgia’ association, to 
its officers and directors. Following 
is a portion of the secretary’s state- 
ment regarding Atlanta’s Co-operation : 

“Frankness compels the statement 
that the Georgia association could not 
have survived the financial storm of 
the past year but for the splendid re- 


gressive business men. This re- 
sponse continued from che inception 
of the campaign last year down 
through the present membership cam- 
paign, has enabled the Georgia as- 
sociation to carry on its national ad- 
vertising and to perfect the machin- 
ery of its working plans and brought 
it to its present position of great 
potential usefulness to the state of 
Georgia. 

“This response from Atlanta, both 
from its mayor and its city council, 
who appropriated funds for the work 
of the association, and from its pro- 
gressive business men, is all the more 
praiseworthy because of the fact that 
Atlanta’s interest in bringing farm 
settlers to the rural communities of 
Georgia is only an indirect interest. 

“Atlanta, with its big manufactur- 
ers and distributing houses and retail 
stores, which are patronized by the 
people from all parts of Georgia, has 
proved that she has a vision of a 
greater Atlanta only through a great- 
er Georgia, and she has proved that 
she has a spirit that is not only an 
Atlanta spirit, but a Georgia spirit. 

“The plans for developing and set- 
tling Georgia pursued by the Geor- 
gia association, if given continued 
moral and financial support of other 
cities in the state comparable with 
that given by Atlanta, can surely 
bring hundreds of prosperous farm- 
ers here from every section of the 
United States and attract millions of 
dollars of investments in industrial 
activities.” 

Other, counties mentioned in the sec- 
retary’s report which have raised the 
quotas entitling them to membership, 
and who are being placed in contact 
with the inquiries received for Geor- 
gia farms in response to the associa- 
tion’s advertising. were: McIntosh, 
Wayne, Ware. Turner, Clark, Polk 
and Murray.

Found Guilty of Slaying. 

Lonnie Boyette in His 
Own Home on Christ- 
mas Day. 


Waycross, Ga., January 6.—(Spe- | 
cial.)—Ivey Watson, on trial for ek 


murder of Lonnie Boyette at the lat- 
ter’s home near Patterson on Christ- 
mas day, was found guilty by a jury 
in the Pierce county superior court 
today. ‘The jury returned a recom- 
mendation for mercy, and Watson was 
sentenced to life imprisonment by | 
Judge Strange. 

During the course of the trial it 
was developed that Boyette was at- 
tempting to get Watson to leave his 
home when the murder occurred. Wat- 
son had made two separate attempts | 
to shoot Boyette’s wife before the pis , 
tol wa& finally turned on Boyette. 

Solicitor Allen B. Spence, of this 
city, and 8S. F. Memory, of Black- | 
shear, represented the state. and Judge 
J. R. Thomas represented the defend- 
ant. { 

The jury deliberated about three 
hours before reaching a decision.

pretty fourteen-year-old wife of a 
world-war hero, this afterajoon smiled 
demurely ‘in the court room here and

And the judge, who is a kind beart- 
ed man, smiled, too; disuilissed

ing his wife, and contempt proceed- 
ings against Eugene Crawley, the 
angry uncle who, Thursday appeared

Rome, Ga., January 6.—(Special.)

filed in the courts of this section ap- 
peared in Chattooge county today, 
when a boarding house keeper asked 
atithority for holding a baby as col- 
lateral for a bill due by the father. 

The complainant charges that the 
father promised the landlady that she 
could keep the child until his bill was 
paid, and that now he is attempting 
to recover it,-hence she seeks an in- 
junction against him. ‘The parents 
of the child are divorced. °

interest, and friends of 
chipped the necessary fund to make 
the necessary borings to disclose 
whether or not there was oil present 
in paying quantity. 

ese borings have progressed to 
the point where there is no oil at hand 
in commercial quantities and the work 
has been stopped and there will be no 
further test so far as the “Y” is 
concerned. .Experts assert, however. 
that the development at the new “Y”

Comptroller General W. A. Wright 
and County Tax Collector W..8. Rich- 
ardson were temporarily enjoined from 
collecting an occupational tax of $75 
from retail cigar dealers by Judge 
John T, Pendleton in Fuiton superior 
court Friday, upon petition of J.’ N. 
Hirsch and other cigar déalers. 
Hearing on the petition was set fur 
January 14. | 

The petition alleges that the. law

unconstitutional, in that it violates 
several sectionsgof the constitution of 
the state of Georgia. 

Tue plaintiffs are represented by 
Hooper Alexander, former United 
States district attorney for the nortb-

will be represented by Attorney-Gen-

MEMORIAL SERVICES 
AT ROOSEVELT GRAVE 


Oyster Bay, N. Y., January, 6.— 
The Roosevelt pilgrimage, an aSsocia- 
tion of advisors and close friends of 
the former president, journeyed here 
today to commemorate the third an- 
niversary of the death of the former 
president. 

At the grave, Dr. Lyman Abott, 
chairman of the association, intro- 
duced James R. Garfield, Roosevelt’s 
secretary of commerce and labor, who 
read the address delivered by the 
colonel before the Nobel prize com- 
mittee in Christiania in 1910, inelud- 
ing the passage: 

“It would be, a master stroke if 
those great powers honestly bent on 
peace would form a league of peace, 
not only to keep the peace among 
themselves, but to prevent, by force, 
if necessary, its being broken by oth- 
ers. The supreme difficulty in con- 
nection with developing the peace 
work of the Hague arises from the 
lack of any executive power, of any 
police power to enforce the decrees 
of the court.” 

Thomas Robbins, of Philadelphia, 
placed a wreath on the grave. The 
association then went to  Satamore 
Hill. where they were entertained at 
luncheon by Mrs. Roosevelt. 


TARLET 
UNVEILED. 

New York, January -6.—Another 
tribute to the memory of the late 
Theodore Roosevelt was paid today, 
on the third anniversary of his death, 
when hig sister, Mrs. Douglas Robin- 
son, unveiled a tablet near the desk 
he occupied as commissioner in the 
old police headquarters. 

The ceremony was attended by 
many former friends and associates of 
Colonel Roosevelt, Mayor Hylan, Com- 
missioner Enright and General A. D. 
Andrews spoke in tribute to the for- 
mer president.

terest in the injunction directed at

Is Official Word 


BY JOHN GLEISSNER. 
United News Staff Correspendent 

Washington, January 6.—The word 
has been passed out officially that Pres- 
ident Harding holds Senator Newberry 
in very high esteem. 

This eliminates any doubt that the 
republican administration spokesman 
would be expected to support the cause 
of Newberry in his fight to retain his 
seat in the United States senate, 

In addition to the statement at the 
white house as to Harding’s personal es- 
timate of Newberry, there is a persist- 
ent report at the capitol that Harding 
has dispatched a letter to one of the 
administration senators for use, if nec- 
essary, in the Newberry fight. It 
proved impossible to confirm this re- 
port, learn the name of the senator 
to whom the letter is alleged to have 
been addressed, or ascertain its sub- 


} Stance. 


Not to Act. 

It is officially stated, however, to be 
the president’s wishes that he be not 
made a participant in the proceedings 
around Newberry’s fight. Se far as ac- 
tion on the case is concerned, the presi- 
dent feels it is a question entirely up 
to the senate membership, but hé does 
not object to having it known that he 
regards Newberry highly. 

The fight to oust Newberry began in 
the senate Friday afternoon with an 
attack*by Senator Caraway, of Arkan- 
sas, which early developed into a heat: 
ed exchange with Senator Spencer. 
of Missouri, chairman of the committee 
which investigated the election. 

Newberry was not in the chamber. 
Galleries were crowded, with fewer 
women present than ordinarily attend. 
There was a liberal atténdance of sen- 
ators at the outset, but they gradually 
deserted the chamber during the after- 
noon, and only a handful were present 
to hear a speech by Senator Heflin. 
democrat, of Alabama. 

Close Vote Expected. 


Lines were tightly drawn as the de- 
bate opened. Leaders insisted New- 
berry will be upheld by a safe majority, 
but uncertainty persisted as to how a 
number of votes will be cast, and it 
was indicated the outcome will be 
close. 

Caraway asked Senator Curtis, re- 
publican whip, if it were true that 
Newberry was to speak on Monday, 
and was referred by Curtis to Spen- 
cer. 

“It is true that Senator Newberry 
expects to come here Monday and 
make a stataement,” replied Spencer. 
“Tt is also true that Senator New- 
herry’s family and friends have felt 
his health would suffer if he did, and 
that he had no right to subject him- 
self to the ordeal of coming here to 
submit to an attack by his enemies.” 

“Attack an Atrocity.” 

Caraway wanted to know why Spen- 
cer had objected to the request that 
the limitation of an hour on debate 
be not imposed on Newberry. 

“Because I felt that the motive 
for that move on the part of the 
minority was one of antipathy and 
antagonism,” replied Spencer. 

He added that he considered the 
“attack, abuse and villification” of 
Newberry by the democrats “brutal 
and an atrocity.” o 

Caraway questioned Spencer about 
conversations the latter had with 
Newberry, and declared that Spencer, 
as chairman of the investigating com- 
mittee, had no right to confer with 
the man under investigation. Spen- 


cer said he had as much right to 
confer with Newberry as other sen- 
ators did to confer with “Henry 
Ford’s counsel, who now sits in the 
gallery.” 

Long Argument. 

The Arkansas senator then launch- 
ed into a long argument designed to 
show that Newberry is not entitled 
to hold his seat. 

Senator Williams, democrat, of Mis- 
sissippi, expressed the hope that New- 
berry would permit himself to be 
questioned. 

“The Newberry family is an hon- 
orable one, and the family of the sen- 
ator’s wife is an honorgble one,” said 
Williams. “I should be sorry indeed 
if the so-called junior senator from 
Michigan did not give me some rea- 
son to conclude that he had not dis- 
graced two distinguished families.”

Cases of Germans 


a 


Paris, January 6.—(By the Associ- 
ated Press.)—Belief that the allies 
will abandon further proceedings 
against German military leaders on 
charges of instigating the world war 
was expressed in French political 
circles today. Occasion for such com- 
ment was furnished by the meeting 
of the war guilt commission of the 
league of nations at the Quay d’Orsay 
this afternoon.

Florida Senator Accuses 
Oregon Member of 
Blocking Lower Lumber 
Rates for South. 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Bureau, 

Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, January 6.—( By 
Constitution Leased Wire.)—Senator 
Park Trammell, of Florida, has pre- 
cipitated a national sensation in his 


charge, on the floor of the senate, 
that C. B. Atchison, a member. of 
the interstate commerce commission, 
appointed from Oregon, had *‘used his 
good offices to obtain a decrease of 
16 per cent in lumber rates from the 
west and central] west and opposed 
a reduction in lumber rates in the 
south.” 

The Florida senator was making 4 
vigorous defense of his bill, just in- 
troduced, providing that members of 
the commission shall be appointed 
from geographical sections of the 
country which would give the South 
Atlantic and also the Gulf states one 
each of the eleven members. 

The question is one of the keenest 
possible interest to the south, and 
there is every reason to believe the 
bill of the Florida senator and his 
speech support it, will not only 
make this a national issue, but be- 
come a factor in geographical ratings 
in the future. 

Senator Trammell spoke in part as 
follows: 

Speech of Trammell. 


“For a long time I have hoped that 
the chief executive of the nation 
would distribute the appointments of 
the members of the interstate com- 
mission so as to have, as nearly as 
possible, the different geographical 
sections of the country represented 
on the commission, but in view of the 
fact that it does not seem to be the 
policy of the president to appoint the 
membership of this commission from 
different sections, and in some in- 
stances, or at least in one instance, 
there are two members’ from one 
state, I have deemed it proper and my 
duty to introduce a bill requiring that 
the commissioners snall be appointed 
from different sections of the United 
States. | 

“Take the great southern part of 
our country. It has no representa- 
tion ‘upon the commission. It seems 
that from environment and from close 
contact with the transportation prob- 
lems of different sections, members 
apparently are more or less influ- 
enced at times by their more familiar 
knowledge of, the interests, as far as 
they are involved in transportation. 
of the sections from which they are 
appointed. Not that they mmn to 
discriminate, but that they are bet- 
ter posted upon and unconsciously 
more in sympathy probablv with the 
industries of the territory from which 
they come. Take the. personnel of the 
present commission, and let us see 
where they are from. 

Present Personnel. 

“We find that Mr. Hall is from 
Colorado; Mrs. Aitchison is from Ore- 
gon; Mr. Eastman is from Massa- 
chusetts; Mr. Potter is from 
York; Mr. Daniels is from New Jer- 
sey; Mr. McCord is from Kentucky; 
Mr. Campbell is from Washington; 
Mr. Meyer is from Wisconsin; Mr. 
Lewis is from Indiana; Mr. Cox is 
from New Jersey, and Mr. Esch is 
from Wisconsin. We have upon-this 
commission two members from the 
state of New Jersey. There are onty 
11 members, with our 48 states and 
yet New Jersey has two members 
upon that commission. Also*two mem 
bers are from Wisconsin. 

“IT don’t mean that the members 
of the commission would not feel dis- 
posed to represent the U. 8S. in gen- 
eral: but unquestionably the commis- 
sioners, in dealing with problems 
with which they are more familiar, 
are in a better position to pass upon 
them and make equitable adjustments 
than if they have only the informa- 
tion that is brought to them when 
the particular rate question is pend- 
ing. 

Recently there has come before the 
interstate commerce commissioner, for- 
mally and informalty, the question of 
lumber rates. Mr. Aitchison, who is 
from Oregon, as I understand upon 
reliable authority, was heartily in 
sympathy with the idea of the rail- 
roads making a voluntary reduction of 
about 16 per cent in the rates on lum- 
ber from the west to the central west 
and the east; but when the question 
| of a reduction of freight rates upon 
lumber from the southern states was 
raised, Mr. Aitchison, instead_of try- 
ing to assist in.bringing about a vol- 
untary reduction or a forced reduc- 
tion, if you please, if necessary, in 
freight rates, balked in every way 
possible, I am informed, the plan to 
secure a reduction in the rates upon 
lumber shipped from the south. 

Charges Favoritism. 

“Whether Mr. Aitchison was actu- 
lated consciously or unconsciously in 
this matter, I do not know, but com- 
ing from the great lumber section of 
the west he has at least contributed 
his good offices, I am informed, to 
obtain a reduction of 16 per ‘cent for 
the lumbermen of the west, and, on 
the other hand, has used his good 
offices to defeat, or at least delay, a 
| reduction of lumber rates on lumber 
| shipped from the south. , 
| “What is the result? ‘he: exten- 
| sive lumber industry of my state and 
| of other southern states is threat- 
‘ened with paralysis, because the great

at iower prices than the lumbermen 
of the south, practitally only one-third 
of the distance away, will be able to 
obtain for their lumber—for instance, 
in New York and territory in that 
vicinity. ‘This is a concrete case il- 
lustrating the fact that the member- 
ship of the interstate commerce com- 
mission should not be centralized in 
any one particular section of the 
country. * 
Want Fair Deal. 

“All we want is a fair deal. All we 
want is for all sections of the country 
to be properly represented upon the 
commission, and that is what 1 am 
contending for. ‘The great southern 
part of the nation has only one mem- 
ber who is designated even as com- 
ing from the south—Mr. McChord. 
Mr. McChord comes from Louisville, 
Ky., on the Ohio river. If the local 
viewpoint, if the local knowledge gain- 
ed by a man’s residence and his citi- 
zenship and his connection with the 
enterprises of any particular locality 
has any influence whatever, then the 
south is without representation upon 
the interstate commerce commission.” 

After a heated colloquy between 
several senators who rushed to the 
rescue of the ‘president’s” appoint- 
ments, the Florida senator continued: 

“Mr. President, the senator from 
Oregon has stated that the rates from 
the west are low because of water 
competition. I am sure the senator is 
sufficiently familiar with his geogra- 
phy to know that Florida, Georgia, 
South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, 
Mississippi and a number of the lum- 
ber ,roducing states in the south are 
also coast states, and that they should 
participate in whatever competition 
we gy have on account of water 
rates. They are not doing so, however. 
They are not doing so because the 
I. C.C. hasn’t shown that zealousy to- 
ward them and in behalf of getting 
a reduction of lumber rates from the 
south that has been true as to the fix- 
ing of railroad rates from the west.” 


ENGINEERS TO STUDY 
NEW OFFER ON PLANT 


Washington, January t.—The pro- 
posal for completion and lease of the 
government’s nitrate and water power 
plants at Muscle Shoals, Ala., received 
from Frederick E Engstrum, presi- 
dent of the Newpor& Ship Building 


company, of Wilmington, N. C., was 
referred today by Secretary Weeks to 


{war department engineers for careful 
‘analysis and report. 


Brigadier-Gen- 
eral Taylor, assistant chief of army 
engineers, was directed to make a 
thorough study of the offer and to 
give the secretary as soon as possible 
his estimate of the bid. 
Marion Butler, former United 
States senator from North Carolina, 
acting as legal adviser to Mr. Eng- 
strum, will be given a hearing at a 
date to be fixed by the secretary im- 
mediately upon receipt of General 
Taylor’s report. At/that time, Mr. 
Butler said today, Mr. Engstrum and 
his associatés in the enterprise will 
appear to give additional information 
regarding their proposal. 
Commenting on the Kngstrum offer 


today, war department officials said | 


Secretary Weeks most desired an offer 
for the outright purchase of the Mus- 
cle Shoals properties, as they stand, 
without requiring an additional ap- 
propriation by congress for the com- 
pletion of the project and without 
assumption on the part of the govern- 
ment of responsibility for its future 
management. — 

One official declared it would be 
no task for the war department to 
get bids for ‘he completion of ‘the 
project, provided congress would au- 
thoriz: the expenditure of money for 
that purpose, and that the Engstrum 
proposal appeared from preliminary 
study to be an indirect bid for sucu 
a contract. 

The war department today offered 
to sell 3,247,000 pounds of armonium 
nitrate manufactured at Muscle Shoals 
during the war. Sealed bids for its 
purchase, it was anonunced, would be 
received by the Philadelphia district 
ordnance salvage board not later than 
noon, January 23, but no guarantee 
would be given as to analysis or con® 
dition of the material which has been 
in storage about three years, 


DIFFERENT STORIES 
OF KILLING TOLD 


Austin, Texas, January 6.—Two 
different stories of the shooting of 
Peeler Clayton, chauffeur, near the 
Ku Klux Klan hall on the night of 
December 15, were given by witnesses 


today at the examining trial of Barney 
Blunt and Olney Childress, charged 
with assault to murder. 

In testimony directly opposite to 
that given by M. A. Hudler, the first 
witness, Mrs. Ben Walker, who lives 
across the street from the hall, de- 
clared that no shots were fired from 
an automobile in which Clayton, Blunt 
and’ Childress were riding, the firing, 
she declared, coming from an alley. 

After about: eight shots had been 
fired, she testified, the men in the 
alley went into the hall, from whence 
immediately issued the sound of ap- 
plause and stamping of feet. 

Hudler, who testified he saw Police- 
man KE. L. Young, Patrolman J. L. 
McNeil, Basset Miles, féderal prohibi- 
tion agent, and W. E. Mayberry, cus- 
todian at Camp Mabray, in the alley 
where the shooting occurred, asserted 
the first shots were fired from the au- 
tomobile and that the firing was re- 
turned. Young, McNeil, Miles and 
Mayberry are under charges of mur- 
der in connection with Clayton’s death. 


The soldiers’ bonus bill, it is said, 
will be passed by congress within the 
(next ninety days.

tile above*ground, but with a base- 
ment. 

The petitioner sets forth that it is 
proposed to operate the plant entirely 
by electric power, and that there will 
be nothing in connection with the op- 
eration of same that may constitute a 
nuisance.

this amount $1,324.19 goes to the pub- 
lic school fund. The company is also 
assessed for taxes for the city of De- 
caturf in the sum of $3,750.11. But 
this sum, totalling $18,800.56 is not 
all the money the company puxs out in 
taxes in DeKalb. The company is as- 
sessed for taxes in Clarkstoh and Stone | 
Mountain. The state also collects in 
taxes for the railway $23,692.50, and

226.23, a total of $36,918.73, and a to- 
tal of $55,718.84 for DeKalb county

to be added the taxes of all other coun- 
ties and municipalities. 


Best Soil for Politicians. 

A line drawn north and_ south 
through Ingleside, about a mile and a 
half. below Decatur, will put about 
three-fourths of the county’s wealth 
to the west. but practically all the poli- 
ticians to the east. In fact. politicians 
will hardly sprout west of that line.

office in Decatur so long that it is 
not remembered where he came from

in a speech before the Civitan club 
in the Kimball house at 1 o’clock yes- 
terday, Councilman Edgar Watkins re- 
plied to attacks by opponents of his 


‘proposed new charter plan, and chal- 


lenged them to submit their own plan 
und let the people choose between the 
two. 

“Let the friends of the Atlanta plan 
perfect it in detail, and let its op- 
ponents, by March 1, prepare and per- 
fect their plan,’ he said. “Then let 
both plans be printed and go to the 
people, who can choose the one they 


want. -If the opponents of the Atlanta 
plan are sincere, they will either let 


that charter go before the people or | can prevent such a crime even if a 
' board of aldermen could be found will- 


they will present another plan and let 
both be voted on. ‘Che gentlemen in 
vpposition should become less vocal 
ve. write and submit their plan of 
the revised charter they say is needed.” 
Mr. Watkins asserted chat “it is 
ninusing to watch some of the ogo: 
neuts of the Atlanta plan. They 
say, as all int lligent people know, 
that we need a new charter, but they 


object to all charters offered and never | 


offer one themselves.” 
Summary Is Given. 

In opening his talk to the Civitans 
the councilman gave a brief summary 
of the salient new points of bis char- 
ler and declared that the criticisms 
directea at it have indicated either 
that the critic had not read the char- 
ter or could not comprehend it. 

Replying to specific attacks that 
the Atlanta plan would vest too much 
nuthority in one official, Mr. Watkins 
stated: Administrative authority 
is, a8 it should’ be, — centered 
in one man, but he can 
not be a czar. He gets bis appoint- 
ment from the people’s representatives 
und can be removed by such represen- 
tatives. If the representatives fail in 
their duty, they can be removed by 
the people. The chief of administra- 
tion not only is subject to removal but 
he can not spend a penny without be- 


ing authorized by ordinance, and then | 


he must*show fhe controller that the 
expenditure is proper. 
“Now Atlanta has a commisston

‘gia is expected within the next ten 


From a 
tem the most inefficient that could be 
devised, it is proposed to go to t 
kind ot efficiency whitch all intelli- 
gent men adopt in their own affairs.” 

The speaker asserted that since, 
1874, when Atlanta’s present charter 
was adopted, it had been amended 27 
different times, each time without con- 
sulting the people. “If the Atlanta 
plan needs amending,” he said “the 
people are given the right, which some 
councilmen now propose to deny them, 
to initiate the amendments. they 
want.” 

All Meetings Public. 

He stated the light of full publicity 
would always be on the government 
and its operation under t¥e new char- 
ter, which provides that all meetings 
of the board of aldermen must be pub- 
lic and that monthly and annual re- 
ports must be made and the annual re- 
port printed. 

Mr. Watkins declared also, that 
“never again, if this charter is adopt- 
ed, will the city’s streets. be given 
away to any public utility. The people 


ing to disregard their duty.” 

The Civitans had as special guests 
at the luncheon and meeting Irving S. 
Watts, chief of the police department 
of Portland, Me.; United States Dep- 
uty Collector Simeon Harriman and 
H. F. Pierce, an attache of the de- 
partment, also of that city. © Police

Price of Gasoline 
In Atlanta Expected 
To Be Reduced Soon 


Reduction in the retail pricé of gaso- 
lene in Atlanta and the rest of Geor- 


days, according to Officials of the 
Texas company. Reductions of two 
cents per gallon became effective Fri- 
day in Louisiana and Tennessee cities. 
“Atlanta reductions usually follow 
cuts in Memphis: about one week,” 
declared a Teaxs company official Fri- 
day. Customarily, a reduction in the 
gasoline price here by the Texas com- 
pany would be followed by a similar 
reduction by other local companies. 
Gasoline now sells here for 26 cents 
a gallon, while in Memphis the price

~ OF MASONS’ ANNUITY: 


; 


Joseph A. Morris, state organizer 
for the Masons’ Annuity, working 
under direction of R. E. Edwards, su- 
preme secretary, in a statement giv- 
en out Friday following the filing of 
a petition of 23 beneficiaries of the 
annuity in Fulton superior court, in 
which a receiver for the company was 
asked, declared that the company is 
solvent and no receivership has been 
granted. 

‘Receivership for the supreme 
lodge of the Masons’ Annuity and 
an injunction against the order dis- 
posing of any -f its property and as- 
sets were asked in the suit by 23 
beneficiaries of the organization, who 
allege the order is insolvent and has 
announced its intention of stopping 
the payment of benefits April 1, 1922. 
Judge George L. Bell signed a tem- 
porary resiraining order on the dis- 
posal of the assets and set January 
30 as the date for determination of 
whether a receiver should be ap- 
pointed. 

“Rates Are Inadequate.” 

Mr. Williams’ statement follows: 

“In 1915 the reorganization of the 
Masons’ Annuity took place. It was 
found that the rates for class B an- 
nuities were inadequate. The Ma- 
sons’ Annuity set aside all the funds 
of the corporation belonging to this 
class for the payment of these annui- 
ties and established a new class} to 
which now all living members belong, 
who pay upon a new and adequate 
rate. 

“The order received in dues from 
the class B annuities $74,761.22, and, 
including payments to be made dur- 
ing the present quarter, will have 
paid out to them $1,235,695.41. There 
are only 350 beneficiaries in this class 
B. That the order has treated them 
fairly is apparent from the fact that 
if they had paid the same amount of 
premiums in any of the old line com- 
panies they would have received in- 
surance in the amount of only $523. 
917, as against the $1,235,695.41, 
which has already been paid to them. 

“The payments made to these class 
B annuities has practically exhausted 
the fund set aside for their benefit 
at the time of the reorganization. 
Therefore, the charge that the order 
is unable to meet its obligations re- 


is only 231-2 cents.

ing more than $1,000,000 of surplus |; 
invested in securities of the highest | 
class.” 

The petitioners allege in their plea | 
that the Masons’ Annuity -.has estab- 
lished since their claims accrued a 
new insurance contract for new busi- | 
ness called “Class A,” and that the} 
company is using for other purposes | 
assets which should go toward keep- | 
ing up the class B payments, and |! 
that this should be enjoined. 

The petitioners attach as an ex- 
hibit to their petition an alleged 
copy of a letter signed by Dan A. 
Greene, of Birmingham, president of 
the Masons’ Annuity, and alleged to 
have been sent to the 357 “class B” 
policyholders announcing that “after 
April, 1921, no further benefits are | 
to be paid to policypolders whose 
claims accrued prior to 1915, as the 
insured persons up to that time did 
not pay into the company’s treasury 
enough dues to keep the fund for this | 
class of beneficiaries goiug.”

OF BANK QUARTER 


Reserve Board Asked for 
‘Complete Information on 
Building Costs by Geor- 
gia Senator. 


_— 


a, 

BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Bureau, 

Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, January 0.—(By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.)—In prepar- 
ing information for the support of 
his amendment in the senate provid- 
ing that no buildings shall hereafter 
be erected by the Federal Reserve 
banks without consent of congress, 
Senator Harris, of Georgia, today 
wrote the following Ictter to the fed- 
eral reserve board: 

“I note in press dispatches of this 
date that your board is reported to 
have stopped all plans for your pro- 
gram of building reserve bank houses 
in Various cities in view of an amend- 
ment offered by me to bili 8-226, 
providing that congress shal. give au- 
thority hereafter before buildings are 
constructed. 

“I would thank you to let me have 
the followizg information: 


‘ History of Costs. 


“1. The amount of cost for each 
building already completed; how the 
contracts were given; whether com- 
petitive bids were asked, or whether 
any work was done on the cost plus 
basis. 

“2. The amount of rent paid for 

buildings in each place where the new 
buildings were constructed. 
_ “3. The expected cost of each build- 
ing now under construction, or for 
which plans have been made, or con- 
tracts let, or for buildings contem- 
plated. 

“4. The amount of cost of furni- 
ture and fixtures for each of the 
buildings already completed, and infor- 
mation as to how contracts for such 
furniture and fixtures were given— 
that is, if competitive bids, or other- 
wise, 


Number of Employees. 

“Od. The cost of building occupied 
and the amount of rent being paid 
for each building now being rented, 
or otherwise occupied, by the sys- 
tem which buiddings are not owned 
by the banks and the number of 
employees in each of these rented 
buildings. In this connection [I desire 
to know the amount of rent for build- 
ings now occupied in the cities of St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, Cincinnati. Balti- 
more, Nashville, Jacksonville, Detroit 
Louisville, Denver, Oklahoma City 
and Salt Lake City, as these are men- 
tioned in the press dispatches referred 
to, as being places where you have 
oe Up. senae. 

“6. e number r 
ey bane of employees in 

Bre I st this in 
nection with pending legislation j 
the senate, I shall Poems ag the 
earliest attention possible.” 

Yesterday it was announced by Gov- 


formation in con- 


| 


federal shall 
huve no authority hereafter to enter 
into any contract or contracts for the 


erection of any building vf any kind | 
thorize the erec. | 


or cter, or to au 
tion of any building, without the con- 
sent of congress having previously 
been given therefor in express terms.” 

Senator Harris stated that he first 
considered the neecssity of such leg- 
| islation when it became known that 


for the construction of the Reserve 
Bank building in New York, which 
the senator said, was more than all 
the money spent by the government 
for several years on public buildings 
throughout the country. In connec- 
tion with his fight for the amend- 
ment the Georgian said he would also 
press his proposal to have a uniform 
discount rate for che reserve banks 
in all districts, as the rates in the 
south and west were now higher than 
in the east. 


BYRNES ALSO 
PLANS BILL. 


Washington, January 6—An at- 
tack was made today in the house by 
Representative Byrnes, democrat, 
South Carolina, on the federal reserve 
board, which, he said, planned to con- 
Struct, at a cost of $25,000,000, an 
elaborate headquarters in New York 
city, with a gymnasium, club, audi- 
— and other “extravagant fea- 
ures,” 


_ “Such a building will do more to 
incite bolshevism than anything else,” 
Mr. Byrnes declared, adding that he 
intended to introduce a bill requiring 
the federal reserve Doard to submit 
all estimates for expenditures to con- 
sress through the budget bureau, so 
there would be a check on its spend- 
ings. 

Mr. Byrnes stressed the point that 
the erection of the building would be 
undertaken at a time when congress, 
in the interests of economy, denying 
various needed public buildings, which 
a = aggregate would cost $40,000.- 


Representative Parker, republican, 
New York, asserted that money for 
construction of the New York build- 
ing would not be met through taxes 
on the public, but from earnings of the 
federal reserve system. 


DELAYED NUPTIALS 
NOW CALLED OFF 


Los Angeles, Cal., January 6.—The 
marriage of John R. Cudahy, son of 
the late John Cudahy, pioneer Chicago

| National Authority on Art 


Will Speak in Atlanta 


Mrs. Ulric 8. Atkinson, chairman 


, of fine arts for the Georgia Federa- 
ation of Women’s Clubs, 
hat Mrs. Rose V. S. Berry, chairman 


announces 


f fine arts for the General Federa- 


3 jons of Women’s Clubs, will be a dis- 


guished visitor in Atlanta’on Fri- 
y of next week, and at a subscrip- 
2 luncheon at the Capital City 
will address a body of Atlanta 
3 and women rejwesentatives of 
ca@ leading civic, artistic and feder- 
ated club interests in Atlanta. 
_Mrs. Berry is an authority on fine 
arts who has @ national recognition. 
She is one of the foremost lecturers in 
the country on art themes, and in her 
own section, the far west, she has 
taken prominent part in that stimu- 
lation of art interest, which is making 
the west a formidable rival to New 
York, Boston and Philadelphia, in the 
promotion of the cause of fine arts 
and of popular interest in them. 


Organizations Represented. 

The City Federation of Women’s 
Clubs, Mrs. Albert Thornton, presi- 
dent, will take a leading part in the 
stimulation of interest in Mrs. Ber- 
ry s coming. e following organiza- 
tions will have representation at the 
Juncheon in her honor; the Atlanta 
Art association; the art department 
of the Woman’s club; the Drama lea- 
gre: the Musie Study club; the City 

lanning commission; the City Art 
commission; the American  Archi- 
tects’ association, and the City Feder- 
ation of Women’s Clubs. 

Mrs. Atkizson has invited Mrs. 
James E, Hays, president of the Geor- 
gia Federation of Women’s Clubs, and 
chairman of fine arts of the. twelve 
district federations, to be present. 

It is probable that a public meet- 
ing will also be arranged for Friday 
evening, at which Mrs. Berry will 


_. Guest of Mrs, Underwood. 

She will be the guest. while'in the 
city, of Mr. and Mrs. §darvin Under. 
wood, who are her -personal friends. 
Concerning the position and standing 
of Mrs. Berry, Mrs. Underwood, her- 
self.an authority on art, is quoted 
as follows: 

“Mrs. Rose V. S. Berry lives in 
Berkeley, Cal. Life has _ brought 


sorts, and the result is a breadth of 
view, a@ synuipathy and an insight 
which make rare use of the stores of 
culture, which are hers. To a pas- 
sionate devotion to art and all crea- 
tive efforts of man, is united a de- 
sire that in our broad land every 
man and woman, every boy and girl, 
should be made aware of his heritage 
in the art of the ages, and awakened 
to his own possibilities of apprecia- 
tion and, in some cases, of achieve- 
ment. Fortunately for our land and 
time, Mrs. Berry adds to this ‘culture 
and this vision, the gift of doing and 
of inspiring others to do things. In 
the oft use phrase, she has execu- 


her enriching contracts of many 


tive ability. In many different 
places and ways has she helped to 
bring light where it was lacking. 
During the Panama-Pacific exposi- 
tion she was associated with Mr. 
Trask, formerly of the Pennsylvania 
academy of fine arts, in the direc- 
tion of the art department and ex- 
hibits and was an official lecturer in 
the galleries of the exywsition. 

“For a. number of years she was a 
leader in club work out west and for 
some time has been pressed into serv- 
ice by the general federation, being 
now head of the department of fine 
arts. Her letter heading reads like 
the year book of some great univer- 
sity, and gives an idea of the scope 
of women’s club work. 

“In the midst of a busy life, Mrs. 
Berry has found time to do some 
writing and editing, and the results 
are such that one wishes she could 
do more of it, for she visualizes every- 
thing she touches: 

“My own acquaintance with Mrs. 
Berry began in Washington, where 
she quite captivated the arts club 
audience, which is accustomed to the 
very best in the way of speakers on 
art topics. Mrs. Samuel Inman met 
her at Salt Lake City, last summer, 
and since has shsred my wish that 
Mrs. Berry might come to Atlanta, 
as she expressed it to me—‘I know of 
no one whose coming could mean so 
much to Atlanta in the promotion of 
art interests as Mrs. Berry’s.’ Now 
it would seem through the efforts of 
a few. including the art association 
and the art department of the At- 
lanta Woman’s club, Atlanta is to 
have this privilege.”

Study Class Holds Meeting 


At Atlanta Woman’s Club 


The study class_of the Atlanta 
Woman’s club, held the first meeting 
of the new year at the clubhouse on 
yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock. 

The meeting was called to order by 
the capable chairman, Mrs. ’, 
Stevenson. The Lord's prayer was re- 


peated in unison, after which one verse 
of America was sung. The secretary | 
being absent, Mrs. W. F. Melton was: 
appointed secretary protem. There 
was an unusually large attendance at 
this first meeting of 1922. 

The subject of the afternoon ar 
very interesting paper on the compar- 
ison of Maxim Gorky, Tolstoi and 
Tchekoff, was given by Mrs. Carpen- 
ter Jones. 

Gorky writes with a happy reck- 
lessness of revolutions and the non-ar- 
tistic elements of society. Gorky 
tried many occupations but the lure 
of the writer was too strong for him 
to resist so he chose the profession 
of writing. Tolstoi’s writings are full 
of sublimity, but he, too, deals with 
lower classes of Russian life. 

Tchekoff, although a _ pessimist, 
wrote in a brighter and lighter vein 
than either Gorky or Tolstoi. 

Mrs. McCord Roberts gave “The 
Life and Criticism of Tolstoi,” in a 


very instructive manner. 


@ Some critics totally condemn him, 


a

while others are most enthusiastic in 
their praises of him and his works. 


o6 : 
Tolstoi was deeply religious, accord- 


ing to his belief. He was born, lived 
and died in Russia. One of his best 
books is “Anna Karinnina.” 

Miss Ethel Mays gave an analysis 
of “The Lower Depths,” by Gorky, in 
a very pleasing and concise way. There 
is not much plot to the play, but it 
has a wonderfully colorful atmospheré. 
It deals with the plebian life of Russia 
and closes with a pessimistic eulogy 
on married life. 

Miss Elizabeth Chap. -an gave “The 
Life of Anton Tchekoff” very enter- 
tainingly. Tchekoff is considered the De 
Maupassant of Russia. 

The program closed with a synop- 
sis of “The Cherry Orchard,” by 
Tchekoff, beautifully read by Mrs. Sib- 
ley Lorenz. This is one of the few 
Russian plays that has no tragedy 
in it. It is the most characteristic 
of Tchekoff plays. 

It tells in four pictures the whole 
story of the landed proprietor in Rus- 
sia. It closes with a touching scene, 
where the madam in the piay has to 
sell her cherry orchard, which, through 
her thoughtless generosity, has to be 
sold to satisfy her creditors. Peter 
and Anna are the lovers in the play 
and it ends happily for them. 


Miss Kaufmann Weds 
Louis Stahl. 


The marriage of Miss Hortence 
Kaufmann and Louis Stahl was sol- 
emnized Thursday evening at 8 
o'clock at the home of the bride's 
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Kauf- 
mann, on Washington street, Rabbi 
Marx officiating in the presence of 
the immediate families and a few 
close friends. 

Palms, ,potted plants and baskets 
of pink roses formed the artistic dec- 
orations throughout the reception 
rooms. ~—The lace-covered table in the 
dining room was adorned with a sil- 
yer vase of pink roses, and silver can- 
diesticks held pink lighted tapers. An 
altar was formed in the parlor of 

as a background for wicker 

kets of roses, and seven-branched

tapers.

Three Atlanta Women 
Elected League Officials 


Savannah, Ga., January 6.—(Spe- 
cial.).—As indicated in dispatches 
this morning, Mrs. Harry 4Chamber- 
lain, of Atlanta, today g elected 
unanimously, president of the Georgia 
League of Women Voters,.which con- 
cluded its sessions here this after- 
noon, Five directors at large were 
elected from the list nominated: Mrs. 
Z. Fitzpatrick, Madison; Mrs. 
Charles Goodman, Atlanta; Mrs. 
Frank McIntire, who is a national 
democratic executive comimittee- 
woman. from Georgia, Savannah; Miss 
Eleanor Raoul, Atlanta, and Miss An- 
nie G. Wright, Augusta. 

What the league will stand back of 
in legislation in the state is indexed 
in the report of the chairman of the 
legislative committee, Mrs. McIntire, 
which, with its recommendations, was 
adopted. That report in brief cham- 
pioned the Valentino bill now pending, 
for the improvement of working con- 
ditions for women; advised a state 
survey in the interest of the children; 
favored a law forbidding gchildren 
working at night; recommended a law 
requiring medical examination of men 
five days before marriage with a cer- 
tificate of health prerequisite to ob- 
taining marriage license; urged larg- 
er appropriations for the Georgia 
training school for girls;. urged the 
change of the law m Georgia (one of 
only three states with such law) 
granting the husband right to will

his children to other person than their 
mother; indorsed the child replace- 
ment. * i approved the kinder- 
garten bill which will allow classes 
f.. children of 4 to 6 years taught in 
the schools of the state system. 

The program also includes’ the 
“equal guardianship” bill to give fath- 
er and mother equal rights in guar- 
dianship over their children. The 
league declined to+include champion- 
ship of the bill to increase the age of 
consent in Georgia to eighteen years 
on the ground that the legislative 
program is already full. 

The league went on record as fav- 
oring limitation of armaments but 
dechined to indorse the Hughes fdan 
or express itself in favor of absolute 
disarmament. 

The offices of the league were ap- 
portionel by the board of directors 
among themselves according to the 
method of selection. as follows: Mrs. 
Fitzpatrick, first vice president; Mrs. 
McIntire, second vice president; Mrs. 
Goodman, secretary: Miss Raoul, 
treasurer, and Miss Wright, auditor. 

The place of the next meeting will 
be decided by the board at a later 
date. The executive committee will 
consist of the congressional district 
chairmen who are now in the office or 
who may hereafter be selected. , 

A number of social events and en- 
tertainment courtesies marked the 
convention.

BLACK - DRAUGHT 
OVER 30 YEARS 


“Saved Me Many a Sick

‘Who Has Long Known 
Usefulness of Black- 
Draught. 


Naples, Texas.—“I have used Thed- 
ford’s Black-Draught for years—l can 
safely say for more than JO years,” 
declares Mr. H. H. Cromer, a substan- 
tial, well-known farmer, residing out 
on Route 3 from here. 

“I am 43 years old, and when a 
small boy I had indigestion and was 
puny and my folks gave me a liver 
Then Black-Draught was 


advertised and we heard of it. 

“IT began to ‘take’ Black-Draught, 
and have used it, when needed, ever 
since. I use Black-Draught now in 
my home, and certainly recommend it 
for any liver trouble. : 

‘= have given it a thorough trial, 
and after thirty years can say Black- 
Draught is my stand-by. It has saved 
me many sick spells.” 

Mr. Cromer writes that he is “never 
out of Black-Draught,” and says sev- 
eral of his neigbbors prefer it to any 
éther liver medicine. “Il always rec- 
ommend Black-Draught to 
friends,” he adds. 

This valuable, old, powdered liver 
medicine is prepared from medicinal 
roots and herbs, and has none of the 
hed effects so often observed from the 
use of calomel, or other powerful min- 
eral drugs. 7

Hop, and county organizer, Mrs. J. 
a 


A long time ago I recommended tak- 


ing yeast to cure impurities in the 
blood, to clear the skin of such ugly 
eruptions as pimples, to prevent black- 
heads and generally to improve the 
health.. Yeast became a fad—still is a 
fad, for that matter, and I think it is 
an excellent fad—so long as it is not 
everdone. 

Before yeast, I think the fad was 
agar-agar, Nobody claimed anything 
for that, except that it would absolute- 
ly break up the most stubborn case of 
constipation, and thus, by keeping that 
part. of the body in healthy working 
order, clean the blood of impurities and 
keep the skin fine-grained and clean. 
No one said agar-agar contained vita- 
mines. It was understood that its 
virtue lay entirely in the fact that the 
system in no way absorbed it and that 
it was nothing but an internal cleans- 
ing agent. 

But yeast was full of vitamines, and 
vitamines became the next food fad. 
Vitamines are the life-giving element 
of food. Some foods are very rich in 
them, and such foods, of course, are 
among the healthiest to live. upon. 
Now we have a new fad—iron. 


Raisins are rich in iron and the 
newest thing is to carry around a 
package of raisins in one’s pocket and 
eat a certain amount each day. Like 
most fads, this in quite harmless and, 
indeed, has much to be said in its fa- 
vor. Most of us do need more irob 
than we get in our ordinary ration of 
food, and this is an easy and pleasant 
method of taking it. We will have 
healthier teeth and healthier hair, if 
we take sufficient iron into our sys- 
tems. 

All these things are good—when 
needed, and in reason. 


A. B. K.—You had better see your 
physician about removing the mole on 
the face. He can do it for you without 
leaving a scar. 

Violet V. W.—The colored streaks 
that sometimes appear in gray hair are 
often caused by using a harsh soap or 
too much soap in the shampoo. Gray 
hair should never be washed with any- 
thing but pure castile, and this should 
be rinsed out thoroughly. It will not 
harm the hair and it will make it a 
beautiful silver color, if a little bluing 
is put in the last rinse water.

If We Believe What We Hear There

Suits When the Spring Comes and 
No One Doubts the Popularity of 
the Short Coat Made in an Un-

Last Summer there was no dearth 
of suits, despite the accepted popu- 
larity of the frock. In America we 
wore a kind of uniform consisting of 
a short plain skirt fastened at the 
side with a few gathers in the middle 
of the back, a jacket that ended half 
way between hips and waist, several 
pockets, mannish revers, long sleeve 
stitched at the wrist. The color was 
more often French blue than not. 


age as well as your height, I cannot 
tell you ‘exactly what you should 
weigh. Four feet six inches is less 
than average woman’s size, and you 
certainly should not weigh more than 
110. You have, then, 72 pounds to re; 
duce. If you will do this by scientific 
dieting and exercise, your complexion 
will improve as well as your figure.

The complaint was that we did not 
show originality. ll, what did 
France do? One expe¢ts originality 
there, although the tradition should 
be shattered after watching French 
women wear the identical kind. of 
gown for four years. What they did 
over there was this: They wore a 
gray cloth suit with a very short 
jacket that rippled at. the hips, 
which was held together with one 
button at the waist. had mannish 
revers, a breast pocket, black braid 
binding, and a short. plain skirt. 
Every wofhan in France had such a 
suit, in town, in the country, on the 
beach. in the mountains,

the same thing, that is to adopt a 


tailored suit; we have not chosen 
the exact model yet. It is too early. 
én the meantime it is well to get out 
all one’s blouses and see to it that 
they are put in condition; present 
prophecies foretell] the need for them. 
The. season is well advanced in new 
tailored suits and nothing so com- 
monplace 4s dark blue serge is ad- 
vocated. Beige is a ruling color, 
soft-surfaced fabrics run_ side by 
side with homespun and tweed, sim- 
plicity is apt to be ousted by novelty. 
Not that the ornate suit is promised. 
It was ever a non-essential, some- 
thing built on sand and not on a 
solid foundation. A tailored’ suit 
should be for the steady activities of 
life, not for its formal hours where 
a frock and a wrap should serve. 
The novelty given to the new suits 
is through the manipulation of ma- 
terial and the curious ways in which 
the trimming is applied. 

There is no objection this season 
to a straight line up to the chin, 
although the open neck is fashion- 
able. e small eonventional coat 
sleeves give way in. several models 
to a wide-wristed sleeve that takes 
on the character of a frock sleeve. 
There are slip-on coats which are 
fashioned on the plan of a jumper 
blouse, the opening running as far 
as the waist, where it meets a wide 
band of the material, which hold ik 
in to the figure. Over this band the 
upper coat blouses. This, surely, is 
a curious ent for a street coat 
longing to a suit. It usually makes 
its annearance in finely striped cloth.

Who’s Who in thé Story. ‘ 


Jeanne (Jane), Dare, beautiful, 
clever, but poor, resolves to stake 
everything to achieve a wealthy mar- 
riage and, after raising all the mon- 
ey she can through mortgage, savings, 
and borrowings, aided unwillingly by 

Henry Marrison, her childhood 
sweetheart and hopeless suitor for her 
hand, comes to New York, where she 
believes eligible men are to be found. 
and establishes herself as a woman 
of wealth and fashion at one of the 
smartest hotels, where she meets 

Richard Canby, a wealthy broker 
and man-about-town, who is attracted 
by her beauty and introduces her into 
his set, in which are 

Adele Parkinson, a young widow, 
former flame of Canby, who befriends 
Jeanne, and : 

Victor Barstowe, young, handsome, 
debonair, only son of a multimillion- 
aire, whom Jeanne marks as her prey. 
Barstowe is instantly attracted and 


These knitted suits are gaining rapid- 
ly. As women find that they keep 
their line and shape they are en- 
thusiastic about thei. 

It seems to be true that the kind 
of coat we wore last summer is 
shelved. The public may go on 
wearing it, but that does not change 
its position in the fashion scale, 
Women who have that partiquiar 
suit are weary of it for they have 
seen themselves repeated as in a 
maze of mirrors. They were as com- 
mon as the khaki uniform in 1918, 
Its multiple repetition will make 
women open their arms to whatever 
is different and the new suits are 
different. Of that, there’s no doubt. 
The ripple at the hips is one thing 
which is a change from what has 
been accepted over here. Another 
innovation is the use of cordings of 
the fabric. These cords run over the 
surface of the incoming jacket to 
sharpen it. 

The -nipped-in waistline of the 
well-known French coat has not been 
returned to fashion. It is not for the 
American; no matter what her weight, 
she does not worry about her actual 
waistline and it never presents the 


smallness which should be accentuated 


by seams or pleats. If she wears a 
belt with her suit it will be there to 
hold in the fniness which is about to 
spring out over the hips, and it will be 
placed near the normal waistline.

THE HOUSEHOLD 


Edited by Anne Rittenhouse 


THE VOGUE FOR THE BEAUTI- 
FUL IN TOILET AIDS. 

This is the day of the beautiful in 
many things, but perhaps especially 
so far as the accessories and appur- 
tenances of dressing are concerned. 


We no longer put a Slip made of 
huckaback over our shoulders when 
we have our hair combed, and a 
bulky flannel wrapper on when we 
make our way from our warm beds 
to our warm baths. We wear negli- 
gees as beautiful as evening gowns. 

‘Too, when we use cosmetics, we use 
them from really fascinating contain- 
ers. One of the things the shopper at 
the Christmas counters was impressed 
with was the real beauty of all sorts 
of toilet accessories. Jars for cold 
cream are made vf lovely pottery. 
Bottles for toilet water and perfumes 
look as rare as the tear bottles from 
a queen’s tomb in Egypt. 

There are tall atomizers for per- 
fume, a foot tall, made of equisitely 
colored glass, with a long, gold flexi- 
ble cord connected with a gold-silk 
covered bulb. 

There are perfime burners made of 
seashells from the south seas. There 
are others that would serve as the 
decorative motif in a French drawing 
room. 

There are the most alluring little 
French dolls. dressed in net and lace, 
tiny flowers and little ribbons, which 
serve as covers for perfume bottles. 

There are satin cases holding a 
few spoons of finest powder—the cages 
of printed satin diverting in pattern 
enough for the costume of a royal 
jester. 

Just as an indication of the real 
value of these things, a red lacquered 
box containing not much more than a 
sample of powder, cream, perfrme and 
toilet water. costs somewhat over $50. 
Some of the money goes for the cns- 
metics, of conrse, but more goes for

A CHANGE 
OF PLANS. 

After the arrival at the teahouse 
of Vera Dayton, Jeanne soon realiz- 
ed that there was not further op- 
portunity for a tete-a-tete with Bar- 
stowe. 

Miss Dayton promptly came over 


to their table and seated herself with- 
vut waiting for an invitation. 
“Whatever are you 
of all places?” she demanded of Bar- 
stowe. 
early? I waited and waited until I 
was bored to death with Alicia 
Forbes and the other stupid people 
who had arrived early. ‘Then Jim 
suggested cutting. . . . You know 
Mr. Farnham, don’t you?” she beck- 
oned the other man who was hover- 
ing in the shadow. “And this is——” 
She turned to Jeanne with wrinkled 


row. 

“Really, I’m sorry, but I can’t 
recall your name, though I remem- 
ber meeting you at Dicky Canby’s 
party.” 

“This is Miss Dare,” supplied Bar- 
stowe. 

“Oh, yes, you're Dick Canby’s 
latest, aren't you?” laughed Miss Day- 
ton. “Poor Dick, he’s aways having 
a new crush! By the way, we pass- 
ed him a few minutes ago on our way 
out of the Forbes drive. He had 
Adele Parkinson with nim. She was 
a flame of his, you know, before she 
went to Europe,” she addressed 
Jeanne sweetly. 

“Really?’ murmured Jeanne and 
turned to the Farnham man who had 
seated himself beside her and was 
making some banal remarks about 
the weather. 

Vera Dayton promptly claimed Bar- 
stowe’s attention. 

“T was never so surprised as when 
Alicia told me you were coming to 
ber housewarming. She'd kept it a 
secret,” 

Barstowe laughed. 

“Alicia didn’t know herself, until 
yesterday, when I rang her up and 
intimated that I’d like to be one of 
her guests—for certain reasons.” 

“Oh, Vic! How nice of you!” 

The smile Miss Dayton turned upos 
him was radiant. She reached her 
hand across the table and touched 
bis fingers lingeringly. It was ob- 
vious that she thought she was the 
reason for his seeking the _  invita- 
tion. 
Barstowe flushed a little and tried 
to make the conversation general, but 
she went on earnestly: 

“I’ve been very busy,” he 
hastily. 

“Busy! Poo!” she made an airy 
gesture. “As if you ever had to both- 
er about business!” 

“But Vera, I’ve undertaken a darn- 
ed big thing. If I don’t make a sur- 
cess of it, dad will have the disap- 


said 


‘pointment of his life. You know he—” 


“Adores you, of course,” she cut 
in with a laugh. “The king can do 
no wrong’ in Mr. Barstowe’s eyes. 
And show,” she questioned earnestly, 
“how is your wonderful mother? I 
haven’t seen her since the family got 
back from Newport. But I sent her 
a gift on her birthday.” 

“That was very thoughtful of yau. 
Vera,” hé answered quietly. “T’m 
sure mother was pleased at your re- 
membering.” 

“Oh, I never forget,” she assured 
him. “I adore your motherf And 
she likes me—awfully.” 

“I’m sure of it,” he agreed. 

“Much better than you,” she added 
archly. 

A smile was his only reply, and she 
looked disappointed. 

Again Barstowe made an effort to 
turn to Jeanne, but Miss Dayton 
neatly interposed with a new subject 
of conversation. 

Jeanne kept ber attention outward-

“Why didn’t you come down) 


} 


ly chained to Farnham. They ran‘ 
the usual gamut of inanities of news 
chance acquaintances, She knew that 
Farnham’'s ears were directed toward 
the other couple, hoping to catch some 
of the low-voiced monologue « wit 

which Vera was régaling Barstowe. 
Jeanne quickly guessed that Barstowe 
suggested a formidable rival to the 
other man. Obviously he fancied Vera. 


Jeanne looked him over critically 
without seeming to do so. His ap 
pearance suggested wealth. She won- 
dered what his financial rating was. 
Would it be worth while to annex 
his interest while the others, mor 
glittering, opportunity lay close ae 
hand? 


Deciding that it was best to allow. [F 
no chance at wealth to escape, lest@}F 
she put all her eggs in one basket 
that might at the last moment prov@ 
a broken one, she surrendered herself . 
taéthe task of captivating him. 

She succeeded so well that, when 
tea was over and Vera Dayton calm- 
ly suggested that Farnham ta 
Jeanne on to the Forbes’ in his car, 
while she went in Victor Barstowe’s, 
Farnham cordially seconded the mo- 
tion. 

“I really want to talk to Vic,¢ 
insisted Vera. “I haven’t seen him 
for ages and we have so much in | 
common. Jim has a marveléus car, 
so you'll be quite comfortable,” she 
assured Jeanne. é 

Barstowe started to protest. 

“But I asked Miss Dare to drive—*“4 


Jeanne interrupted him by sweetly- 
acquiescing to Vera’s plan. 

Secretly she rather liked the idea—® 
for three purposes. 

In the first place, it would be good 
for Barstowe to believe that she was 
indifferent to his presence. ene 


she wished to complete her captiv: 
tion of this other rich man. Thirdly, 
she believed it would be better after 
all not to arouse Canby’s jealousy 
by putting in an appearance with 
Barstowe after having declined the 
former’s invitation ts moror down 
with him. 


So she climbed into Farnham’s big 
green car and waved a gay farewell ” 
to Barstowe, unsmiling, behind thy. 
wheel of his blue one, with Vera Day 
ton complacently beside him. e 

By the time they had reached the 
Forbes’ country place, Jeanne, with. 
seemingly reluctance, had promised t 
dine with Farnham in town on he 
very first free evening, wnich was a | 
fortnight hence. And she knethat 1 
Farnham was wondering what he had |® 
one. seen in Vera Dayton to attract 

im! 

Miss Dayton must have suggest 
a longer way home than the one 
Farnham had taken, for it was fully 17% 
half an hour later than their arrival 4% 
when Barstowe’s blue car turned intc® || 
the Forbes’ driveway... 


“Ab ha!” murmured Selby North 
into Jeanne’s ear as the two sat on 
a window couch sipping before-din- 
ner cocktails. “rhe kitten bring 
in her mouse to show the nice hous 
party what she can do!” - 


Jeanne laughed. | 
“Your metaphor is not particular- 
ly apt. Miss Dayton doesn’t resem}! 
ble a kitten to my mind and surely 
no one would refer tv Mr. Barstowe 

as a mouse.” 


“But the idea, my dear,” North 
insisted gently. “The theme behinagi 
the little: drama—it 1s correct! AIT ! 
women are feline, all men are their |/ 
mice. But the fatter and sleeker the 
mouse, the sharper the ctaws that wil} 
catch him. Isn’t it. so?” 


“Perhaps,” agreed Jeanne, emiling | 
into her glass. “But it’s a wise ca: 
who keeps her sharp claws concea}.- 
ed until the last moment.” 

He chuckled. 

“Meaning, I gather, that the Day. 
ton lady is too careless about leaving 
hers unsheathed?’ 

Jeanne met his glance steadily. 

“Exactly !”’ 

He stndied her for a moment, seem: 
ing to weigh her. Then he whistled 
softly. 

“When a woman combines brains, / 
with beauty, she’s dangerous. -* 
help the poor mouse!” at 

“What mouse?’ queried Jecant 
laughingly. 

North pursed his thin lips. 

“I don’t think you and I foo! each | 
other very successfully, do you?” ' 

Jeanne’s poise was outwardly un- 
shaken, but she realized that North 
was becoming a serious factor. .

Are you sure she is worthy?”

gre did her husband work last?’ 
De you realize that it’s quite pos- 
for her to go around with this

“She ended by saying, ‘Yes, I have 
quite a few old things of baby Mary’s 
and if you will look this woman up 
and can assure me she is all you claim 
I will be glad to help her.’ 

“Now I can’t understand that atti- 
tude. Suppose the woman were an 
imposter (although I doubt it, else 
she would not come back persistently 
as she does), wouldn’t you rather run 
the risk of being taken in than feel 
that you had missed a chance to help 
in this day of awful unemployment? 
Especially when it means only clothes 
ory you can not possibly use your- 
self, 

“I wish you would write something 
om, this subject.” 


I Think the Other Woman Was Right. 

As I wrote to my Letter Friend (I 
want you to know that I got her per- 
mission before I wrote this) I would 
be glad to write something on the sub- 
ject only I should have to say just 
what she didn’t want me to say. 

I believe the woman who said “in- 
vestigate before I give all these nice 


things away” was right. 

Whom was she protecting by insist- 
ing on investigation? Not herself— 
she would give away those things soon- 
er or fadter—but the worthy person 
who ought to get them? 

Whenever we give carelessly we rob 
not ourselves but the people who ought 
to have been helped, and reatly de- 
served it. 

No Excuse for Not Giving. 

This is a lesson that I learned some 
years ago when I gave away, without 
investigation, a fairly large sum of 
money to a man who claimed that if 
he could get his family back to the 
country town from which they came 
he could get a good job. I gave him 
the money for railroad tickets fo» the 
family, and he promptly disappeared 
with it leaving the family to appeal 
for further aid. Then I investigated 
and found they were professional dead- 
beats. I never forgave myself the 
waste of that money that should have 
helped someone who needed and de- 
served it. Henceforth I have adopted 
the rule of the Associated charities— 
if a person appealing for aid claims 
that there is immediate and painful 
want, give them temporary relief. 
Then investigate before giving more. 

But understand one thing. This is 
not a justification for those who do not 
want to give and who excuse them- 
selves by saying that the person may 
not be worthy. Better give unwisely 
than not at all. I simply mean that 
the best kind of giver gives the time 
and pains to insure wise giving, as 
well as the money or the discarded 
garments.

a part of Miss Alan’s collection, was 
found in his vest pocket. 


“At the police station he claimed

neighbors quickly gathered about, and 
one woman said she had seen an ex-

that Mrs. Olson with her husband

placed under arrest. 


“A count of the jewels found in the 
possession of Mrs. Olson, and those 
recovered from Chicago pawn shops 
showed that but seven small dia- 
monds were missing. 

“And that,” concluded Mr. O’Day, 
“is how the bulk of the famous Alan 
jewels were recovered with the aid 
of the dog with yellow spots.”

The “Fancy” Skater.” 


Earl was “cutting initials” on the 
ice, while a group of skaters stood 
around and watched him admiringly. 
He had already earned a reputation 
as a fancy skater. He liked to do 
his skating when there was a crowd 
around to watch him. He skated about 
with his arms folded behind his back 
and a “see how easy this is” expres- 
sion on his face. 

“Now I’m going to do some figure

to do them, amid “obs” and “ahs.”

“Do as you like,” replied Earl, as 
he skated off backwards. 

February was drawing near, and 
that was the time of the amateur

park was talking about them. Earl 
had never raced before, but he de-

all of his spare time on the ice, doing 
new fancy figures which made those 
who watched him catch their breath 
with surprise. Boyd went out with 
him to hang along, but he would skate 
off by himself, away from the crowd. 

At last the race day came. Crowds 
lined the shore of the lagoon. Earl's 
brightly polished skates gleamed in 
the sunshine as he took his place on 
the starting line. The starter’s gun 
announced that the race had begun. 
It was not long till the winner cross- 
ed the finish line. 

How he had happened to become 
winded so soon, Far] could not under- 
stand. He was a bit dazed when Boyd 
came gliding up to him to show him 
his newly won medal. “You might 
be a good skater, Ear!,” said Boyd 
quietly. “but you waste your time and 
strength in fancy skating. I'll teach 
you how to skate if you hike. Maybe 
that sounds rather mean, but—but l 
just .couldn’t help rubbing it’ in.”

The Heir at Large 
Continued Monday. 


The next installment of “The 
Heir at Large,’ the _ illustrated 
story which has aroused such in- 
terest, will be published next Mon- 
day, and thereafter will appear 
weekly. “The Heir at Large” was 
originally for use once a week, but 
The Constitution did not secure 
rights to the story until a number 
of installments had been already 
published. The story was aceord- 
ingly used every day until the reg- 
ular schedule was reached. From 
now on it will be a feature of The 
Constitution @very Monday.

The first anniversary of marriage— 
the paper. wedding—is. the most 
youthful of all annual celebrations of 
wedded hapjtiness. The one year 
bride and bridegroom are still a 
‘“voung couple,” surrounded by young 
friends, with whom they can laugh, 
sing and dance through their paper- 
wedding celebration. Gifts for the 
first anniversary are restricted to. pa- 
per, but nowadays there are to be 
had so pleasing a variety of paper, 
papier mache and cardboard novelties 
that there is no difficulty about se- 
lecting a gift for the occasion. 

Books and good prints are first 
choice, then cabinets of fine letter- 
paper, blotter sets, “handy boxes,” 
baskets made of rope paper, etc. The 
table may have paper cloth, napkins 
and doilies, rose paper candle-shades, 
bouquets of paper flowers, and even 
the dishes and cups may be of paper- 
wedding material.

(Continued From Yesterday) 


The girl’s face, as she stood there 
erect and strong before him in the 
presence of the dying man, grew ir- 
radiate, exalted, glorified as with 
an aura of heroic martyrdom. A 
tiame of passionate hope blazed in her 
eyes; hope, pride and gladness—the 
‘eternal spirit of woman, joying. in 
the outpouring of her blood, her life, 
+ give the miracle of life to man. 


_ Mautely the physician gazed at her, 
us the level shaft of dying sunlight 
ialoed her head. Behind her, on the 
biank white wall, now ypainted blood 
red by that light, the bars of the win- 
dow sash threw a black shadow, as of 
a cross. And in the middle of this 
cross the woman’s shadow rested. 


Tressor’s head sank a moment. He 
seemed communing with his soul. His 
eves rested on the white, drawn face 
of Bradford Vinton, then rose to 
Sylvia's. Said he: 

“Tell me one thing.” 

“ “What is it, doctor?’ 

“I must have the exact truth. We 
must waive conventions now and have 
facts. Certain accusations have been 
«ireumstantially brought against you. 
You understand me, don’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Are they true?” 

For a moment her eyes closed, 
drooping with pain as the blackness 
of this cloud rested once more upon 
her, Then suddenly her chin came 
9 again, proudly, and she faced the 
doctor with quiet bravery. 

Are they. true?” he repeated. 

“No, doctor. As God judges me, 
no !” . 
“No infection has ever been pres- 
ent in your blood, at any time? No 
impurity of vice or profligacy has 
«ever vitiated it?” | 

“None ae , ; 

“The slighfest’ taint would kill him 
now.” 

“There’s none in me! Absolutely 
none!” Steadfastly her eyes met his. 
thonest and unafraid, virgin of evil. 
“All my life I’ve kept myself in the 
right path, doctor. There’s not even 
a suspicion of a taint in my blood. 
My family stock is clean, too. It’s 
been clean for centuries: Now I’m 
offering this man everything I have to 
give.” 

“I accept your gift,” 
gravely. 

A wonderful light of joy triumphant 
leaped into her eyes. 

“Miss Pennell,” said the physician. 
“there are two principal methods of 
transfusion, as you probably know. 
(‘an you endure the direct method, with 
Avelin’s apparatus? The direct meth- 
ol is extremely painful. Sometimes it 
wvercomes the determination of the 
donor. Shall I have an anaesthetic 
for you?” 

“No! Pain? I shall glory in it 
«he cried triumphantly. “Fear pain? 
1 Jong for it! This wont be pain, 
‘octor. It will be only joy to me— 
the keenest joy in the world!” 

“What—what’s that you say?” he 
stammered, in amazement. 

“What can you, a man, know of the 
sacred happiness of pain?” she cried, 
iransfigured. “Only women can know 
that—only women can understand the 
sublimity of pain, when it gives life!” 

Astonished, the physician peered at 
her, silent with wonder. 

CHAPTER XV. 


The Gift Supreme. 


When, lying in her white iron bed 
lose beside that of Bradford Vinton, 
Sylvia felt the biting pang of the first 
incision, no groan escaped her. Only 
#n deep sigh, as of sublime content. 
welled from her heart. A_ smile .of 
‘ingular beauty. Wlumined her face. 
lier eyes closed. She seemed praying. 

Deeply now the physician drove the 
“hining pointed canula through her 
‘lesh and up into a blue vein in the

hollow of her arm, close beneath the 
constricting tourniquet. Gravely he 
rgulated the gushing flow of blood 
through the tube intotheempty veins 
of the dying man. With the closest 
scientific care he watched to prevent 
the passing of any air-bubble; for 
even the tiniest, he knew, must prove 


absolutely fatal. 

Now and then his gaze flicked over 
the girl’s face in quest of any sign of 
weakeninr, but there came none, As 
tonished, the nurse in attendance ob- 
seryed this strange spectacle, wonder- 
ing how Sylvia could lie so ,still, in- 
sensible to suffering, beatified by 
agony. 

With a solemn joy, all-enveloping, 
maternal and heroic, the girl now felt 
her life steadily and warmly flowing 
from her body into the body of the 
man she loved. A sense of consecra- 
tion wrapped her soul, a noble and 
majestic beatitude. The torment of her 
riven flesh, deep-stabbed by the harsh 
metal, seemed transmuted to a kind of 
strange and mystic ecstasy, akin to 
the ravishment that martyrs of anoth- 
er day felt in the flame that could 
consume, their bodies, but could never 
burn away their faith. 


Now already, as the doctor worked 
and tested, a certain change had begun 


; 
’

to manifest itself in Bradford. It 
seemed as if a slight, returning hue 
had feebly begun to tinge his face. His 
breathing began to gain in amplitude 
and strength. His pulse, till now race- 
ing and feeble, had once more begun 
to show firmness, 


Life of a verity was coming back te 
his wounded body. 

And as it come it ebbed from Syl- 
via. More and ever more profound be- 
came her pallor. Deeper grew her 
lassitude, till now every sense swam 
confused and vague, in swooning weak- 
ness. Still smiling vaguely, she lay 
there, making no sign, whispering no 
word to put an end to her yee vw 

The nurse turned a switch, flooding 
the room with radiance from the in 
candescents, radiance that now extin- 
guished the last sunset glow on the 
wall of the quiet room. Tressor studied 
both patients a moment. Then he 
nodded. 

“She can stand no more,” said he. 
fe dare push this experiment no fur: 
ther.” 

As he withdrew the canula from 
Bradford’s arm and Sylvia’s and dress- 
ed the wounds, his fage showed very 
grim under the electric light. Had he 
carried the transfusion too far? In the 
hope of saving one life, had he by some 
harsh irony of fate destroyed another? 
Sylvia’s condition was grave. She lay 
perfectly inert, unconscious, hovering 
now on the tenebrous confines of that 
supreme and august mystery that 
marks the end of all existence. 

With noiseless skill the nurse gath- 
ered together the crimson-stained lIan- 
cets, canula and apparatus on a tray, 
and departed in silence. 

Some few minutes later the door 
opened  hesitatingly. Looking’ up, 
Tressor beheld the old-shipmaster and 
his wife, pale, agonized and pleading. 
Vinton’s face was beaded with the 
sweat of agony; the eyes of his wife, 
reddened with much weeping, could 
hardly see the doctor as he beckoned 
them to advance. 

“Tell me—tell me—” began Eliot; 
but Tressor held up a silencing hand. 

“Shhh!” he cautioned. “The trans- 
fusion is over.” 

Dazed, the old man came forward 
tremblingly. 

“He will—will?” he stammered. 

“They both lie in the hand of God,” 
answered Tressor, quietly. 

With a strong effort the mother held 
herself in check. For a silent moment 
she and the old shipmaster stood at 
the foot of the bed, looking with ter- 
rible eagerness at their son. Then her 
eyes wandered to the other bed. Her 
woman's heart first understood the 
sublimity of the sacrifice, first yearn- 
ed toward this other, unknown woman 
who had from the brink of death called 
back her only son. 

“And—and she?” queried Mrs. Vin- 
ton, almost inaudibly. . “Will she live, 
too ?”’ 

“IT hope so. 

“She must! 
Who is she, 
why—?” 

“One of our nurses,” answered 
the physician. “As to her motives, 
l am not at liberty to speak.” 

Mrs. Vinton noiselessly moved to 
Svivia’s bed. The grrt’s left hand lay 


I believe so.” 
You can’t Jet her die!

sight for nothing but his son. 
turned his gaze toward Sylvia. 

Suddenly his eyes grew staring. The 
veins in his forehead began to’ swell. 
His hands went out, questioningly, 
with tremulous, strange motions. 
Speechless, he took a step toward the 
girl; stood there staring a moment, 
then, catching at his throat with shak- 
ing fingers, cried in a hoarse voice: 
‘“Oh—oh God—” ; 

The light, drenching down on 
Sylvia's bloodless face, struck it at 
just the angle whence it had been 
illumined that other day. so long ago, 
as—cmushed, mocked, spurned by him 
—she had lain fainting on the floor of 
her little parlor. The face he now be- 
held, as in a vision at this terrible 
hour of grief and stress, of hope and 
fear, was the same face that—despite 
all his hard cynicism—had so often 
risen up before him in the past months 
with white and silent accusation. 

The girl’s attitude, her pailor, the 
mute appeal of her abandonment to 
all-enguifing weakness, all were now 
again the same as then. Suddenly 
the old man comprehended everything: 
he grasped the magnitude of this su- 
preme sacrifice—the price of his son’s 
lLie—and plumbed the depths of his 
own monstrous cruelty. 

A groan forced itself from his 
trembling lips as he sank down at 
Sylvia’s bedside, joined his hands on 
her hand, and bowed his head in the 


first prayer that for long, long years 
had welled from his hard heart: 

“Oh, God, oh, God, forgive me, for 
I knew not what I did.” ,- 


Only a single incandescent now 
burned, dim-shaded, in the quiet room. 
The others had all been extinguish- 
ed, so that the girl and SBradford 
might not be disturbed. 


“Doctor,” the old man was saying 
in a tone quite strange to him, “now 
that her life is assured, as well as 
my son’s, I—I feel at a great loss to 
soot how I can ever hope to reward 

er,” 


Vinton stood a moment looking 
down at, Sylvia and Bradford. Then 
he moved silently in between the beds. 
Outside the coverlet lay Bradford’s 
hand, half-open on the white cloth, 
not far from Sylvia’s. 

The old man took the girl's nerve. 
less hand and laid it gently in that 
of his boy. 

Bradford stirred. sighed deeply and 
opened languid, pain-wearied eyes. In 
the half-light he peered up at his fa- 
ther, bending over him. A moment 
he“looked up, understanding nothing; 
then his lips framed two whispered 
words, all but inaudibly: 

“Hello, dad !”’ 

“My boy!” answered his father. 
his voice a different voice from any 
Bradford has ever heard. 

“Where's momsey ?” 

“Here, right here,” the mother an-

swered, with a catch in her voice at 
‘sound of the pet name she had not 
heard in many years. since Bradford 
was a little boy. “We're both here, 
You’re all right now—everythin,z s au 
right.” 

The ghost of a wan smile curved 
Bradford’s lips, and for a minute he 
closed his eyes, lying very still in the 
white, white bed under the dim-shad- 
ed lamp. But presently he became 
conscious of a hand lying inert in his, 
a hand he knew, a hand he would 
have known at any crisis, through any 
pain, even in the hour of death. A 
few seconds he seemed wondering; 
then with an effort he somewhat turn- 
ed his head. At sight of the girl, 
inert and pale, his eyes deepened with 


yearning and. with love. 


A question. | 


too, lay in them, and a sudden anx- 
ious fear. 

“Tell me—father—”~ 

“My boy?’ 

“What is—Sylvia doing here?” 

‘She has just given you the great 
gift of life, by risking hers.” 

Came a brief silence, while Bruad- 
ford pondered this, vaguely, for al! 
his thoughts seemed very strange and 
far. Then, half-understanding, he 
faintly queried: 

*Tranfusion?”’ 

Eliot Vinton nodded. 

“I might have known. 
is her hand—in mine?” 

“Becaitse I put it there.” 


But why 


Another little silence. Bradford 


whispered: 


“You, father? In spite of every- 
thing that’s been?” 


“Yes—because of it—forever!” an- 
swered Eliot, brokenly. “In blindness 
and false pride I would have taken 
her from you. Hear me, Bradford! 
Freely and gladly I now give her back 
to you, as she has given you back to 
us and to a world that waits for you 
and needs you both !” 


Then, kneeling there between this 
woman and this man, the old shiy* 
master folded their joined hands in 
his as though to consecrate their 
union, and once more bowed his head 
upon them, silently, in prayer.

FARM CONFERENCE 
10 STUDY WEEVIL 


Washington, January 6.—Fear that 
many weevils will hipernate in the 
weevil infested territory in Texas and 
reappear in large numbers in the 
spring, has been expressed in reports 
to the department of agriculture, and 
it was said today that the national 
agricultural conference which is to 
meet in Washington on January 23 
will give serious consideration to this 
subject. Heports of weevil activity 
during the past season throughout the 
cotfon belt will be available for the 
conference, which, it is expected, will 
name a committee of cotton growers 
and experts to go over-the whole sit- 
uation and consider the advisability 
of recommending a new line of cam- 
paign to exterminate the pest. 

Cotton men here said today they 
were watching.the efforts of producers 
in ‘those sections of the belt that 
are infested by the boll weevil, to 
substitute grain and other crops. Re- 
ports ot the success which some farm- 
ers have met with in introducing 
live stock are also said to have en- 
couraged planters throughout the 
weevil infested areas and Some agrié- 
cultural department authorities look 
to a rapid expansion of the live stock 
industry throughout the south. 

The department of agriculture to- 
day made public reports of the crop 
conditions during the latter part of 
December showing an increase of 40 
per cent in the area of certified sweet 
potatos in Louisiana, with shipments 
less than a year ago. A large supply 
was reported in Louisiana § storage 
houses. 

The cold weather of Christmas week 
was said to have caused considerable 
anxiety among strawberry growers in 
White county, Arkansas. Interest in 
this industry was said to be develop- 
ing rapidly in Calcasieu parish, Loui- 
siana, 

Due to the dry summer and autumn 
of last year, a shortage of hay and 
forage was reported in Virginia and 
North Carolina. 


Drink of Shine 
Blamed for Long 
Trip by Sexton 


Missing Georgian Found in 
Hot Springs After Six- 
day Search. 


Hot Springs, Ark., January 6.—A. 
P, Sexton, otf Royston, Ga., who has 
been missing since December 31, and 
was believed to have been kidnapped, 
was located here today. 

Sexton said he left Atlanta, Ga., 
for Macon, December 29, in his auto- 
mobile, and that he came across two 
men repairing a tire of their automo- 
bile. 

He helped them .ixs it, he claims, 
and one of the men decided to go into 
Macon in his car. Sexton claims he 
had a cough and that the stranger 
gave him a drink of liquor. He lost 
consciousness shortly afterward, he 
said, and remembers nothing further 
until he regained his senses on a train 
between Little Rock and Hot Springs. 

Sexton said that he had $50 when 
he met the men, but that he was pen- 
niless when he reached this city. He 
was uninjured except for a scratch 
on the back of his hand. He was una- 
ble to explain the anonymous letter 
received by the Macon police in which 
it was stated that he had been robbed 
and killed. .

John Armstrong Uhaloner, of 
“Who's Looney Now’ fame, spent 
Friday in Atlanta and held a@confer- 
ence with Governor Thomas W. Hard-

laws of each state in this country and 
endeavor to bring those laws up to a 
mgdern plane, whereby a person can 
not be shunted off to af insane asy- 
lum when he is sane and merely be- 
cause of the testimony of persons in- 
terested in the case. 
Said Jail Was Crowded. 

The Macon paper referred to was 
printed dn December: 2, 1921, during 
the investigation of the asylum by Dr. 
R. G.. Hutchings, famous New York 
alienist, and stated that the asylum 
at Milledgeville was crowded beyond 
capacity because of the fact that per- 
sons were committed there by a jury 
which had not the advice of a lunacy 
expert, and that persons once at that 
asylum had no recourse for freedom 
whether they were sane or insane. 
Governor Hardwick, Mr. Chaloner 
Saturdmy told The Constitution, com- 
pletely refuted this newspaper state- 
ment. The governor, said Mr. Chal- 
oner, read from section 1416 (1344-A) 
of the Georgia statutes the following: 
“The board of trustees of -the lunatic 
asylum shall have power, upon the 
certifying thereunto of the medical of 
ficer of the institution, to discharge 
or remand to the county authorities 
whose duty it is made by law to pro- 
vide for paupers of the county, from 
which he or she was sent, a patient 
in said asylum whose condition is such 
that no probability exists of his or 
her restoration to full reason and 
sanity by medical ministration there- 
to, and who at the same time is re- 
garded harmless and inoffensive in. 
spirit, and whose remission to social 
life would reasonably involve no dan- 
ger to the life of those with whom he 
or she sould be associated.” 
“That seetion,” said Mr. Chaloner, 
“shows uncontestably that a person 
can be freed after reaching the asy- 
lum in Georgia merely through the 
approval of the asylum medical au- 
thorities. Now the Macon newspaper 
article leads one to helieve that a 
person who is arraigned as insane can 
not employ an expert to prove that 
charges against him are groundless. 
This, however, is not the case, because 
Governor Hardwick expressly stated 
to me that the accused can employ 
psychological experts to prove his 
sanity.” ee 

Georgia Laws Approved. 

Mr. Chaloner, who carried with him 
a letter of introduction to Governor 
Hardwick from United States Senator 
—— of North Carolina, declared 

yat he does not need to fight for bet- 
ter lunacy laws in Georgia, because

that North Carolina appropriates 
$50,000 annually to be used in plac- 
ing movie machines in rural public 
schools, and that twenty counties.in 
that state have tried the experiment 
already with success. 

Mr. Chaloner deeded recently $10,-

says that the greater part of his es-

North Carolina and Virginia. - 

He leaves Atlanta Sunday for Mont-

influence officials to instill his plan 
for farm movies. He expects to carry 
this plan to every state in the union 
within four years, carrying it to 
twelve states each year.

That question is uppermost in the mind 
of every wide-awake man and woman. 
What would you give for the answer? 


You may find it in the- following: 
There is a town where the people are 
always waiting for something to turn u 
and unwilling to start anything: worth- 
while for fear of making a mistake.

cesses are greater and progress is more 
rapid. 

Without action we get nowhere. With 
it we have food, clothing, comfortable 
homes and all the blessings that flow 

~ from industry. 


This idea made the building industry 
the bright spot in the situation during 
1921. Happily it is spreading to other 
lines of business. 


This is a good time to build. We said 
that last year and you can hardly find a 
/-man who regrets taking our advice. 


We say it now with renewed confi- 
dence. You will do well to get your 
plans in shape and order material before 
the spring season begins.
