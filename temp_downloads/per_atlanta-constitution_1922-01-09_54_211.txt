her room, and a report to the police 
by a badly wounded negro that four 
highwaymen were responsible for his 


wounds, were the developments of 


Sunday in the fight being weged by 
criminals upon the citizens of Atlanta. 

Lum On, 45 years old, who operated 
a laundry shop at 3 South Pryor 
street, was found on the floor of his 
own place of business Sunday night, 
with his head split open with a meat 
cleaver, the weapon used by his side, 
and his cash register open and empty, 
indicating that robbery was the mo- 
tive for the crime. Had the robber 


arched his person, however, he would | 


have found 330 in cash, stored in an 

inner pocket of the dead man’s clothes. 

Police believe the murder occurred 

many hours before the body was found. 
$750 Reward Offered. 

Within an hour after the crime was 

discovered, the Chinese Freemasons, an 


Atlanta organization composed of lo- 


cal Chinamen, met at the lodge at 21 
Peters street and promptly offered a 
reward of $500 for arrest and convic- 
tion of the party »sponsible for the 
murder.

night when Patrolman Cunnin 


walking his beat, looking through a = — 


window, noticed the body of a man on 


the floor in the rear of the laundry 


shop. Finding Lum On had been kill- 
ed, he telephoned police headquarters. 
City Detective Brown was sent to 
the scene, with orders from Night 
Chief of Police E. L. Jett to closely 
guard the place and see that no one 
but detectives entered. Detective 
Brown stated that the Chinaman was 
face down on the floor, with one hand 
beneath his body and the other out- 
stretched, his head split open and a 
bloody meat cutter lying close by. 
Dead Many Hours. 
The body was stiff, indicating that 
death had occurred hours before. At 


the undertaking parlor of Harry G. 


Poole, to which the body was re- 


moved, it was stated that death had 
taken place at least sixteen or eighteen 
hours before being found.. 

Orders were issued detectives to se- 
cure fingerprints and to prevent any 
one handiing any article near the 
place where the crime was committed, 
until the sleuths had examined every- 


thing carefully. 
Lieutenant of Detectives Ed P. Ry-

Dublin, January 8.—The peace

Ireland continues to face internal dis-

PLAN TO RECONCILE 
PARTY DIFFERENCES 


Stress Statement That 
Country at Large Does 
Not Properly Appreciate 
G. O. P. Achievements. 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 


Washington, January 8.— A more 
toward party solidarity and an effort 
to find ways and means of increasing 
the efficiency of the republican party 
in congress, it was learned today, was 
the two-fold purpose of the white 
house dinner Saturday night which 
brought together President Harding 
and a number of representative repub- 
lican leaders. 

Protracted consideration’ was given 
during the after-dinner discussion 
which lasted until after midnight to 
the position of the party on present 
domestic issues with the result that 
decision was practically reached on 
what was described as two matters of 
first importance: Early enactment of 
a soldier bonus bill and early assem- 
bling of a republican conference to 
reconcile any. differences which may 
be found to Aist in party councils 
over coming legislation for refunding 
allied debts. 

The two subjects were interconnect- 
ed in the discussion since the possible 
income from the debts, it was fairly 
generally agreed, stood out as the best 
chance of recouping bonus expendi- 
ture, with a sales tax suggested as the 
alternative. 


Program Mapped Out. 

As a result of last night’s discus- 
sions, senate leaders had today an 
outline of à program for the senate 
which indicated that, after disposing. 
of the Newberry contest and the pro- 
posed ‘amendment to the federal re- 
serve dot, action first would be sought . 
debt fundt 
The. soldier bonus bill was ‘slated as 
nett in Une, with provisions for pay- 
ment dependent largely upon the tinal 
form of the debt funding legislation. 
Republican party conferences on each 
of these questions are scheduled for 
the near future, it was understood. 

Following the bonus bftl,\senators 
said, either the tariff or the treaties 
produced by the arms conference would 
be the senate’s work. Some senators 
did not believe the tariff bill would be 
ready to take third place in the line 
while others declared that the import 
tax schedules would be completed by 
February 15, a date which they be- 
lieved would be earlier than the trea- 
ties would be. submitted. No reasons 
for the belief were offered. 

President Harding was said to nave 
indicated his view that congressional 
members themselves should furnish the 
leadership and basis for agreements, 
particularly upon formulating ‘policies, 
but expressed a desire to co-operate. 
Secretary Weeks suggested that the 
debated questions should be thrown 
into party caucus in both houses and 
that the majority having so deevloped 
its own views, should proceed to ensct 
legislation accordingly, forcing recal- 
citrants into line. 


Some Objections. 


Objections to this plan of procedure 
were voiced, it was said, by both house 
and senate participants to the confer- 
ence. Operations of a considerable 
number of western republican sena 
tors. associated in the agricultural 
bloc, though embarrassing to the ad- 
ministratino, it was represented by 
their associates, were dictated, not by 
hostility to the Harding administra- 
tion, but by political sentiment in 
their own states, which hazard their 
re-elections. The cry of “cauéus} 
combination,” if raised, might force] d 
them, it was argued. into open co 
operation with four or five republican 
senators now sitting, whose definite 
purpose was declared to be to annoy 
the existing republican administra- 
tion. 

The president further took opportu- 
nity to restate his position towards 
attempted amendment of the federal 
reserve act, which would require him,

Free-for-All Fight Staged 
After Two Men Tell 
Three Others to Hold 


Up Their Hands 


MYTERIOUS WOMAN 
FIGURES IN THE CASE 


** 


5 


Four Men Are Arrested 


for Disorderly Conduct, 


and One of the Alleged 
‘Holdup Men Caught. 


The story of a mysterious attempt- 
ed hold-up, staged in one of Atlanta's 
most prominent downtown hotels, was 
told the police Sunday night after the 
arrest of five men, four of them on 
the charge of disorderly conduct and 
the fifth on a charge of. “suspicion.” 
A woman is said to have figured in 
the ease. . 

The man arrested on the charge of | 
“suspicion” and who, acording to the 
other four, was one of the two hold-up 
men, is J. J. Ryan, apparently 25 
years old, registered at a local hotel. 

The four men jailed for disorderly 
conduct as the result of the fight, 
which followed the alleged holdup, are: 
R. T. Leppert, aged 25, of 186 Peach- 
tree street, in Whose hotel room the 
fight was waged; J. P. Moore, aged 
28, of East Lake; P. J. Collins, aged 
21, of 31½ Ivy street, and Thomas 
M. Clancy, aged 38, of a local hotel. 

: Story Told by Four Men. 

According to the story fold to the 
manager of thé hotel by the four men, 
Leppert was not in his room at the 
time the trouble started, but the other 


three men were waiting for him. 


Suddenly the door opened and two 
men walked in. It ig stated that one 
of them was armed with a revolver 
ond the second with a. knife. 

Throw up your hands,” they said. 

The man with the knife approached 
one of the occupants of the room,

Then Leppert Enters, 

About that time Leppert walked 
into his room, and infmediately a gen- 
eral free-for-all fight started, it is 
alleged. 

The two alleged bandits took to 
their heels and managed te go from 
the fourteenth floor to the firkt floor, 
down the steps, in record time. 

The battle in the room had caused 
great exeitement, and when twa men 
came rushing down the stairs, one 
of them, Ryan, the alleged holdup 
man, was arrested by police officers, 
and the other one made his getaway. 

Ryan, when arrested, is quoted as 
saying that the whole trouble was 
over a Wom.n. 

The three men in the hotel room 
said they had never seen tlie intruders

same statement. 


Elders Poisoned

GREAT PARLEY NEARS 
CONCLUSION RAPIDLY 


Settlement of Shantung 


ted, While 
Experts Draft Final! 


Naval Treaty. 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Washington, January 8.—As the 
arms conference prepares to begin dis- 
cussion of the final draft of the f.ve- 
power naval treaty, some of the dele- 
gates are making a particular study 
of the question of arming merchant 


| vessels as it may relate to the limita- 


tion agreement. 

In no quarter is there 3 a 
disposition to raise an issue which 
might endanger the treaty at this point 
in the negotiations, but among the 
foreign delegations it is preditted pri- 
vately that the armed ship problem 
will be one of the most difficult of the 
collateral! questions to arise when the 
final draft is gone over section by sec- 
tion for approval. 

The Italians, Japanese and French 
all are said to feel that if merchant: 
men are to be permitted to arm as in 
past wars, the effect might be not only 
te vitiate the Project to limit individu- 


Bey ying that the status of a 
ew in future is, to be the 
status well. understood in international. 


law, the American and British dele } 


gates are not. willing to discuss the 
subject. It is the view in some quat- 
ters, however, that the British. may 
themselves bring the point up for dis- 
cussion before the treaty finally is up- 
Proved. 

The subcommittee draft of the in- 
strument was virtually completed to- 
night. atter a six-hour Sanday session 
of the naval experts, and the full naval 
committee probably. will begin its dis- 
cussion of detail and phraseology to- 
' orrow. or Tuesday. A plenary ses- 
sion of the conference to make the 
treaty public probably will follow be- 
kore the end of the week, and then 


the delegates will turn their full at- 


tention to a final attack on unsettled 
questions of the Far East. 

Meantithe the Shantung controversy 
remains in deadlock, but hope of an 
agreement during the week was er- 
pressed tonight in American quarters. 
The mediation of Secretary Hughes 
and Arthur J. Balfour is looked upon 


by the Americans and British as al-} 


most certain to bring the two groups 


together, although this optimism is not 


shared by all of the Chinese and 
| Japanese delegates.

Foreign Vessels 


Get Most. Cargoes 


To South America 


, 

Washington, January 8.— Foreign 
ships how are carrying the bulk of 
the cargo between this country and 
the east coast of South America, and 
are increasing their proportion, al- 
though American ships are making a 
better showing on the routes to and 
from the west coast of that continent, 
according to a survey issued tonight 
by the commerce department. 

During the first ten months of 1021, 
the survey said, trade with the east 
coast of South America constituted 


trade of this country, exports being 
twice as large as imports, 

In the case of the north and south 
Atlantic coast traffic, 71 per cent was 
carried by foreign ships, the survey 
showed, while trade between the gulf 
coast ports and the east coast of South 
America was divided between Ameri- 
ca and foreign ships on a 37 and 68 
per cent basis, respectiyély. The 
small amount of cargo moving between 
Pacific coast ports and the east coast 
of South America, the survey added, 
was all carried in American vessels. 


ican ships are carrying 52 per cent 
of the cargo between the Atlantic 
coast and the west coast of South 
America, 69 per cent for the Ameri- 
ean gulf coast and 54 per cent for the 
Pacific coast. 

For the first ten months of 1921 
the total value of trade between this 
country e west coast of uth 
America amounted to about 12,000, 
000 long tons, or less than 2 per cent 
7 the total of the imports and ex- 
ports of this country. 


CHINESE BANKERS 
WOULD TAKE PART 
IN LOAN, REPORTED 


Peking, January 8.— (By the Asso- 
ciated Press.)—Chinese bankers are 
reported to have formed a group which 
would join with the inter-allied con- 
sortium in loaning to the Chinese gov- 
ernment $90,000,000 in silver. They 
would contribute $16,000,000, taking 
as security the revenues derived from 
the salt monopoly, and the shares of 
the loan apportioned to the four mem- 
bers of the consortium, amounting to 
$74,000,000, would be used for refund- 
ing debts already incurred. 

The contribution of the Chinese 
would enable the government to meet 
its administrative expenses, the con- 
gortium having refused to furnish 
money for this purpose. Allied agents 
here are reticent, but it is asserted 
by Chinese bankers that the respective 
groups are being urged to participate 
in the loan. 


Boston Wants Job 
Of Reconditioning 
Liner Leviathan 


Washington, January 8.—An appeal 
to have the Leviathan reconditioned 
at the Boston navy yard hak been made 
to President Harding by Representa- 
tive Dallinger, republic ssachu- 
setts, who announced tonight he also 
had taken the matter up with officials 
of the shipping board, etary Den- 
by and Budget Director Dawes. The 
president was requested, in a letter 
written to him by Mr. Dallinger, to 
direct the shipping board not to award 
a contract for repairing the liner until 
the advisability of having the work 
done at Boston is determined. 

Mr. Dallinger declared that the dry 
dock at the ston navy yard is the 
only one on the Atlantie coast large 
enough for the Leviathan. The work, 
he contended, can be done as eco- 
nomically, if not at less expense to the 
government, at Boston as at any pri- 
vate shipyard and in addition would 
furnish employment to hundreds of 
skilled workmen whose services the 
government will lose if work is not 
provided for them.

On Salvation

(Special.) — Russia will have to work

Mr. Minster is a young man, a Rus-

to escape to the Pacific coast over 
the Trans-Siberian railroad. He spent 
some time in Japan. His last mission 
to Viadivostok was made in connec- 
tion with the recovery of a consign- 
ment of tea, which he found in very 
bad shape. 

The socalled anti-bolshevik govern- 
ment established at Chita, south of 
Vladivostok and north of Manchuria, 
will never be stabilized, in the opinion 
of Mr. Minster. 


“They have no money, no army, few 
friends,” he said, “and while they 
claim to be anti-revolutionary, in 
reality they take direct orders from 
the government at Moscow. They are 
under the heel of Trotzky.” 

Napoleon of Russia. 

Trotzky, the real dictator, is now 
the “Napoleon of Russia,” stated Mr. 
Minster. His power is absolute. The 
claim of the Chita government, known 
as the Far Eastern republic, passed 
through Vancouver en route to the 
conference at Washington, that they 
should be recognized as a separate 
government is an absurd pretense, he 
declares. If the powers at Washing- 
ton take any recognition of it they 
will create a worse tangle than ever 
according to Mr. Minster. The mem- 
bers of the delegation from Chita ar- 
rived on the Empress of Asia on No- 
vember 28 and immediately proceeded 
to Washington. 

Business conditions in Vladivostok 
are nothing short of hopeless, states 
the visitor. Always a seaport, with 
the tremendous falling off in export 
trade, the importations ceased because 
of the lack of funds to pay for them. 
Vladivostok is now stagnating. 

Capitalist With $100. 


“If you have a hundred dollars in 
gold in Vladivostok you are rich be- 
yond everything,“ declares Mr. Min- 
ster, “you are a capitalist, a power to 
be respected. You may command all 
you desire in the way of living .and 
lodging for a dollar a day.” 

The Far East problem, which is 
absorbing so much time and attention 
at the Washington conference, will 
never really be settled until conditions 
in Siberia are brought back to some- 
where near normal, he added. Japan, 
in his opinion, through her occupation 
of Kamchatka and the cost of Siberia, 
is merely making a strategic attempt 
to annex this rich territory. Despite 
reported withdrawal of troops, Japa- 
nese soldiers are everywhere, disarm- 


duties, assuming control in all civic 
and judicial operations, according to 
Dr. Minster. 

As the situation stands now the 
peasant class, the grand majority of 
the population, is dissatisfied with af- 
fairs. “They have not been able to 
appreciate the ‘finer qualities’ of 
socialism,” said Mr. Minster. The 
murdering and looting was fine for 
them in the first stages. Now they 
keel that they are being 
Things have not come out altogether 
as they expected, although, if the 
truth be known, they went into revolu- 
tion blindly, not knowing what to ex- 
pect. 

- Unhappier Now. 

“They are really unhappier now 
than they were under the old serf sys- 
tem. They are progressing nowhere, 
Russia, if left in her present state, 
will slide back centuries in civiliza- 
tion. The probable solution will be 
some grand cataclysm precipitated by 
the red army. No one knows what 
leader it might follow, what side it 
might next take. Whatever may 
happen, it could lead Russia into no 
worse straits than those in which she 
finds herself today.” 


GREEKS NOW FIGHT 
TO LIBERATE RACE, 
SAYS GENNADIUS 


Washington, Januar 8.— Greek 
armies are now engaged in the fight 
to complete the liberation of 'the en- 
tire Greek race,“ Johannes Gennadius, 
Greek minister to the United States, 
declared today in an address before 
the Cosmos club, his first public ut- 
terance in this country. The aim of 
Greece, he added, “is to complete a 
work which our people have never

„ have been sent to America,” Min- 
ister Gennadins declared, “to ask of 
America why the same — 7 sup- 
port accorded the heroic Greek people

land only did a voice of sympathy 
reach our deserted and decried heroes. 
It was the trumpet call of Daniel 
Webster, the stirring appeal of Henry 
Clay and the devoted work of Dr. 
Samuel Howe, of Boston. Why should 
that precious asset be obscured now? 
I have been sent here to ask why and 
to — every effort to refresh and

Arms Conference 
Pacts May Strike 


Snag in Senaie 


Human Impulses, Personal 
Grudges and Senatorial Dig- 
nity Among Reefs Ahead. 


_ BY JOHN GLEISSNER. - 
United News Staff Correspondent. 
Washington, January 8—The hu- 

man equation will figure strongly when 

the administration goes before the sen- 
ate to ask ratification of the series 
of treaties which will come out of the 
erms conference, 

Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, 
will lead the fight for their ratifica- 
tion. 


defeat of the Versailles treaty and the 
league of nations covenant, 

So now the shoe is on the other foot, 
and there are senators who will enjoy 
seeing it pinch. 

May Turn Tables. 

The reservations Lodge offered to 
the treaties Wilson submitted will be 
cffered to Harding’s treaties. Lodge 
will hear paraphrases of his own for- 
mer arguments used against the trea- 
ties he helped todraw, as one of the 
American delegates. 

The situation pleases many of the 
democrats who were ardent support- 
ers of the Wilson peace program. 
Privately they admit an intention to 
turn the tables on Lodge. Thi“ feel-. 
ing is even shared by some of tha 
democrats who hoped for the event: 
ful ratification of all the treaties, 
and will vote that way. But they 
will make the most of an opportunity 
to even old scores, to make campaign 
material, and will endeavor to carry 
over to the public the idea that the 
republicans are now simply doing what 
the democrats tried to do before. 

Republicans Also. 

Strangely enough, the feeling is not 
redublic to the minority. There are 
republicans as well who ‘wete not 
pleased with the leadership of Lodge 
and who wanted the Versailles treaty 
approved. They can see no reason 
for according Lodge any more consid 
eration in the matter than was accord: 
ed the Wilson program. Lodge is 
rot popular among some of his repub 
liean colleagues. His reserve, his ze- 
cent, and what is taken to be imperi- 
ous ness. are resented: 
tendency to dislike 
said to be his unwillingness to take 
counsel with the lesser lights of the 
party, and the newer senators. © 

There is a small group of demo- 
erats, also, who do not approve the 
leadership of Underwood. He has, 
dome of them think, been too close to 
the republicans. 
“derwood will be called on to explain 
just what the conference did, and why. 
There will be a measure of opposition 
to the treaties simply because Under- 
wood will urge their ratification. 

Human impulses figure again with 
a group of the chronic malcontents, the 
habitually unregular,“ who may be 
counted upon to oppose anything that 
the constituted leaders propose, It 
was a foregone conclusion that certain 
senators would oppose any settlements. 
no matter what their nature, that in- 
volved the agreement of the United 
Statés to do something in co-operation 
with another people. 

Long Discussion. 

These cross-currents, while not on 
the surface, figure and figure promi- 
nently in the lines that are being 
drawn. Little personal resentments 
and slights, dislikes of persons, a de- 
sire to have an eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth—all have their 
place. 4 

The entire membership of the sen- 
‘ate, of course, will insist on long dis- 
cussion, Senators will, quite natural- 
ly, want to know what it’s all about. 
And then there is the necessity of 
maintaining senatorial dignity, and 
making it clear that when the senate 
ratified, it is after close study and a 
belief in the desirability of ratifica- 
tion, rather than from executive pres- 
sure. The senate will demonstrate its 
right to participaté, and may in this 
connection exert its authority to force 
the administration to do certain things. 

President Wilson ran counter to sen- 
atorial dignity, and admittedly made 
a huge mistake. The question of execu- 
tive or — 11 predominance fig- 
ured largely in the last presidential 
campaign. So the senate, from per- 
fectly human impulses, will carefully 
guard its privileges and perogatives, 
and resent what might be considered 
any infringement on them.

hether the glare e footligh 
and the waves of applause from an 

b c audience have a stronger 
bold upon the affections of thespians 
than the click of the motion picture 
camera and the loudly-intoned orders 
ofa director was answered by the 
young and beautiful actress, Miss 
Madge Kennedy, noted alike on screen 
and stage, as she sat in the lobby of 
the Piedmont hotel Sunday night and 
gave the writer her view on acting. 

“On the stage there are so many 
diversions from the real acting— 
scenery, lights and speaking parts, 
while in the films every motion is 
watched by the audience: You have 
. be so careful,” explained Miss Ken- 
nedy. 

“One loves the stage, though,” she 
said, “the audience is so much nearer 
to you, atid then the parts are so easy 
to go through with. It is almost like 
play. After the curtain falls, though, 
you realize what a strain it has been.” 

Two Films a Year. 

Although the report has gone out 
that Miss Kennedy has deserted the 
films and returned to the 6 yer ne 
stage, since her change last fall after 
putting in three successful years as a 
screen star, she intimated that she 
would appear in about two films a 
year, devoting the rest of her time to 


Lodge also led the fight for the 


; There is a. 
as well what is. 


For this reason, Un- 


the stage. 

It was in the art school in New York 
which she attended, Miss Kennedy 
said, that she discovered that her tal- 
ents lay in the direction of the drama, 
when at 16 years of age she wae given 
the leading role. 

Later on a trip to New York accom- 
panied with her mother, she interview 
ed William A. Brady, who gave her the 
leading role in “Little Miss Brown,” a 
new farce-comedy that met with pub- 
lie favor on its first presentation. 

Under the Selwyns, producers of 
“Twin Beds” and “Fair and Warm- 
er,” Miss Kennedy appeared in the 
leading feminine role, and it was in 
these that her fame as a comedienne 
was established. 

Under the direction of Mr. Goldwyn, 
the moving picture magnate, a series 
of pictures was produced by her for 
the Goldwyn corporation, and in these 
films Miss Kennedy's fame became as- 
sured. Finally, Miss Kennedy entered 
a contract with Henry W. Savage to 
play the dual role in “Cornered,” 
which appears at the Atlanta theater 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
This comedy, which has made a hit 
in New York ‘at the Astor theater, 
will delight Atlanta audiences, it is 
predicted, perhaps more than any 
other in which Miss Kennedy has ap- 


peared. ä 
Born in California. 

A California girl, educated at Ber- 
keley, and living for the first sixteen 
years of her life within that state, 
Miss Kennedy expressed her liking for 
the south, and especially the part that 
is left of it that suggests the south 
of before the civil war—old places— 
white mansions half hidden among the 
trees. Miss Kennedy said she found 
these quaint touches in cities like Sa- 
vannah, Augusta and Charleston, 8. 
C., though they were lacking in some 
of the more modern cities of the south. 

As to the much discussed question 
of the modern girl, Miss Kennedy said 
she believed the girl of today is. the 
girl of yesterday, influenced more or 
less by the fads and fashions of the 


moment, though there is no doubt 


that we are living in a different day.” 

Hoiding the past in d regard, and 
saying tht she was herself just a bit 
oid-fashioned, Miss Kennedy spoke for 
moderation in dress. 

“When I say what I do, I hope peo- 
ple will not think me prudish, but I 
do not think cigarettes and drinking 
become a girl, however modern—they 
are so unneckssary. 

“Today on Peachtree street,” she said 
I saw a girl in knickerbockers. I 
think they look very well in mountain 
climbing or camping, but on the street 
they are merely an extreme which at- 
tracts attention. On the stage we 
learn that the first principle which we 
must follow is to be natural. Life is 
not very different, is it?’

After robbing him, they told him to

he proceeded to do. He was brought 
to a stop by a pistol bullet which 
struck him in the abdomen, fired, he 
asserted, by the bandit who had held 
the gun. He sank to the sidewalk, 
while the four thugs disappeared. 

A passing automobilist saw him and 
carried him to Grady hospital, where 
he was said to be in a critical condi-

NEW TESTIMONY TODAY 
AT SENATOR’S TRIAL 


Franklin. Tenn., January 8.—With 


the defense’s evidence ended, and the 
prosecution ready to present rebuttal 
witnesses, the trial fo State Senator E. 
N. Clabo, of Sevierville, Tenn., charged 
with soliciting and accepting as 
a bribe during the last session of the 
Tennessee legislature, will continue in 
the morning. 

Although attorneys for the state 
have announced that several more wit- 
nesses will be called tomorrow, Judge 
J. C. Hobbs said before adjourment 
yesterday that this would come imme- 
ately after the case opens again, and 
intimated that all evidence would 
in before noon. 

As the situation stands now, the 
prosecution has attempted to show 
that the $300 which Samuel L. Feks, 
Nashville attorney, says he gave to | 
Senator Clabo three days — the 
last Tennessee legislature session 
closed, was accepted as a bribe to in- 
fluence his vote against the sales tax 
bill introduced by Senator Womack. 
The defense testimony, chief of which 
has been the defendant’s own evidence, 
and that of Senator Candler, has tend- 
ed to show that Senator Clabo op- 
‘posed the bill from the time it was 
introduced, thus removing the necessi 
ty for anyone offering a bribe. The 
$300 which the defendant admits he 
received, was to have been used, he 
says, for purposes of entertaining leg- 


ington, Pa., a few miles from this 
city, and with New York and Trenton 
young negro who is alleged to have 
killed two New York detectives Thurs-

a dash early today in a taxicab from 
Jersey City to Trenton with a re- 
volver at the head of the taxicab 
driver. }

last night, where he engaged Adam 
Adubato, a taxi driver of Newark, to 
take him to Jersey City. ‘There Bod- 
dy is declared to have revealed himseif 
to the taxi driver as “Boddy, the mur- 


with .a revolver and robbing him. of 
about $1.75, all the money he had. 
Adubato, according to the story he 
told Chief of Police Culliton here to- 
day, was compelled by Boddy at Jer- 
sey City to take the road to Phila- 
delphia. The negro, he said, frequent- 
ly threatened him with the revolver 


was a reward of $10,000 for him, and 
if he “had to go“ he didn’t care who 
went with him, Boddy, according to 
the driver, said he wanted to get to 
Canada. 

After passing Trenton, Adubato ran 


out of gas. The negro compelled him 
to stop a ear going toward Lang- 


horne, Pa., telling Adubato to ask for 
gas, and saying if he made a false 
move it would be his last. Instead of 
asking for gas, however, Adubato 
jumped on the running board of the 
car and exclaimed: — 8 

„For God's sake step on the gas. 
I’ve got a murderer in my car and he 
wants to get both of us.” 

Without more urging the other 
driver jumped his car ahead, followed 
by a bullet from Boddy’s revolver, 
which smashed a headlight. Heedless 
of the lowered gates at a railroad 
crossing the strange driver dashed on 
and smashed both gates at the other 
side, just as an express train whizzed 
past. At Oxford Valley Adubato tel- 
ephoned the Trenton police and a map 
hunt was organized to capture the fu- 
gitive.

War Chest, Citizens’ 
Committee to Oppose 
Building Trades Unions. 


BY ALEXANDER F. JONES,

January 8.— After two 


years ofb itter and costly strife, the 
building trades war here Sunday 


‘reached a impasse that is to be fol- 
© lowed 


by what is, perhaps, the most 
unusual situation that has ever come 
versy anywhere in 
1 

A general strike of 60,000 building 
‘trades workers, who have been work 
ing under a temporary truce, is sched- 
uled to start Monday to completley tie 
up $100,000,000 worth of construction 
by ‘Tuesday. 

Arrayed against these unions is a 
citizens’ committee with a $2,0000,000 


war chest which will attempt to break

of the construction unions over home 
and industrial building and to insti- 
tute the open shop. 

y Contributions. 

This — —— pot represents 8100. 
000 eontributions of business leaders 
desperate over inability to get needed 
factories and business buildings put 
up; and thousands of contributions. 
down to $1 by apartment dwellers, who 
realize that construction is the onlx, 
means of lower rent. 

The committee was formed after 
every other medium of settlement of 
a disastrous labor war failed. Hun- 
dreds of federal and state indictments 
have been returned against the build- 
ing trades chiefs and contractors and 
Huilders alleged to be allied with them 
in the so-called building trust.“ 
Scores of indictments charging graft. 
running into millions of dollars, have 
been voted. There are, in addition. 
a large number of criminal cases, in- 
cluding murder, riot and all manner 
of violence, as a result of the war on 
the criminal court calendar. None of 
these cases has been brought to trial. 

La Leader Indicted 

Thomas S. . ot the 
Chicago Building des council, is 
under indictment on a charge of per- 
jury, growing out of the murder of 
Adolph Georg, one of the best-known 
eafe owners in the city, who was 
killed, it is charged, by another labor 
leader. : 

Some of the labor leaders have as 
— as five indictments voted against 
them. 

With hardly a building under con- 
struction last summer, Judge K. M. 
Landis was chosen as arbitrator and 
handed down a wage award which re- 
duced building trade schedules from 
top to bottom. The unions were bound: 
by the agreement to accept the ver- 
dict, but when some of the unions 
who had not entered the agreement 
refused to do so, the organizations 
affected by the cut began to balk 

Vote for Strike. 

Sunday’s completion of referendums 
by practically all of the building 
trades showed that they have voted 
to strike with the carpenters, plum- 
bers, sheet-metal workers and hoisting 
engineers already out. 

When contractors And builders con- 
tinned to pay the old wage scale of 
$1.25 per hour, despite the Landis cut. 
the citizens’ committee was formed and 
contributions for its support began to 
pour in, and 381.000, 000 was collected

The citizens’ committee wll under- 
‘write contractors operating on an open 
chop basis, and the middle west is be- 
ing flooded with anpeals for workers 
on this basis. The committee had 
nledged itself to support every union 
that agreed to work under the Landis 
award, but when the building trades 
couenil voted Sunday to support the 
unions now on strike by a sympathetic

Million Die 
In Recent Pogrom 
_ Staged in Ukraine 


London, January 8.—(By the As- 
sociated Press.}—At the second an- 


nual conference of the Federation of 
Ukrainian Jews, the Very Rev. Joseph 
Hertz, chief rabbi of the British em- 
pire,.called attention to the “aston- 
ishing fact that in the moral history 
of contemporary humanity that one 
of the blackest pages in the annals 
of man has just closed, and yet the 
world knows next to,/nothing of the 
unspeakable horrorg and infinite 
crimes pe trated against the Jewish 
people.’ 

Dr. Hertz declared that one mil- 
lion human beings had been butchered, 
and that for three years three million 
persons in the Ukraine had been made 
to pass through the horrors of hell,” 
and that hardly a word of these facts 
had appeared in the newspapers. 

The voice of the Jewish community, 
Dr. Hertz continued, had not been 
raised as it should have been, and it 
was humiliating to find the apathy 
and callousness with which certain 
sections of Jewry had faced this in- 
finite disaster. He described in detail 
some of the crimes that had been 
committed. He said that, although 
the pogroms in the Ukraine had end- 
ed, there were “something like 600,000 
homeless children, 150,000 half or- 
phans and 35,000 double orphans in 
the Ukraine,“ who would die from 
cold, hunger or disease unless Jewish 
hearts remained human and came to 
the rescue. ä

that a vote on the treaty should be 
taken within forty-eight hours. At 
the same time he plainly stated that he 
intended “whatever happened” to re- 
tire to private life. 

When the vote was taken, the resig- 
nation was not repeated, Mr. De Va- 
lera merely alluding to it when he 
arose and in a voice broken with emo- 
tion, began to explain his personal po- 
sition. But he had not got far when 
he sat down, unable to go on. 

Later De Valera summoned a meet- 
ing for today, exclusively confined te 
the 57 deputies who voted against the 
treaty, and today at the Mansion house 
prior to the private session of his as- 
sistants, he delivered a speech which 
was a clear indication of his intention 
to continue the fight, this/time ap- 
rarently not only against the British 
government but against the provisional 
government of the Irish Free State, 
which the chief objection is that it 
derives its anthority from the British 
parliament. 

Inconsistencies Puzzling. 

There are many tonight who are of 
the opinion that the question of Mr. 
De Valera’s suspended resignation 
must be debated at tomorrow’s meet- 
ing of the dail. The inconsistencies 
in his declaration have puzzled all 
commentators, but Art O’Brien, pres- 
ident of the Self-Determination Lague 
of Great Britain, who, although not a 
member of the dail has been privi- 
leged during the debate to sit among 
the members and who is in elosest 
touch and sympatiy with De Falera, 
informed the Associated Press today 
that his interpretation is that Mr. De 
Valera will resign the presidency and 
retire to private life only when he has 
consolidated tke republican position. 

The task of the new provisional gov- 
ernment, faced by opposition from 
old republican colleagues, will be ex- 
tremely difficult. Some of the depu- 
ties, including Miss MacSwiney, have 
frankly declared their intention to act 
from the outset as rebels against the 
provisional government. 

It is taken for granted that the 
provisional government will certainly 
include both Arthur Griffith and 
Michael Collins. Their assistants are 
less clearly marked out, but among 


the members of the dail cabinet sup- 
them is William Cosgrave.

colleagues. | 

For the past year Cosgrave lias con- 
trolled the great majority of the Irish 
local representative bodies which for- 
merly obeyed the orders of Sir Henry 
Robinson, the crown representative of 
local government in Ireland. 


It will be a nice problem for the | 


ministers of the new provisional gov- 
ernment to determine how far they 
will use the existing machinery of the 
British government’s officials in Iire- 
land and how far they will be able to 
rely on the co-operation of the machine 
which they constructed for themselves 
in conflict with these officials. Un- 
der any circumstances the transmis- 
sion period which must intervene be- 
fore the Free State government and its 
executives can be legally constituted 
would be a time of great difficulty. 
That difficulty will be enormously in- 
creased if the new ministry is obliged 
at the same time to resist an attack 
from the surviving republic ministry. 

The dail tomorrow will consider a 
resolution in general terms proposed 
by Spéaker MacNeill, affirming Ire- 
land’s sovereign status and the com- 
‘plete authority of tbe Irish people. 
It is so framed that most of the na- 
tionalist lrishmen and all the members 


of the dail eireann could accept it 
as an unquestionable truism, but ac- 
cording to the contention of De Va- 
lera and his supporters, acceptance 
of the treaty is abrogation of that 
principle and in the debate they are 
expected to say 80. 
De Valera Attitude. 

Mr. De Valera’s attitude with re- 
gard to the acceptance by the dail is 
that woth machines must continue in 
being until disestablished by the Irish 
people, who set them up. Normally 
the transference of the majority from 
one side to the other would involve 
a change in the ministry, and even- 
tually, if the treaty is acted upon, 
the Free State parliament elected by 
the ‘Irish people would naturally re- 
place the dail. 

But meanwhile it is considered ex- 
tremely improbable that the dail will 
dissolve itself. The majority for the 
treaty included many who expressed 
a dislike for it, and only accepted it as 
an alternative to war. Practically all 
the members, including Michael Col- 
lins, repudiated any finality ‘in the 
treaty. 

On any motion framed on purely re- 
publican principles, it isn ot doubted 
that De Valera would still command a 
majority in the dail. Though it was 
admitted on all sides during the course 
of the debate that the great majority 
af Irish people favored accepting the 
treaty and giving the free state govern- 
ment a trial, re is technically no 
machinery whereby the dail could. for 
the present, be replaced by an election. 
The dail owes its existence to election 
by the people under the terms of the 
British act of parliament, which de- 
fined the constituenciees. allloted their 
numbers and prescribed proportional 
representation as the method of elec- 


tion. 
Intention of Act. 


The intention of the cat. of course. 
was that the members so eletced could 
constitute the parliament of southern 
ane under the home-rule act of 


If the parliament had ever been 
constituted, it could hold elections any 
time in accordance with the provisions 
of the statute. But all the Sinn Fein 
members refused to attend the parlia- 
ment, a preliminary condition of whose 
existence was an oath of allegia: 
to the king, and formed the dail eire- 
ann instead. 

There is thus none of the customary 
machinery for holding regualr elec- 
tions.- By the terms of the treaty, its 
| ratification can only be effected, not 
by the dail, but by a meeting of the 
members elected to the southern par- 
liament, whether they accepted that 
office or not.. There is one member of 
the dail who has sat for a northern 
Treland constituency, and four mem- 
bers for Trinity college. 

Ratifying Body. 

Under the treaty, it is the function 
of the British government to summon 
the ratifying body, but all steps in 
that direction were postponed. until it 
should be seen from the division in the 
dail eireann whether it was worth 
while. It is sssumed now .that the 
ratifying body would be summoned im- 
mediately, but it is not known if the 
fifty-seven oppesing members would 
desire to attend. It is supposed that 


their complete repudiation of the 


would be withdiawn. Another out- 
ecme of the treaty will be the :elease 
of all political prisoners. 

When the treaty was signed in Lon- 
con there were in various prisons and 
internment camps, both in Ireland and 
England, more than five thousazd po- 
litical prisoners. Of these it was es- 
timated there were 4,000 mer and 
wemen against whom no charge 
been made, but who were interned or 
imprisoned on suspicion that they were 
in sympathy with the republican par- 
ty. ey were given their freedom 
on signature of the document. About 
1.000 were men convicted for the most 
part by court-martial, of various of- 
fenses under the special act of parlia- 
ment known as the regulation of order 
act, aimed at the suppression of the 
Sinn Fein movement. : 

The military authorities here evi- 
dently consider the vote in favor of 
the peace treaty by the Dail Eireann 
as a final decision on the Irish situa- 
tion. Ever since the Dublin city hall 
was commandeered by the military and 
courts-martial were held there, the 
bui'ding had een surrounded by 
barbed wire entanglements which pro- 
zected across the pavement. 

This morning soldiers began clear- 
ing away all the wire. 


W. IL. GEORGE PLEADS 


CASE FOR FLAPPER 
(Continued From Page 1). 


of maturity garnishes itself with the 
frivolous parsley of youth. 


True Flapper. 


The true flapper begins before she 
leaves school. Eventually she marries 
and flaps only within the home—that 
is, if she is wise. Thus it is the un- 
married flapper who interests us; 
she seems to have so good a time, vis- 
iting in one day four restaurants, two 
theaters and three movies, attended al- 
ways by an ever-changing man. And 
yet—the world does cruel things to 
flappers! 

In Ursula Trent I drew the picture 
of a flapper. She liked pleasure and 
she liked men, in which tastes 1 see 
no crime. Being poor she could get 
only what men gave her. So men 
took. If Ursula had not been brave 
enough to bear all things, she would 
have been unfit to dare all things; 
she would not have survived a life of 
misery and toiling, coming at last 
upon marriage and happiness, know- 
ing herself and her own strength. 

Asks Kindlier Eye. 


That is perhaps the story of many 
of the flappers we laugh at. In many 
of them lies tragedy, loneliness, pov- 
erty, unrealized ambition, despised 
love, inability to love. I suggest that 
a kindlier eye should be allowed to 
rest on the flapper as she struts along 
the great White Way. Her hardness 
is often a defense; her shrill laugh- 
ter holds a note of pain; her lust for 
pleasure is not only a healthy lust for 
life, but an attempt to crowd some 
emotion into an existence otherwise 
empty. 

Tears are always near this merri- 
ment, for the flapper is a woman able 
to suffer and to love. Why is she a 
flapper? Why does she remain a 
flapper? Because true love, real life, 
does not readily give her a chance to 
be a woman. It is not entirely her 
own fault.

ule percentages, and political strength 
for various demands as to amounts 
sought in it. 

In these, however, it was insisted 
that no consclusion was reached. The 
debt refunding bill, in the view repre- 
sented as being taken by the president, 
should not be definitely tied to soldier 
bonus proposals or funds anticipated 
from it set aside for the payments, 
but it was agreed that early action 
upon it might help the treasury posi- 
tion, and make the task of meeting 


bonus charges easier. ; 
Tt is likely, those present considered.

Bonus Bill Plans. 
As regards the form of the bonus

ion that the senate finance committee 
would make no change in the house 
measure, This would mean acceptance 
of the proposal advocated by Secretary 
Mellon that no restrictions should be 
placed on the. debt ¢ommission as to 
the time which it might deem advis-

It was said today that the president

Democratic senators, headed by Sen- 
ator Simmons, of North Caroiina, 
ranking member of his party on the 
finance committee, have steadfastly op- 
posed the Mellon plan and it is known 
that they are prepared to offer amend- 
ments carrying out their idea of. lim- 
itations and restrictions on the com- 

ission’s functions. Further, it was 

eclared by republican senators that 
one amendment which would compel 
the payment of all foreign obligations 
in years, probably would be accept- 
ed. Mré Harding was represented as 
not ‘being opposed to such a change, 
but it was insisted that it would have

set by the British experts—five hun- 
ared millions. 

The latest discussions on this point 
between Briand and Lloyd George 
have been acrid, and the clash of 
ideas more frequent as the debate 
progresses. It is learned that up to 
the last moment, Premier. Briand hot- 
ly insisted that the Germans should 
not be summoned to Cannes until the 
allies themselves had reached an 
agreement. d 


delegates summoned at once, retort- 
ing: “You yourself have been talk- 
ing to the Germans in Paris.“ 

“Who has?” queried Briand sharp- 
ly. 2 
“Well, they came to Paris to talk 
to the reparations commission,” Lloyd 
George returned, 

“That is whom they should deal 
with,” Briand declared triumphantly. 
“Under the Versailles treaty they 
should not deal with us, but with 
the reparations commission.” 

By the compromise reached later, 
the German delegates were to be sum- 
moned as far as Paris. 

Lloyd George charged that the 
French had prevented Dr, Walter 
Rathenau from coming to Cannes. 

“We didn’t,” Briand rejoined. “If 
he had a passport he could go any- 
where.“ 

The British premier was clearly 
vexed at the general laugh that trav- 


eled through the room at the remark. | 

But whatever has or has not been 
accomplished, the outstanding fact 
has carried in principle, every clause 
of the platform he luid down before 
coming to Cannes, and that in spite 
of a few concessions, his is the great 
victory.

tary character witness, and tbereby 
to sanction the orgies of election cor- 
ruption.” The existence of such cor- 
ruption was “solemnly adjudged” by 
both federal ana state courts of Mich- 
igan, Mr. Hull added, and warned that 
the “partisan republicans“ may over- 
look the enormity of the charges and 
the gravity of the offense, but that 
“the American people will not close 
their eyes to them.” The people will 
be made keenly aware, th estatement 
cays, that if Mr. Newberry is seated, 
it will not be due “to political ne- 
cessity, but to a brazen ‘policy of po- 
litical bargain and sale, long pursued 
by the reactionary leadership now in 
control of the republican party.” 

Declaring that the honor of the 
state of Michigan, the United States 
senate and of the entire republican 
party is at stake in the senatorml 
contest, the Hull statement said it 
was “inconceivable” that progressive 
republicans can be led in “this 
terrific assauit on decency, cleanli- 
ness, morality, law and popular, gov- 
ernment in America.”

the republican state committee, and it 
is said the governor, being a close po- 
litical friend, desired to inform the 
organization leader before making his 
final decision. 

Governor Sproul, upon his return 
from Pittsburg, to his home in Ches- 
ter, had little to say about the sena- 
torship, declaring that he would not 
make an announcement on Sunday. 
He did not deny that Mr. Pepper 
would be the man selected. It was

in mind had narrowed down to Mr. 
Pepper and Lewis S. Saddler, of Car- 
lisle, state highway commissioner,

ARMED MERCHANT SHIPS 
PUZZLING CONFEREES 


(Continued From Page 1). 


was every expectation that the armed 
merchantman question would come up 


for an exhaustive exchange of views. 


The impression among the Italian 
delegates seemed to be that Great 
Britain probably would open the ar- 
gument with a statement of her po- 
sition for maintenance of the prin- 
ciples which,,in the past, have gov- 
erned merchahtmen in war time. 

The position of the Italians was 
said to be that the status ot a mer- 
chant ship would be ually chang- 
ed under the limitation T greement, and 
that if no change were provided ior 
the nations having the greatest mer- 
chant tonnage would become, in the 
nature of things, disproport ionately 
powerful. The arming with 12-inch 
or 14-inch guns of a 54,000-ton mer- 
chant ship like the Leviathan, it is 
pointed out, would have a tendenvy to 
undermine the 10,000-ton 8-inch aux- 
iliary clause unless armed merchant- 
men are to be considered as warships. 
Something like sixty passenger and 


chant marines of the great powers are 
said to have a tonnage of more than 
10,000 

Japanese View. 

The Japanese also are described as 
believing that the status of merchent 
ships must be considered in connec- 
tion with the general naval question. 
A big merchant ship, powerfully 
armed, might be a. more potent ship 
for shipping than a light cruiser, the 
Japanese say, entirely aside from the 
advantage in numbers merchant arm- 
ing would give to the nations posses- 
sing the greater passenger an‘ freight 
fleets. 

Although the French give evidence 
of holding similar views, and also of 
being uncertain whether merchant- 
men could arm under the new regula- 
tion prohibiting submarine attacks on 
to raise the point at this stage of the | 
negotiations. The whole question, to- 
gether with other proposed limitations 
on naval practices, might well be put 
over in the French view to a later 
conference, at which all the nations 
would be represented. 

A prolonged discussion today of 
technical questions involved in the 


stood to have been made necessary 
for the technical experts because of 
the urgent desire to the whole naval 
committee to begin final shaping of 
the treaty within the next day or 
two, 

New Stumbling Block. 

Experts were reported to have com- 
pleted their work Friday with the 
exception of the teehnical definitions 
of various kinds requested for 
treaty purposes. It was apparent to- 
day, however, that they had encoun- 
tered new stumbling blocks to delay 
theit work for the expert committee 
held two sessions, each averaging 
about three hours. 

There were intimations tonight that 
the questions of defining a merchant 
ship within the meaning of the treaty 
has been, or might be, again brought 
up. 

The question of armed merchant- 
men is understood to have been before 
the expert during today’s discus- 
sions. It has not been indicated as 
yet whether the treaty in view of 
the failure to arrive at an agreement 
on the limitation of submarine ton- 
nage or of the size of submarines 
would attempt to forbid purely mer- 
chant craft from carrying guns with- 
out loss of their merchant status. 
The British delegation was understood 
to be planning to bring this diseus- 
sion before the full committee if that 
were necessary, the deiegation giving 
| warning at the time of the failure of 
the proposal for limitation of subma~ 
rine tonnage that Great Britain could 
not consent in these circumstances 
to any restrictions of potential anti- 
submarine forces. It is said that the 
British are prepared to argue that 
merchant ships may carry guns with- 
out becoming auxiliary war vessels 
and therefore subject to attack with- 
out warning by submarines. 

British Argument. 

The British contention was said to 
be that a merchant ship mounted with 
guns fore and aft for use against pos- 
sible lawless submarines would not 
jeopardize its immunity from attack 
by submarines except after visit and 
search or on failure to heed an or- 
der to stop. 

During the discussions of the full 
committee on the submarine question, 
the Japanese delegation in concurring 
in the Root anti-submarine formula, 
brought up the question as to whether 
under that formula a submarine could 
be used as could any warship in main- 
taining a blockade. The Brigish im- 
mediately declared their opinion that 
submarines could net be so employed 
ynder the formula. The Japanese 
finally withdrew the question in the 
interest of harmony and the point was 
not settled. 


Huss Expert Arrives. 
John J. ivesky, a Russian en- 


Chinese Eastern railway, arrived here 
today in an official ca ty as a 
Russian expert to work for preserva- 
tion of the interests of the Kussian 
people at the proceedings of the arms 


erence. 

“We bope that the Washington

: 


“During the twenty-five years of 
existence millions inese have 
settled in the railroad zone, and where 
there was at one time a vast wilder- 
ness. The treaty of 1896 gives Chi 
nese the right to redeem the road 
after thirty-six years of operation in 
‘repayment to Russia of all that the 
railroad cost her. According te an- 
other provision the railway will pass 
into China's possession after eighty 
years of operation without any com- 
pensation on China’s part. 


“Up to the moment of the bol- 
shevist revolution, Russia’s rights on 
the Chinese railway were never en- 
croached upon. The temporary dis- 
integration of the Russian state 
brought about a tendency on the part 
of soche of the Chinese to eliminate 
the Russian legitimate interests in 
this railway. Fortunately, there were 
other Chinese statesmen who under- 
stood the danger of such a step, and 
on October 2, 1920, the temporary 
agreement was concluded between the 
Russian-Chinese co-operation.” 

Priamur Represented. 

A delegation from the Priamur 
government with its capital at Vladi- 
vostok has arrived here with the in- 
tention of presenting the views of 
that government on Far Eastern prob- 
lems to the Washington conference. 
V. S. Kolesnikoff and Joseph K. Okul- 
itch, the delegates of the Siberian re- 
public, declared today that it had 
been in operation since the begin- 
ng of the Russian revolution, when 
it was formed from several antizbgl- 
shevik factions. 

The program of the Priamur gov- 
ernment before the conference, ac- 
cording to Mr. Kolesnikoff, comprises 
the withdrawal of Japanese military 
forces from the Sakalin province and 
the return by the Japanese of arms, 
munitions, civil supplies and money 
“unlawfully seized by the Japanese 
in Siberia.” 

“Japan has occupied about 25,000 
square miles of Russian territory.“ 
he continued, and is regulating the 
entire life of the Russian population. 
While other foreign troops have been 
withdrawn, the Japanese remain and 
have begun the actual occupation of 
northern Sakalin and the lower Amur. 
In addition, they are establishing a 
naval base near the Estuary of the 
Amur river.” 

Japanese activities, the statement 
said, are entirely at variance with of- 
ficial statements from Tokio that the 
presence of Japanese troops has no 
political aim as regards Russia.

BUSINESS MUST LEAD. 
Long before the pestiferous boll 
weevil made his advent in Georgia 


“The Constitution preached the 


gospel of crop diversification. 
The doctrine of crop diversifica- 


tion had been urged for years, but 
it took the weevil to make ou 
farmer heed that advice. 

‘He has learned his lesson during 
the last two trying years at a 
tremendous cost. 

But diversification alone will 
never solve the problem that. now 
exists. 

The farmer must continue to 
produce, but however great hie 
production it avails him naught if 
he is unable to market his prod- 
uce .at profitable prices. 

There can be no general pros- 
perity unless the farmer is pros- 


The south has a virtual monop- 
oly of the cotton-growing industry. 
Although prices may fluctuate and 
the yield may be small, the farmer 
can always be assured that he can 
turn his cotton into cash. It is his 
money crop, but it counts for noth- 


, ing if he must sell his cotton at 


leis than it costs to make it. 

“When corn, rye, oats, ‘water- 
melons,. peanuts, velvet beans and 
vegetables are the products on 
which the farmer desires to real- 
ize, it often happens—and it is true 
now—that his market limitations 
are such that it is impossible to 
dispose of his produce at anything 
like cost. 


And what farmer has not been 


forced to throw his watermelons 
to his hogs, to allow his peaches 
to rot on the ground, and to carry 
corn over until next year because 
of lack of market? 

This is a problem that must be 
solved not by the farmer, but by 
the banker and the business man, 
In ‘creating a warehouse and an 
elevator system that will’ enable 
us to handle our crops like those 
in the west are handled. 

Scat is a criminal waste of re- 
gources to feed watermelons to 
swine and to let the juicy peach 
and other fruits rot on the ground 
for lack of proper facilities to can 
them.

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH. 

There is undoubtedly much truth 
in the statement made by Dr. T. 
Poole Maynard, in a communica- 
tion recently appearing in The 
Constitution that “Atlanta is sleep- 
ing on her possibilities for indus- 
trial expansion.” 

Dr. Maynard, a Johns-Hopkins 
graduate, Ph. D., a geological and 
industrial engineer with headquar- 
ters in Atlanta, is, as he says in 
his communication, in the employ 
of “the largest oilcloth company 
in America as clay specialist for 
plants located in Illinois, Ohio and 
New York.” 

The three essential raw. mate- 
rials used in the manufacture of 


seed oll. Of these three. comm4i- 
ties the firm Dr. Maynard repre- 
sents derives all of its cotton 
fabric from the south, and almost 
all of its clay from Georgia; 
yet there is not an oilcloth 1 
factory south of the Mason and 
Dixon’s line. 

“Companies now manufacturing 
oilcloth,” our correspondent goes 
on to say— 


“would be forced to consider Atlan- 
ta as a location for a plant if the 
opportunities were presented to 
them, for, unless they came, some- 
one else would be bound to take 
advantage of the opportunity.” 


Dr. Maynard points out that the 
south uses more than $14,000,000 
worth of whitewear pottery manu- 
factures annually. 

The three essential raw mate- 
rials for the manufacture of this 
class of merchandise are clay, 
quartz and feldspar, each of which 
exists in abundant quantities in 
Georgia. 

And yet, says Dr. Maynard, all 
of the pottery produced in the 
United States is made in the north 
and east, with the exception of the 
output of two minor plants, one in 
Virginia and the other in Tennes- 
see, which have started up within 
the last two years. . 

It is made chiefly from clay 
mined in Georgia, quartz obtained 
mainly in New England, feldspar 
from Canada. 

And each year the south buys 
more than $14,000,000 worth of the 
finished product that might better 
be made right here in Georgia, 
which state now furnishes the clay 
and is abundantly able to provide 
the feldspar, the quartz, hydro- 
electric power, transportation fa- 
cilities and every other ingredient 
or element entering into the pot- 
tery industry. 

So it is with the oilcloth manu- 
facturing industry. Georgia fur- 
nishes the clay, the cotton, the pig; 


ment, which is shipped north, man!“ 


ufactured into oilcloth, then ship 
ped back and sold to Georgians— 
the finished product price includ- 
ing, of course, the freight both 
ways. 

And oilcloth and pottery are 
only two of many articles of com- 
merce that are made elsewhere 
‘than in the south, the raw mate- 
‘rials entering into which are pro- 


Our chambers of commerce, 
boards of trade, commercial clubs, 
etc., might well afford to concen-

to the extent of encouraging the 
manufacture of the articles of com-

MY CREED 


To be a‘friend, a faithful friend, 
To every striving soul, 

To lift each struggling outcast 
Up to a higher goal; 


To have a smile, a friendly smile, 
For all who pass my way, 

To lend a helping arm and hand 

To those I meet each day; 


To sing a, song, a cheerful song, 
As up the hill we go, 

Journeying o’er the beaten path 
To meet Life’s every foe; 


To meet the dawn, the misty dawn 
With courage to fight and win, 

To guide each straying soul away 
From the road that leads to sin: 


To pray a prayer, a simple prayer, 
When lowly hangs the sun, 

And thank my God for what I have 
When eventfu] day is done. 


This is my honest, simplé creed, 
And tho’ humble it may be 

I think I can in this small way 
Fulfill God's trust in met |

pledges and 
satisfactory guarantees that this coun- 
try will take its full share of respon- 
sibility in international tasks and obli- 
gations. 

The churches also say with some 
sharpness, “We reject with indi 
tion a policy pi taking all possible 
economic & tages in all parts of 
the world, WIIle shirking international 
responsibilities and obligations.” 

This platform. which was unani- 
mously adopted by the executive com- 
mittee of the Federal Council of 
Churches a few days ago, has been 
presented now not only to the Ameri- 
can delegates to the conference of limi- 
tation of armament, but also to the 
foreign delegates, It calls for world- 
wide co-operation by the churches and 
copies of it.are alr on their way 
to the religious ieaderg of other coun-

The statement with other matter 
outlining the sentiment of the churches 
was also presented to both houses of 
congress through Speaker Gillette and 
Vice President Coolidge. Senator Me- 
Keller brought the document up on 
n} the floor of the senate and had it in- 
e Serted in the Congressional Record. 

It has undoubtedly made a deep im- 
pression in Washington, as it is real 
ized that the statement: is probably 
moré representative of the -sober 
thought of the American people than 
any other that has been issued in re 
cent months. One government official 
whose task it is to weigh public opin 
ion stated that it is regarded as the 
most authoritative statement showing 
the trend of American public opinion 


that has yet been presented. 


The statement, which is entitled 
“The General Obligation of America 
to Co-operate in the Establishment of 
a World Peace System,” is as follows: 

“We believe that the govern- 
ment of the United States should 
associate itself promptly with the 
other nations of the world to 
establish permanent institutions 
for the formation of international 
law for the effective operation of 
the international court of justice 
and boards of arbitration and con- 
ciliation for the assurance to law- 
abiding and peace-loving nations 
of security from attack and spolia- 
tion by any lawless and aggres- 
sive nation and for the provision 
of fair treatment and equal eco- 
nomic opportunity to all individ- 
ual citizens of law-abiding and 
peace-loving nations. 

“We believe that only by these 
institutions and agencies will it be 
possible and practicable to abol- 
ish. the menace to the entire hu- 
man race of submarines of aero- 
planes and of poison gases. 

We believe further that the 
reconstruction of the shattered 
institutions of production of ex- 
change of trade and of credit all 
so essential to the peace and pros- 
perity of the nations is possible 
only when the feverish fearg and 
preparations for possible war are 
completely abandoned because of 
the successful functioning of the 
institutions of an effective world

The Banco de la Nacion bas de- 
creased rates effective January 1, and 
is considering the above mentioned ex-

The municipality of the city of Bue-

on the other hand, there is little for- 
eign investment capital coming in 
other than some which is directed to- 
ward the exploitation of the petroleum 
resourcés of the country. 

The average exchange on New York 
during, the month of December was 
1.33, as against 1.35 the month pre- 
vious. Rates are steady, however, 
due to the disposal of the proceeds 
of the recent $50,000.000 loan and 
the fact that there are a large amount 
of funds to be remitted, a rise is ex- 
pected shortly. 

Collections for December amounted 
to 10,000,000 paper pesos (1 paper 
peso equals 50.4245 U. S. currency) 
and credits are becoming more diffi- 
cult to negotiate. Minor failures are 
occurring and there are many private 
arrangements with creditors. 


Imports are remaining stationary, 
and import stocks are generally lower 
than at this time last year, when they 
were abnormally large.

HEALTH TALKS 


BY WILLIAM BRADY, M. D. 


Infantile Paralysis. 
After the acute or feverish stage of 
acute poliomyelitis has passed, perhaps 
three weeks after the onset of the ill- 


‘ ness, the plaster casts or splints or 


other apparatus which may have been 
used to procure that most salutary 


ly stage of the paralysis, may be re- 
moved every day or two for the appli- 
cation of electricity. The casts or 
splints are disearded permanently 
when the physician feels that there is 
no further likelihood of relapses, for 
they serve no useful purpose after the 


stage of fixed or permanent paralysis 


has arrived. If the child is to wear 
any appliance or brace later, either to 
prevent eontracture or to enable the 
child to walk, that is a question for 
the orthopedic physician. 

The. best results seem to be obtain- 
ed from a ‘combination of electric 
treatment and massage applied three 
or four times a week for not less than

Editor Constitution: I see from 
Friday’s paper that even you are 
leaning to Andy and Min Gump. 
All this concern about Uncle Bim 
reminds me of a little verse K 
little dow now ‘atid then, plays | 
havoc 25 the best of men.“ 

I have seen for several days that 
Sidney Smith is “up against it” 
about this love affair, for several 
days everything looked like it was 
coming to a head, but the giving of 
the roadster didn’t mean as much to 
Uncle Bim as a post ‘card would 
have to the average high-salaried 
man. 

I think it is a case, of loving 
Uncle Bim more, and his relatives 
less, but he is foxy and may not 
walk into the widow’s trap. 

As for Min, she has already 
pulled off the typical “in-law” stunt; 
she takes all Uncle Bim does for 
her as a matter of fact, just his 
duty as she sees it, and how true to 


| form she runs when she sends that 


letter, to “her people” telling them 
all about it. 

Personally, I want Uncle Bim to 
marry; he’s had enough peace and 
contentment for one man; he hae 
held his purse-strings long enough, 
followed his fancy in bestowing gifts. 
Heretofore his card has stood 
out boldly, “From Mr. Bim Gump”; 
he has been an individual long 
enough; he needs atmosphere and 
experience. : 

Florence Huntly in her “Harmon- 
ics and Evolution,” has led many to 
the altar by telling them that mar- 
riage is necessary to the “comple- 
tion of the individual.” We hold 
Mr. Sidney Smith responsible if he 
lets Mr. Bim off undeveloped, with- 
out experience, without atmosphere 
and incomplete. Oh, shame! shame! 

We ask you to use your personal 
influence 73 this matter.

BITS OF NEW YORK LIFE 


BY O. O. MINTYRE 


New York, January 8.—4 page 
from the diary of a modern Samuel

fruiterer’s to send a basket. Met 


B. Granville, the play actor, and

The city in grip of a storm, so I

a little scrivening I finished off some 


turkey bones and sat about in brave 


content. 

In the afternoon to a college play 
with Julain Street’s boy and mighty 
fine it was and much merry com- 
pany, and 1 find myself enjoying the 
association of younger folk all the 
while. Going through the town I 
chanced: to see Stillman, the bank- 
er; Mr. Lorimer, the editor; and 
Segurola, the singer, who clings to 
the custom of wearing a single eye- 
glass.

the Beaux Arts and there supped,

A Practical school of modern busi- 
ness that teaches the most up-to-date 
methods of the commercial world, not 
only to the regular students of ‘Tech, 
but to men and women in ali 
pea of Atlanta—such is the Georgia 

h School of Commerce that yearly | ing 
sends forth hundreds of graduates to 
all parts of Dixie in every field of 
commefcial endeavor, as stated yes- 
terday by the dean of the school, Pro- 
fessor J. M. Watters. 

Some interesting facts about the 
growth of the school were given by 
Dean Watters. It was organized in 
1911, the first school of commerce in 
all the sofith and the youngest of the 
it had thirty 
students the first year and 616 last 
‘year. It was the lar of the Tech 
school and its enrollment was one- 
Tech 
itself is thirty-five years old but it 
was not until 1917 that its entire 
enrollment was equal to the enroll- 
meng in the School of Commerce last 
year. 

The study of the most efficient 
methods of practical business has ever 
of the school and its 
teaching staff, according to Lean Wat- 
ters. For that reason the majority 
of its courses are under the direct 
and personal supervision of practical 
business men and business organiza- 
tions in the city of Atlanta. Its atu | 
dents daily do practical work in their 
chosen fields. For example, many of 
the advertisements appearing in the 
daily papers of the city are written 
by students, 

The school was originally organized 
with only evening classes. It taught 
to young business men and business 
women in Atlanta during evening 
classes the principles underlying the 
work they did in the daytime. In 
1916 day classes were organized and 
after the war special classes were 
formed for returning veterans in the 
rehabilitation division. The day 
classes constitute a four-year course 
and the evening classes a three-year 
course, For the convenience of At- 
lanta students in the evening classes 
they are given in a building at 18 
Auburn avenue.

Can Tell. 


Grandmother kept her hair beauti- 
fully darkened, glossy and attractive 
with a brew of Sage Tea and Sulphur. 
Whenever her hair took on that dull,’ 
faded or streaked appearance this sim- 
ple mixture was applied with wonder- 
ful effect. By asking at any drug 
store for “Wyeth'’s Sage and Sulphur 
Compound,“ you will get a large bot- 
tle of this old-time recipe, improved 
by the addition of other ingredients, 
all ready to use, at verv little cost. 
This. simple mixture can be depended 
upoR& to restore natural color and 
beauty to the hair. 

well-known downtown druggist 
says everybody uses Wyeth's Sage and 
Sulphur Compound now. because it 
darkens so naturally and evenly that 
nobody can tell it has been applied 
it's so easy to use, too. You simply 
dampen a comb or soft brush and 
draw it through yetr hair, taking one 
strand at a time. By morning the gray 
hair disappears; after another appli- 
vation or two, it is-restored to its 
natural color and looks glossy, soft 
and beautiful.—(adv.)

John Brown, a negro, is 


eae 3 councilman from 
eighth ward, explained his 
posed new charter plan and answered 
tics in an address Sunday after- 
noon to a gathering of more than er 
2 held under the auspices of 
age | Order of American Me- 

— at the organiszation's hall on 
itol avenue. 
n a pointed reply to councilmanic 
attacks against the charter Mr. Wat- 
kins said that some of your serv- 
ants have publicly stated that yeu 
{shall not be allowed to say by your 
votes whether or not you want this 
plan. What kind of meat do these 
Caesars feed on that they brazenly say 
to their masters: 

“*You must keep quiet; we will 
think and act for you; you are not in- 
telligent enough to know what is best 
for you. These gentlemen have failed 
so far to present other plan. . If 
they trust the people, let them stop 
their criticisms and present something 
eonstructive, and then let you and 
others who pay * taxes say what is 
wanted.” 

In his opening N the council- 
man declared that the neglect of pa- 
triotie men to be vigilant in the serv- 
ice of their country means the loss of 
the power to control their servants, 
who have been employed to do the 
public's business. 

Will Think He Is Master. 

“If citizens like you do not make 
their wishes known,” he said, “the 
servant win think he is master and 
will arrogantly tell you that you can 
have no voice in the rules for running 
your business. There have been more 
than thirty amendments to the char- 
ter which fixes the powers the city of 
Atlanta exercises over her people, and 
you and other private citizens have 
had no voice in deciding what any one 
of these amendments should have been. 

“The Atlanta plan is democratic. 
You elect ‘the controlling officers, the 
mayor and aldermen, and you can dis- 
charge them by a simple method of 
the recall. These officers, your serv- 
ants, can’ not give away the fran- 


W. | chises of your eity, beeause you can by 


the referendum veté any 
grant of a franchise. 
“These servants can not tax you be- 
yond the present tax rate unless you 
are willing. Neither these servants 
nor their agents can waste your mon- 
ey, because a bonded controller can 
prevent, and if he does not prevent 
such waste, you can make the bond 
company pay you your losses, 
“Citizens are given the right, which 
they do not now have, to sue for the 


improper 


use of the city and require misspent 


money to be returned to be used in 
serving you. Another protection the 
Atlanta ‘plan gives you is the require- 
ments that published reports be made 
and an annual audit had. Not only 
does the plan protect you; it returns 
power to the people that has been 
taken from them.” 
Can Initiate Amendments. 

Mr. Watkins urged his hearers not 

to let selfish interests take from them 
the chance to say what kind of char- 
ter they wished. Explaining specific 
advantages of the Atlanta plan, he 
said that “if after trial you should 
want to change it you will not have 
to beg your servants’ permission, for 
the plan gives the people the right to 
initiate any amendment they wish. 
Democracy runs all through this 
plan.“ 
The councilman dwelt at some 
length on the provision made in the 
charter for the public schools, and on 
the functions of the proposed chief of 
administration, who, he said, “would 
have to make good or get out.” In 
his concluding statement he asserted 
that adoption of the Aflanta plan 
would save the city of Atlanta not 
less than $1,000,000 annually in cash, 
and more than that in better service. 
Mr. Watkins will speak Tuesday 
before the Lions’ club on the mibject 
of the Atlanta charter plan. 


URGES EMPLOYMENT 
OF RESDENT LABOR 


Rev. J 


n W. Ham, pastor of the 
Baptist Tabernacie, in his sermon 
Sunday night, urged that Atlanta's 
bond commission use its authority to 
require the employment of local labor 
on the bond issue projects that are 
soon to be started. 

“There may be here and there an in- 
stance where a special expert artisan 
will have to be imported,” said Mr. 
Ham, “but 95. per cent of the work 
can be done by our native help. The 
bond commission can protect our home 
people by having a clause in each con- 
tract specifically requiring employ- 
ment of resident labor. Each person 
offering a bid should be informed that 
such requirement on the part of the 
successful bidder is included in the 
contract. é 

“It is natural for the bond com- 
mission to want to expend public 
money in an economical way, and it 
is natural for contractors to make 
bids based on the cheapest labor, but 
we have a situation here that we should 
protect. The people of Atlanta voted 
the money to carry on the construc- 
tion. Now let the people of Atlanta 
furnish the labor for such construc- 
tion, and the bond commission will 
have the everlasting thanks of all cit- 
izens for service faithfully and justly 
performed.”

Chicago, es 8.—The prohibi- 


tion law is not a failute, and while 
enforcement of 1 probably never will 
reach the 100 per cent point of effi- 
ciency, it rapidly is approaching the 


highest possible point, Major KR A. 


Haynes, national! prohibition director, 
said today in an address before the 
Law Enforcement League of Chicago, 

No law can be enforced 1 per 
cent, Mr. Haynes said. He declared 
that the cnief obstacles in enforcement 
of the Volstead act were apathetic 
citizens and lethargic public officials. 

“The ‘wets’ have spread carefully 
planned propaganda to make it appear 
the prohibition law is a failure and 
cannot be enforced,” said r 
Haynes. They put in capital let- 
ters liquor imported into this country. 
The facts show that the total importa- 
tion during the past fiscal year were 
vne-half of 1 per cent of the total 
consumption of liquor in the United 
States the year before prohibition. 

Propaganda gays crime has in- 
ereased since prohibition, Facts show 
that the crinie wave is world-wide, 
and that it would be just as sensible 
o blame it on woman suffrage as on 
prohibition. Facts show thut 
rests for drunkenness have decreased 
GO per cent in this country since prohi- 
bition ard convictions for drunkenness 
inerersed about the seme per cent in 
wet Fneland. 


“Bocts show that licuor withdrawal 


from warehorees in this cahster dur

cent of the ~'thdrawals in the- pre- 
vious October.” :

Dr. Julio ‘Bianchi, minister of the 
Herrera government to Washington,

fusing to surrender the legation ar- 
chives to representatives of the de

came into power following the revolu- 
tion of December 6. 

In his statement Dr. Bianchi asserts 
that “neither Orellana nor his agents 
have legal auttority to ‘take posses- 
sion of the legations, and points out 
that the diplomatic representatives of 
the Herrara government in France, 
Mexico, Nicaragua. Honduras, El Sal- 
vador and Costa Rica have followed 
his example in refusing to surrender 
their archieves to agents of the de facto 
government He asserte that the Je- 
erations and consulate officers will con- 
tinne to function ns in the past” and 


declares that he will take orders only |

Credit to America 
For Allied Victory 


Paris, January 8—America is giv- 
en full credit for her part in the world 
war in a book devoted to the struggle 
written by Adolfo Agroic, of Monte- 
video. One of the prominent French 
commanders quoted in the book is Gen- 
eral Sarrail, who fought at Verdun 
in 1916, and who later commanded al-: 
tied forces at Saloniki. 

“The Americans won the war,” Gen- 


eral Sarrail is quoted as declaring. | 


‘Had the United States not intervened 
in 1917 we would have lost.”

The author of the book devotes some | 


space to a discussion of international 
relations. 

South America’s policy toward Eu- 
repe.” he declares, must be that of 
the United States. We-must not for- 
get that the Monroe dectrine, pro- 
claimed upon the threshold of our in- 
dependence, was the only measure 
which saved us from becoming Euro- 

eam colonies. Without the United 
States, the South American republics 
could not exist.”

City Commission No New Thing. 

Those who have an idea that the 
commission form of government for! 
Decatur is something new are to be 
informed that on the contrary it is 
very ancient, the city government 
being vested in the hands of five 
commissioners appointed by legisla- 
tive enactment which brought the town 
into existence December 10, 1823 

This form of government continued 
for more than fifty years, and a 
change is said to have been brought 
about as follows: 

The commissioners having set up 
wooded stocks in the courthouse! 
square, were wont to punish every 
petty offense by pinionin ulprits 
therein who were subjected 95 ndigni- 
tres which were not easily forgotten, 
consisting not only of th unts of 
idle spectators and the sm ring of 
their person and clothes with mud by 
the coarser sort, but by worse effects 
of missiles thrown by others to satis- 
iy a grudge against the unlucky vie- 
t'm.

OF DRY LAWS 
WILL BE TRIED 


1 Ga., January 8.— (Special) 
Many cases involving alleged viola- 
tions of the state prohibition laws. 
and a large civil docket, many of 
which cases are of importance, will 
be tried at the January term of the 
city court of Sparta, which will be 
convened Monday morning by ta 
Robert H. Lewis. 


The large criminal docket is madi 
up principally of cases ‘transferred 
from the September adjourned term. 
Officers of the court expect the en- 
tire week will be required to dispose 
of the aecumulated business. 


This also was the otigin of Decatur

Excuse the digression. ‘That very 
night the commissioners, who were ac- 
customed to hear the watchman call

well,“ with astonishment heard him 
cry, “Ten o’clock and bad news!“

the old regulations remained, the last

HUNT THE PAN. 

Dear Sneezy: Oh, boy, we had 
some time! Me and Al saw Wiscon- 
sin and Chicago play foetball. It 
was all because it was Al’s birthday, 
and he could have a new sweater, or 
a pair of skates, but he said he would 
not want even the best thing in the 
world if he could see a big football 
game. So his dad said all right, 
That's how he got to go, but 1 got to 
go by saving up from doing errands 
and helping do dishes. 

Miss Newberger was in Chicago 
and Al and I went on the train and 
she met us and we all went to the 
game. Gee, but it was peachy. Chi- 
eago beat and this was a great sur- 
prise, only it was a goal from the 
field and not a touchdown. 

I was for Wisconsin and we both 
had arm bands on— Wisconsin ones— 
and we rooted for them, but it was 
no good. : 

We almost didn’t see the game, for 
when it started everybody stood up, 
and me and Al was too small to see, 
and so we sneaked down and got way 


thing. It ended 3 to 0, but this does 


have a pail put over his head, and that 


in front, where we could see every- 


at Kansas City, which is in Missouri, 
and he called the game Hunt the Pan, 
and this is the way you play it: 


more healthy 
When the two kids have the pails over 


not make ‘‘hicago champs, because 
Iowa was better than any team even 
in the whole country, 1 guess. It beat 
Notre Dame, and you know how good 
they was. Dad says that the west 
kind of made the east sit up and take 
notice when it comes to football. 
Say, Sneesy, how do you like par- 
ties with girls there? We had one 
at school and the teacher gave us a 
new game, and it’s one that she got 
from the Play Man. You know the 
new Doc is always giving us kids new 
games. Well, he told Miss Smith 
about one that he taught to the girls 
and boys in the school for the blind 


We had two teams and then a kid

blindfold, and the teacher says it is

their heads, then Miss Smith would 


throw a pan on the floor and the one 


that found it would get a point for 
his team. 3 
This is one game where it is 

to have girls on your team, They 
got better ears than boys. From lis- 
tening so much, I guess, and they 
could do this game good. You should 
see the way Doris Leidel and Grace 
Christianson could seoot and find the 
pan. They was on my team and we 
beat 16 to 9. It would surprise you 
how the pan sounds some wheres else 
from where it is. You can do this 
game at parties, Sneeasy, so e 


and write A pin ay? ee

Play hour in school is liked most 
when there is a new game to be 
played. 

The Play Man's Hunt the 
Pan” is an indoor game especially 
well suited to the school room. But 
it ism’t limited to that. Try it in 
the gym, or clear the furniture out 
of a room and play the game at 
home. —THE EDITOR.

WHAT S WHAT 


By Helen Decie 


If people cannot refrain from talk- 
ing on other subjects while they. are 
playing cards, certainly they should 
not choose to play bridge. This game, 
as every one knows, is based on the 
old-fashioned whist. It is interest- 


ing to recall that its very name is 
derived from the old injunction to 
silence. Wrist!“ an ancient English 
and Irish hush-word, 

There are many other games in 
which the rules of almost silent play 
are not so strict as in bridge-whist, 
and those who must chat during the 
play of hands are advised to confine 
themselves to euchre, hearts, five hun- 
dred, shipwreck, etc. Nothing annoys 
attentive bridge players so much as 
distracting talk, since bridge is a game 
which requires intense mental concen- 
tration. Bridge has an etiquette all 
its own, arranged expressly for the 
benefit of players who find the game 
an intellectual stimulant. To disre- 
gard this etiquette is to spoil the 
interest of their game.

No. 22—Useful Device for Bottie 
Corks. 
Materials needed: Small strip of 


tin. 

Figure 1 shows how to lift the cork 
from the bottle; figure 2 shows shape 
to cut the tin, and figure 3 shows 
the device mounted onto cork. before 
cork is placed into bottle. 

The spurs are bent inward and into 
the cork, about one-fourth distance 
from small end, This prevents con- 
tents of bottle from touching the 
metal. When cork is pulled as shown 
in figure 1, the tin squeezes in on 
the cork and lets air find its Way 
into the bottle, then cork is easily 
removed. LE ROY CRIGLER.

To Raise the Height of a Chair. 
When the baby of the family has 
outgrown his high chair, but is too 
small to reach the table when seated 
on the regular dining room chair, it 
is a simple, matter to raise the height 
of the chair. Get four door bumpers. 
Screw one into the bottom of each 
leg of the chair. Paint them to 
match the color of your chair. In 
this way the little one can comforta- 
bly sit at the table without the nui- 
sance of cushions or books under 
him. Besides you have a high chair 
that matches your furniture.

Just as conditions during the game 
require, the center is either an of- 
fensive or defensive player. When his 
team has the ball he playa on the of- 
fense, but when the opponents secure 
the ball, then he shifts to the defen- 
sive play. Because he does play both 
offensive and defensive, the center 
must be ready for any and every

may be awkward, but constant prac-

that cloth and cloth alone must go 
directly against the bare flesh of the 
neck. Of course, the public might 
have rebelled, but somehow it does 
not. It calls itself free, and yet it 
shows itself bound hand and foot by 
the strange laws that are called 
fashion, which, in its final analysis, 
means the thing that everyone is do- 
ing. 

Years have gone over our heads 
bringing war and peace, famine and 
plenty. nations have fallen and kings 
have lost their thrones under the urge 
of freedom, yet nunftions of women 
have made themselves uglier than na- 
ture intended because their neighbors 
went without their collars. 

Now France puts a collar or two 
on young women. Will the new fash- 
jon thrust the other out of existence? 
One wonders. Collars are costly in 
their facility for accumulating dust 
and soil. They stay clean about a 
minute. When this side of the case 
is brought up, the men enter the dis- 
cussion, What would women do to

substitute organdie for fur. 

Cuffs of this kind are tied in at

Probably the most important posi- 
tion on the basketball team is that 
of center. He is the pivot man of 
the plays. He is to the basketball 
team what the quarterback is to the 
football team—the director of the 
play. 

Generally, the center is a tall man. 
This is so because it usually is more 
N that a tall man, because of his 
height, has more chance to “get the

THE HOUSEHOLD 


Edited by Anne Rittenhouse 


THE FLATTERY WE LIKE. 

If there is one sort of compliment 
that a woman does not grow tired of 
it is the compliments paid to her for 
her good cooking, or to the good cook- 
ing of her cook. And even though it 
is considered bad form to come out 
right at dinner with a compliment con- 
cerning this dish or that t are a 
dozen little ways that the diplomatic 
guest knows of imparting such flat- 
tery. 

Most women in the course of time 
‘| grow weary of compiisnen ts paid to 

their appearance. at is a really 
beautiful woman is sufficiently con- 
vinced of the fact of her beauty to 
find compliments of this sort rather 
tiresome and the woman who is ugly 
is pretty sure to know that such 
compliments are mere flattery. But 
there are two sorts of flattery that 
the mature woman never seems to 
weary of—compliments paid her chil- 
= and com ents paid her cook- 
ng.

well and strong, with money in his 
pocket and all his quota of arms and 
legs. He had no wounds to display 
or hero stories to tell; he was just 
plain Billie Stranger—nothing to brag 
about. 

She noticed his abstraction, but was 
far from fathoming its cause.

._mentals of this new existence. 
Finally, arousing herself from these 
hitter-sweet reflections, Geraldine ask-

ing back?” 
But Billie-hardened bis conscience 


and answered plausibly. He was de- 


termined she should not know the 
truth. There had been mail that day, 


Billie pounded along, keeping Wid- 
ow Green a yard or two behind the 
other horse. He would have consid- 
ered it highly impolite to overtake or 
defeat a lady in any game of her own 
choosing, and Geraldine, parting and 
wind-blown, drew rein at the willows, 
an easy winner. But she was not de- 
ceived by her victory and turned 9 
reproachful face to her contestant. 

“You didn’t try to win.“ she accused 
him. “You held the Widow all the 
time.” 

But he had no answer for this. His 
horse stopped beside her own in the 
fringe of willows, but he had forgot- 
ten the horse race almost before it 
ended. He heard what she said, but 
the importance of their play was wiped 
out in something much bigger—a 
startling thing that drove all other 
thoughts from his mind. 

The willow outlined a water hole 
that was located near the boundary 
line of the Three Nines ; just beyond 
were the foothills, rising rugged and 
bare, soon to lose themselves in the 
inhospitable mountains towering be- 
yond. The fencing here was new, 
part of the job Billie and Desmond 
had worked on a short time before, 
so that his eye at once sought it out. 

But he saw with a quick glance 
that there was no fence where the 
new bright wire had been a few days 


thought they were cuttin’ into me.” 
“And are all the cattle gone?“ cried 
Geraldine pityingly. “Oh, dear, what 
will poor Jack say! He loves those 
white-faces as though they were his 
children.“ 
“It may be they didn’t get any.” 
Billie returned. He was puzzled. Night 
was the time for cutting fences, even 
in such remote places as this, and 
he knew that the wire had been cut 
that day. There were cattle on the 
range in plain view, and if the fence 
had been down that morning when 
they watered, there would have been 
signs of stragglers on the other side. 
There was something truly ominous 
about the procedure, and if Geraldine 
had not been with him, he would have 
searched for the intruders before leav- 
ing the place. But he did not know 
what dangers those low hills with 
their screening bouldets and scrub- 
oak concealed, and he dared not face 
it with the girl unguarded. She 
knew this instinctively and offered to | 
return alone. She was not a coward 
and had an English woman’s disdain 
of retreat. 
“I will ride back and send Jack to 
you,” she said. “It is a shame to let 
them escape.“ 

“They won’t escape,” Billie answer- 
ed briefly. id 1 
ain't safe for you to ride alone.“ 


“And I've already said it 
one of those rare women who find 


“Folks that cut wire in a cow coun- 
try don’t let anything else stop em.“ 
he answered, and the gait of the 
horses brought an end to the subject. 

Billie’s heartw as filled with trou- 
ble. A little while ago the world had 
seemed a fine place to be in. On the 
day he rode over -he ridge with the 
white-faces, life had seemed full and 
promising; that was the day he found’ 
Geraldine waiting for him at home. 


Where had his happiness gone? [ig 
possessions were the same, and Ger- 
aldine was beside him, nearer than 
she had ever been; yet an insidious 
shadow, deepening as it came, had 
crept between him and all the old 
gay, careless ways that had been his. 
‘suie secret he had been keeping from 
her lay heavy on his conscience; he 
was deceiving her, and no matter 
what the object of this deception 
might be, instinct warned that the 
day of explanation must come. And 
the thought of Little Britches was not 
a pleasant one to face. After that, 
the grave proof of the enemy at his 
own gate. 

The ride back to the ranch was 
fast and silent. Geraldine glanced at 
the grim face beside her from time 
to time, but said nothing. She was 


of unsaddling Tomato Can, but at 
Billie’s first words he threw the blan- 
ket on the pinto’s back again, Without 
wasting a word he understood the ne- 
cessity for quick action. With the 
fences down at the willows, a large 
proportion of their stock might easily 
stray into the foothills, and in the 
face of the weather sure to break 
very soon, and with the chances that 
the rustlers were watching for this 
to happen, the odds were against their 
recovery without a loss. 

The two, supplied with pliers, re- 
turned to the break without waiting 
for supper. There were more impor- 
tant things on foot than food or sleep. 
They would have to be satisfied with a 
makeshift job, for there was no new 
wire; neither was there a chance of 
getting any without delay. ' 

Jack surveyed the ruin with jaun- 
diced eyes. 

“Billie,” he said solemnly, “it looks 
like somebody’s shootin’ hand was get- 
tin’ cured up like an’ ready for busi- 

How does it look tuh you?’ 
ell, I was thinkin’ something like 
that myself,” Billie returned equably. 
“He ain't in any hurry to take a pot 


shot at me though. He could have 


had it today if he'd chosen. I reckon 
this sort of dirty work satisfies him, 
maybe.“ 


gettin’ in th’ way.” 

When Billie made no reply, Jack 
went_on, feeling his way over what he 
knew to be ticklish ground. 

“This don’t look exactly like no 
rustler job tuh me—I ain't never seen 
'em come in broad daylight like this. 
It looks more like spite work. Might 
be something a woman was mixed up 
with.” Glancing at his friend he 
changed the subject abruptly. “Guess 
I'll be ridin’ over tuh Duncan’s tomor- 
row about that alfalfa. Looks like we'd 


need more hay. After a long dry 
spell like this there’s sure to be a hell- 


This wis a plan and prediction 
that his friend made each day and Bil- 
lie let it go by without comment. He 
was relieved to find the wire in better 
shape than he had expected, and in an 
haur they were on their way home. 

It was not a dark night, but over 
the high moon there was a faint haze 
that changed the outline of familiar 
things and shrouded distapce with 
mystery. They rode to the st and a 
light wind blowing into their faces

of change; a chill born on the far,

the soft, wild mystery of the night — 
the lonesome range. Suddenly Billie’a 
horse, which was in the lead, swe 
and plunged. Out of the shadows an- 
other horse, silent-footed, was drawn 
for a moment across their path. 

They caught a fleeting glimpse of a 
slim figure crouched upon the animal’s 
withers—the thin features and lumin- 
ous eyes; the tangled hair, golden-red, 
even in the half-light.

His first thought was for his pre- 
cious whlifte-faces. The rustlers had 
been at work here without a doubt, 
and his heart sank at the certainty 
that a portion at least of his stock 
would be missing—and he could not 
afford to lose a single hoof. His lips 
set in a grim narrow line as he 
wheeled his horse toward home and

Football has come to an untimely end, and the result of the long- 


delayed intersectional games proved nothing. Texas A. & M. defeated

it looks as if the claims to consistency 


was not the Centre 


team of the regular season. Washington and 


Jetferson played a scorless tie with California, in a contest which 
proved nothing at all, although it was quite a shock to California’s 


high claims. — 


Neale had his team in condition—or in as good condition as a 
team may be kept over a long period—and he avoided the blunder 
made by both Ohio State and Harvard in going to the coast. 

If anything is proved by these contests, it is that football is a game 


pein in shape on à certain day. 


“in which the greatnéss of a team depends largely upon its luck in 


If it proved aything, it was that 


tre Dame, Penn State and W. and J. were the greatest teams of the 
year because they were always in condition, and the fact that W. 
and J. went throught the California game without a change in the 
line-up is the best testimonial to its condition. 

It is very. evident that California is not quite as great a team 
as it was supposed to be, and that its great success has been due 


in part to the fact that its style was strange to opposing teams.

Neald,

no trouble in balking Muller and his forward passes, and California, 
hitting for the first time a line coached to meet its style of offensive, 


made only few first downs. 


18 SLLINOIS 


MOST CONSISTENT? 
Meantime the football argument con- 
tinues to grow more complicated, and 


will be considered as tests of teams. 
Just now our old friend Mike Tobin 
is proving conclusively that Illinois, 
since the advent of Zuppke, has been 
the best team in the conference. And 
Mike furnishes the figures to back his 
dope, saying: 

‘In the nine years that Bob Zuppke 
has coached football at Illinois, in the 
matter of conference games won and 
lost, he still has the-edge on the Big 


Ten teams which he has met—this de- 


spite the bumps he sustained during 
‘the last season.

plete conference record goes, Illinois

Adding other college games to the

“In these nine years Zuppke has 
won three conference championships 
and tied another. It is histoty that 
he has been fighting near the top in 
seevral other seasons.“ 
BAN JOHNSON’S 
OUTBREAK. 


Ban Johnson’s alleged outbreak 


against Harry Frazee is just the open- 
ing gun, fired a bit prematurely, of the 
inevitable battle in baseball. It was 
not even to be hoped that the truce 
sould be maintained and that Mr. 
Johnson could maintain silence. 
most probable that Mr. Johnson will 
declare he never said that Mr. Frazee 


is the champion wrecker of baseball— 
or that he said it in strict confidence 
and was misquoted. 

The charge that Frazee is the 
champ wrecker is not, however, either 
true or deserved. True he has rather 
smashed up the old Boston outfit, but 
that is not the question. The question 
is whether or not he was justified in 
doing it. Further, it looks as if the 
Boston owner is acting according to 
the desires of his manager, and Duffy 
knows players and whether they are 
working or not. 

Oddly, almost every team with 
which Duffy has been connected has 
had the same outbreaks of factional 
trouble, and each time he has got rid 
of one faction—which, of course, is 
the only way to make a team. He 
knows what he wants in Boston, and 
is getting it. 

Frazee was not a baseball man when 
he gut into the game. The chief ob- 
jection to him was that he was a 
theatrical man. He has learned a lot 
of baseball. In fact, it is doubtful 
whether he would now, make the blun- 
ders he did in his early career. 

It will be considerable of a laugh 


Frazee if the Boston team is up in the 
American league fight next season. In 
spite of the criticism of the trades, it 
looks as if the Boston team will have 
more punch, more power, more speed 
than it has had, and if the team works 
it wiil be a big disturbing factor in 
the race. If it doesn’t work, it will 


be no worse than the teams of the 
last two years have been.

After the game I asked Referee 


Fans what, in his opinion, was its 


outstanding feature. 
there in the swim he got a lot of in- 
side stuff that couldn't be seen from 
the grandstand because of the splash- 


ing. 

„Well,“ said Mr. Evans, the thing 
I noticed most was the cursing. I've 
refereed a lot of games, but I never 
beard anything like it before. Ari- 
rona was just average at cursing. They 
had a few novel expressions from over 
in the horned toad country, but noth- 
ing at all startling to the trained ear. 
1 don’t know but that Stanford or 
some of the coast colleges could have 
said over them a bit in originality and 
emphasis. 

“But Centre! That’s what struck 
me. Not a man in the lineup used a 
gingle cuss word. Bo McMillin did 
ell the cussing for the Centre team. 
I never heard anything like the line 
Bo pulled. The strongest word he 
used was ‘marvellous,’ but every time 
he snapped it out you could see the 
whole Centre team quiver as if he'd 
whiplashed 'em. When he wanted 
variety. hed use the werd Wonderful!“ 
All the cussing I’ve ever heard was 
mild as milk beside the insulting, sar- 
castic bite Bo could put into those two 
words. 

„When Centres line tracked a few 
times in the second half and let Ari- 
zona break through down after down 
to Centre's five-yard line Bo was 
fairly raving. The Arizona bunch

responsible for most of the animal 
mortality—starvation. 

Compressed horse rations which can 
easily be transported have been a 
pressing need for centuries. Napo- 
leon’s campaign against Russia failed 
because of the starvation of the ani- 
‘mals. Only last spring in Mesopota- 
mia the British government was 
obliged to kill 30,000 war horses in 
the last stages of starvation. 


Thrived On It. 


Reports on file at Washington show 


that the Georgia horses thrived. on 
the new ration, and that. several 
marching expeditions were made when 
the horses were fed solely. on the 
forage, which proved satisfactory. 

General William J. Snow, chief of 
artillery, stated that his department 
was taking the ration as a basis for 
further experiment, in an attempt to 
develop a completely satisfactory field 
forage ration for horses as a war time 
proposition, not as an emergency 
ration. 

Until the United States started its 
éxperiments, Germany was the only 
nation using a concentrated bulk form 
of food for its army horses. 

For fifty years United States army 
officers have been endeavoring to solve 
the problem of easily transported 
horse feed. The British supply offi- 
cers in Egypt who were concerned 
with forwarding supplies to the troops 
engaged in the Palestine campaign 
evolved a type of compressed food by 
using cotton baling presses to reduce 
the bulk, and while this was an im- 
provement, it was never quite satis- 
factory. 


CARPENTIER 
FIGHTS SOON 


London, January 8.— Georges Car- 
pentier will have his chance, next 
Thursday afternoon, to demonstrate 
that he is still the man he was about 
3 o’clock in the afternoon of last July 
2 as he sat in his corner, embodying 
every physical gift of nature, waiting 
for the gong. Carpentier has not 
fought since Dempsey’s right fist struck 
him down in that fourth round. Thurs- 
dav he meets George Cook, the Aus- 
tralian, in a 20-round bout at Albert 

a

In the last few months, many re- 
ports have come from France concern- 
ing the after-effects of Jack Demp- 
sey’s terrible punches to the body. It 
was said that Carpentier was subject 
to internal hemorrhages; that he could 
not box three rounds with his. own 
shadow without gasping for breath: 
that his heart“ had been perched out 
in that terrific beating. Carpentier's 
right hand, which he splintered against 
Dempsey’s jaw in the second round, 
also has been a doubtful. weapon and. 
although Georges, himself, has claimed 
that it is completely healed, followers 
of the boxing game have been watch- 
ing him eritfeally in training to observe 
whether he “favored” that lame fist. 
Says He Is All Right. a 

Carpentier has told many of his 
English friends that the hand is all 
He insists, too, that he was 
not permanently burt by the body 
But there is a strong belief 
among followers o fthe game that 
Georges has suffered at least a sharp 
slump from the top of his morale; has 
lost that confidence which gave him 
the audacity to tackle the man-killer 
in Jersey City, not as a human sacri- 
fice, after the loser’s end, but as a 
real challenger for the championshfp. 

He has been wearing a_ football 
headgear in training because of an ex- 
crescence on the left side of his face 
which has now almost disapeared. 

Cook, who is a durable, strong slug- 
ger, without much knowledge of or re- 
gard for the finer points of boxing, 
will weigh about 187 pounds, and Car- 

entier about 174. Carpentier is a 

tter puncher than Cook, but the 
Australian is said to be a rugged re- 
ceiver, with strong knees in a storm 
of punches. 

Carpentier is doped to win the 
fight. Cook is given a chance if he 
can keep away from the Frenchman 
for five rounds. There is little bet- 
ting, and that is done at 7 to 4 on 
Carpentier. 
~ Regardless of the outcome of this 
fight, Carpentier's match with Ted 
Kid Lewis, holder of the British wel- 
ter, middle and light-heavyweight ti. 
tles, for the heavyweight championship 
of Europe, will stand. The Frenchman 
thus postpones still further into the 
indefinite future his proposed match 
with Tom Gibbons for the light-heavy. 
weight championship of the world.

fine financial asset—in the family. 
Benny has a younger brother, Joe 
Leonard, who has been boxing in gym-

“He has more natural speed and 
fighting ability than I ever had when 
I was working my way to the top,” 
Benny told me. He's better built, 
and he can box and hit like a cham- 
pion right now.” 

Benny discouraged Joe's ambition 
to begin fighting at a tender age. He 
wants his brother to have a fair 
education, and, having gone through 
the fighting mill, Benny knows how 
many chances for failure here are, 
and how few for success. 

There was brother Charlie, for in- 
stance. Charlie was a corking. ama-

a quick, clean one-punch knockout, 
and looked like k world beater. But,

Plan for Indianapolis Fvents 


BY THOMAS HA 


Tenth Year for Racing Classic 


Indianapolis, Ind., January 8.— 
(Special.) — For the tenth time the 


Indianapolis motor speedway will 
stage its 500-mile international sweep- 


stakes, May 30, on the 2½-mile brick 
oval, which has made the Hoosier 
capital city famous internationally. 
As in previous years,“ the race carries 
the largest cash award of the season 
for an automobile speed contest, with 
$50,000 total and $20,000 to the 
winner. 

Ten times in the last twelve years 
the speed kings of the gasoline world 
have contested for the honor of win- 
ning an igternational race, and in 
the ten ents no driver has been 
able to repeat, and have the honor 
of twice winning the event, something 
no other speed classic is distinguish- 
ed by. The race has grown from a 


domestic affair in 1911, with none 


but American pilots contesting,.to the 
greatest event of the season and the 
cream of European teams as contest- 
ants. The lapse of two years in the 
running of the Indianapolis classic is 
due to the warld war, as races were 
not conducted in 1917 and 1918. 
Entry Blanks Mailed. y 


Entry blanks have been placed in 
the mails by the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway company, and responses 
from. American and foreign drivers are 
expected daily, as it is always a con- 
test, especially among the American 
pilots, to have ‘the honor of carrying 
the No. 1 in the race. Conditions for 
the race are the same as in 1920, and 
last year, with the maximum engine 
size placed at 183 cubic inches, How- 
ever, the weight conditions differ from 
foreign years and foreshadow the com- 
petition of what a decade ago would 
have been scorned as minlature en- 
gines. 5 pe sy 

The maximum piston displacement 
ears, that is cars up to 188 cubic 
inches, and not less than 128 cnbic 
inches, is 1,650 pounds minimum.with- 
out gasoline, oil, or ballast. of any 


kind. For the driver entering a car 
in the 2-litre class, i. e., 122 cubic 
inches engine content or under, new 
weight conditions have been an- 
nounced this year. The engine of 92. 
122 cubic inches rates a minimum 
weight of 1,400 
with engines of 911-2 cubic inches 
zor less can start with a minimum 
weight of 1,200 pounds, 
Rigid Requirements. 

The usual rigid requirements mak- 
ing it impossible for a physically un- 
fit driver to start are incorporated 
in the entry blank, in the s1ppi2ment- 
ary conditions to the A. A. A. con- 
test board’s rules and regulations. It 
is provided that in event of rain 
May 30 the race will be run ou May 
31. Entries will be accepted. up to 
midnight on May 1. Racing has al- 
ways been the crucible in which the 
mechanisms of the motor car has been 
refined. This is the last year that 
engines as large as the lord’s power 
plant will be permitted to race for 
an aggregate purse of more than 
$100,000, including the speedway’s 
$50,000. Eleven years ago the race 
started for engines of not more than 
600 cubic inches piston displacement, 
but was reduced for 1913 and 1914 to 
a 450 maximum, The cars showed too 
much speed, and the speedway man- 
agement cut the displacement to 300 
cubie inches, her it rested from 
1915 to 1919. In 1920 the present 3- 
litre or 183-cubie-inch class was in- 
augurated. Next year’s race will be 
for 2-litre engines, or 122-cubic-inch 
maximum. 

The entry blank shows in addition 
to the cash prizes two famous 
trophies—the Prest-O-Lite silver brick 
to the driver leading at 300 miles and 
the Wheeler-Schebler cup, the largest 
silver trophy in existence, to the lead- 
er at miles. The $50,000 purse 
is divided as follows: $20,000, 810.

RUTH’S VALUE 
IN SCORING 


George Ruth crossed the plate 178 
times last season and by scoring that 
many runs the great batsman created 
a new record in scoring runs for the 
modern day piayers. The best mark 
since 1900 was made by Ruth in 1920 
when he put over 158 runs. Last 
season he scored 178 in 152 games, a 
remarkable record. 


The best record in run-getting was 
made by Billy Hamilton, of the Phil- 
edelphia Nationals, in 1894, when that 
fleet-footed athlete crossed the plate 
196 times in the 131 games he played. 
No players have these records ap- 
proached. The Lathams, Stoveys, 
Kellys, Deffys, Keelers of the old 


school, and Ty Cobb, Davy Fultz, Ed- 
die Collins and Larry Lajoie, of the 
modern school, in putting over an un- 
usual number of runs per season, all 
fall short of the wonderful Ruth in 
scoring runs. 

Ruth has led all major league play- 
ers in scoring runs in the past three 
seasons with 103 in 1919, 158 in 1920, 
and in 1921 he put over the second 
best work in rungetting in the history 
Gf baseball. Here is a list of play- 
ers who scored 150 or more rung in 
A season since 1885:

for the annual meeting of the stew- 
ards tomorrow and Tuesday to assign 
dates for 1922 meetings. Horsemen 
in the Lake Brie circuit (half-mile 
tracks), will meet Wednesday to allot 
dates, 

President H. K. Devereaux, of the 

rand Circuit, will not be able to 
attend the meetings, Secretary Win 
H. Kinnan announced today. 

Detroit, formerly one of the great- 
est Grand Circuit cities, will probably 
be a member of the circuit again this 
year, it was said tonight with the 
arrival here of William Penfield, sec- 
retary of the Detroit Driving club, 
who will tomorrow make application 
for membership to conduct a meet- 
ing at the Devonshire track at Wind- 
sor, Ont., opposite Detroit. en- 
ilworth track at Windsor is also an 
applicant for dates, according to 
President Samuel McBride, of that 
track. 

Kenilworth and Windsor tracks are | 
separated by a road and as a result 
it is possible that a compromise may 
be reached and that instead of being 
rivals both tracks may be given dates 
and work in harmony in a nine-day or 
two-weeks meet. Under the Canadian 
laws any harness horse race meet is 
curtailed to three days in one week 
at the same track. To comply with 
the law a schedule may be arranged 
to race the first three days of a week 
at one of the Windsor tracks and the 
last three at the other. Both tracks 


i are mile ovals.

Madge Kennedy (Herself ). 


(At the Atlanta Theater.) 
It is not only a privilege, but a 


rare distinction for an actor or ac- 
tress to retire from the stage at the 
heighth of success, enter film cir- 
cles, attain another wonderful tri- 
umph and then return to the stage 
and repeat the first success. To 
Madge Kennedy this has happened. 
When she left the stage three years 
ago, it was right at the time when 
“Fair and Warmer” and “Twin 
Beds” were tremendous box office 
attractions. At the expiration of 
her film contract Miss Kennedy 
placed herself under the manage- 
ment of Colonel Henry W. Savage, 
who submitted to the young star, 
the manuscripte of “Cornered,” a 
four-act comedy-drama by D 
Mitchell. She was delighted with 
the story, and the personality of its 
heroine go ideally fitted her that she 
informed Mr. Savage it would not 
be necessgry to look further for a 
play, as she considered “Cornered” 
far superior to the hundred or more 
she had read, in anticipation of her 
return to the speaking stage. “Cor- 
nered’’ was produced at the Astor 
theater, New York, last December, 
and was an instantaneous sucoess, 
running well into the summer, be- 
fore closing, in order that Miss 
Kennedy might make an Icelandic 
voyage. The original cast will ap- 
pear in support of the star, when 
the attr#tion comes to the Atlanta 
theater tonight. 


“The Right Girl.” 
(Coming te the Atlanta.) 


An attraction of unusual merit 
will be “The Right Girl,“ America’s 
foremost musical show,” which will 
be seen at the Atlanta theater on 


„ New 
. It is gaid to be something 
delightfully different from any past 
or present musical comedy. The 
scenes are laid in New York and 
Palm Beach. Throughout the play 
there are fourteen catchy musical 
numbers. These, together with an 
ensemble of a most delightful cho- 
rus, lend charm and beauty to the

Loew Vaudeville. 
(At the Grand.) 


“Songs and Dances,” a pretentious 
musical offering presented by A. I. 
Feinberg, is the featured attrac- 
tion on the vaudeville bill at Loew's 
Grand theater beginning today. Five 
talented ＋ participate in ‘thie 
novel song sketch, introducing pop- 
ular and character songs and lots 
of comedy. Special scenery is nec- 
essary, as the skit is. presented in 
three spectacular scenes. 

Burns and Klei an added at- 
traction, are two clever comedians 
with bundles of laughs. They style 
themselves “Assassins of grief and 
remorse.” Other acta are Homer 
Miles and company in a clever char- 
acter playlet, “The Rough Neck: 
Mann and Mallory in a comedy turn, 
and Alvin and Alvin in difficult 
balancing. 

Gareth Hughes is to be the star 
of the screen, appearing in “The 
Hunch,” a hilarious comedy drama. 


“The Little Minister.” 
(At the Criterion) 

Great care was taken in selecting 
the cast for The Little Minister, 
which will be shown at the Cri- 
terion theater this week. Vitagraph 
selected Alice Calhoun because 
nature of her physical beauty and 
mental makeup she is the ideal 
Lady Babbie. e possesses just the 
grace of witchery which has made 
the character of Babbie beloved by

Leonard started touring the coun. 


try—barnstorming at catch-weigiits. 
He went to Milwaukee to fight Pinkie 
Mitchell a no-decision go. No-decision 
things are soft. Pinkie got an acute 
uttack of dandruff and the Miiwau- 
kee commission cancelled the match.

Leonard was matched with Joe Well- 
ing in New Orleans. This too, way 
cancelled. Leonard’s score was; 
Matches, 2; cancellations, 2; profit, 
nothing, minus expenses to Milwaukee. 
Nobody 
the money Rickard can pay for a 
championship fight and no champion 
will take less than the utmost pe 
sible purse. Britton certainly wonk 
not risk his title in one of the skatit 
rink clubs about town. So his part 


of the boycott was called off. Now he 
is signed to fight the younger of the 


Shade brothers of California, in the 
Garden this month. Jack Perry, of 
Pittsburg, first got this match, but 
Leo P. Flynn is matchmaker of the 
Garden and en By of Shade, so 
Perry was wronged from the start. 
nn sends in his own boys when- 
ever a spot shows up on the bill. 
Now, one hears, Leonard can be 
rsuaded to transfer the Pinkie 
itchell match to the Garden where 
he knocked out Pinkie’s older brother, 
Richie, the lightweight, last winter. 
Pinkie is a 2 


May Abroad. 

Johnny Cheese got his $35,000 from 
R'ckard in return for signing articles 
io fight Harry Greb to a decision for 
the middleweight title. Then he ran 
out of the articles, whereupon the New 
York commission and the com- 
mission, with swell unanimity, socked 
the Cheddar champion with an indefi- 
nite suspension. 

Now Wilson is receiving messages 
from Gus Wilson, no relation, who 
was Georges Carpentier’s rubber at 
Manhasset, offering large bouquets of 
francs for some fights. in Franee, 
where they know and appreciate real 
fromage. Being unable to gather 
any of this easy money at home, Wil- 
son may have to go abroad. But this 
talk of Johnny's being broke or losing. 
heavily in Wall street, sounds like 
sodafountain gossip to those who know 
him. Johnny is a connoisseur of 
first mortgages and owns plenty.

a teen years ago is today America’s one billionaire? 


A tax report has figured what that $76,000,000 in taxes paid for 1920 
represents, and his finding is that Mr. Ford’s income for the year in 
question was $103,050,240.10. That would mean about $282,329 a day, 
Sundays and holidays included. 

But is Mr. Ford a billionaire? Opinions differ as to what consti- 
tutes a billionaire or a millionaire. A man with an income of $103,- 
050,240.10 a year might be considered a billionaire by some persons, but, 
after paying $76,000,000 out of his income to the government, he would 
have only $27,000,000 left, and that is not consistéhat with a billionaire

| Swift Inventory Loss $20,000,000 in Year 


Chicago, January 7.—Loss in inventory values of Swift & Co. 
amounted to $20,000,000 in 1921, Louis F. Swift, president of the com- 
pany, told the annual meeting of shareholders a few days ago. 

“However, during the prosperous years of the war,” Mr. Swift con- 
tinued, we provided for the serious decline by appropriating large 
amounts to surplus to maintain the company, enabling it to continue the 
payment of regular dividends. We paid dividends of 8 per cent, amount- 
ing to $12,000,000. The prospects are that Swift & Co. will continue 
payment of 1 

Mr. Swift stated that gross sales during the year were slightly 
more than 3800, 000, 000, which was a reduction from the previous year. 
The 1920 sales were slightly more than $1,100,000,000. The decrease in 
tonnage, he said, was only about 6 per cent. 

Wages were reduced 22 1-2 per cent, 12 1-2 per cent in March and 
10 per cent more in November, he announced. 

The balance sheet of the company on November 5, 1921, showed a 
surplus of $61,739,991; capital stock at $150,000,000 and total liabilities, 
including capital -stock and surplus, of $361,843,866,

oldest in Atlanta, having been estab- 


lished since 1881. During their long 
years of experience they have acquired 
the latest and most scientific methods 
of storing, moving and packing. 

There are a number of unique and 

exclusive features in connection with 
the service rendered by the progres- 
sive eoncern, and for none of those do 
they make any added charge to their 
patrons. Among them is the use of 
especially constructed boxes for the 
storage of small articles, such as bric- 
a-brac, pictures, books, etc.; special 
cartons for mattresses, pillows, etc.; a 
special room for the. storage of rugs 
and carpets, where they are fumigat- 
ed regularly every ten days, keeping 
them free from moths, vermin, inseets, 
etc.; pianos are also stored in a spe- 
cial room, where they get plenty of 
sunshine and air, so necessary to the 
life and preservation of a piano; all 
trunks are stored in a special room, 
so they may be readily available for 
patrons at any time; they have a spe- 
cial woman attendant for ladies. 
During their steady growth, which 
began in a very modest. wooden struc- 
ture at the corner of Spring and Simp- 
son streets, they have not failed to 
equip themselves with the latest build- 
ing facilities. Their pre®ent location 
at 235-237-239-241 Edgewood avenue, 
a building of concrete construction 
throughout, absolutely mouse and rat 
proof, and all goods stored are covered 
with heavy sheeting as a protection 
from dust. In the past several months 
they have a new building, 135-137 Bell 
street, which gives them a total stor- 
age space of 75,000 square feet, equiv- 
alent to fifteen floors 50x10U feet. 
The company claims to have the 
lowest insurance rates of any furni- 
ture warehouse in the city. 
Officials of the company are John 
J. Woodside, Sr., president; John J. 
Woodside, Jr., vice president and gen- 
eral manager; F. A. Bumstead, secre- 
tary and treasurer. 

John J. Woodside, Jr., states that 
after a sound business in the past year 
they are expecting a record year for 
1922. An invitation is extended to the 
public at all times to visit their ware- 
houses, which are always clean and 
open to inspection. 


Rittenbaum Bros. 
Have Big Business 


On Wiping Cloths 


Rittenbaum Bros., who conduct an 
up-to-date. laundry in this city for, 
washing wiping cloths, have a busi- 
ness which stands out unique in the 
place it fills in industrial Atlanta. 

They are located at 472-478 De- 
catur street, in a most commodious 
building. Twenty years ago they 
started in a small way on Peters 
street. 

By persistent effort, by producing 
meritorous commodity, it grew stead- | 
ily along, until now these brothers 
own their own buildings on Decatur 
street. 

These cloths are handled with the 
Same care and go through the same 
process as clothes are handled in a 
laundry, and when their wiping cloths 
are handled in sanitary packages, 
ready for the trade, they are declared 
to be absolutely germ proof. 

A well-known trade mark: “Nun- 
Better Wiping Cloths”—is used by 


line of Whitman’s candies, such as 
small package goods, marshmallows, 
peppermints, etc., and have built up 
a large trade on this line. With 
quick turn-overs the company assures 
its trade at all times that all candies 
shipped by it is just as fresh and nice 
as goods of this kid can be made. It 
carries, in addition, a general line of 
fine candies, being one of the best 
known candy jobbing concerns in the 
south. 

Five salesmen are kept constantly

Miller Lumber Co. 
Furnishes Everything 
For the Home Builder 


For four years the Miller Lumber 
company, of this city, has been sery- 
ing a fast-growing trade, and their 
many satisfied customers are their 
best guarantee of the service they 
offer the public. 

The company was organized by W. 
D. Miller and Joseph A. Willingham, 
both experienced men in the lumber 
business. Each year has shown a 
splendid grcwth in business over the 
year previous, the business for last 
year being especially a large improve- 
ment over that of 1919. The company 
is expecting a large increage for 1922 
over 1921. 

This company is able to furnish 
everything for the home builder. Giv- 
ing a square deal to everyone, aug- 
mented by prompt service and quality 
in goods, has drawn to the company 
a large list of customers. 

Some of the things the Miller Lum- 
ber company can furnish the home- 
builder is lumber, sash, doors, mold- 
ings, shingles, laths, roofings, lime. 
cement, plaster, wall board, paints and 
varnishes and builders’ hardware. 

One of the recent splendid —— 
of the eity in which this co — — tur- 
nished everything in the woodwork ex- 
cept the millwork is the new Clark 
university building. This is a hand- 
some L-shaped brick building, of 40 
rooms, with chapel, gym and swim- 
ming pool. The interior and exterior 
is handsomely painted, everything 
harmoniously matched and the floors 
are covered with wood filler and dura- 
ble floor varnish. The building con- 
tains 150,0000 face brick and cost 
completed about $200,000.

(Copyright, 1922, for The Consti- 
tution.) 


Washington, January 8.—Political 
questions attachi to the proposed 

5 1 of 1 
Will Hays that be may become di- 
rector general of the motion picture 
industry may be a determining factor 

* his consideration of the movie of- 

¢ er. 

There is no doubt that implications 
raised by Senator Pat Harrison in a 
Speech Saturday have brought home 
to Hays the possible embarrassments 

58 he might bring to his party, as well 
3 to himself, in accepting the movie 


Hays maintains, however, that po- 
litical considerations do not and could 
not enter in any way his contemplated 
new work. A job, he believes, can 
be made just as big as the man holding 
it wishes to make it. ‘To succeed in 
this new job and to accomplish the 
big work it comprehends, 1 naturally 
could not afford and certainly would 
not do 8 that would be in- 
strumental in destroying the purposes 
es was striving for. 
Must Lean Backwards. 
“Tf there were the slightest polit- 
ical 3 in my work, or the slight - 
is for suspieion that political 
— were being served, it would make 
it impossible for me to do the things 
I would wish to do. For that reason, 
Uunturully, it would be absolutely nec- 
essary tor me to stand so straight as 
to lean backwards in my determina- 
tion to avoid anything that smacked 
of political designs.“ 

Hays does not believe that the cir- 
cumstances of his movie offer require 
‘any defense. He-regards as a suffi- 
cient answer to Senator Harrison the 
very fact that his work with the mo- 
tion picture industry would crumble 
to pieces if in any way he sought to 
make it a political influence. 

1 there are these ele- 
ments which have to be considered, 
because they have been raised by Sen- 
“ator Harrison, and may therefore be 
regarded as a forerunner of the 
thought democratic leaders will em- 
phusize upon occasions if Hays takes 
ry the movie job: 

Pending Problems. 

1. “There is now before the senate 

finance committee the question of im- 
osing or retaining a tariff upon films 
mported into this country.’ 

2. The federal trade commission is 
now threatening an investigation into 
some of the motion picture concerns. 

3. “The motion picture industry is 
battling the constant threat of a fed- 
eral censorship law and if such a law 
were passed it would be passed by the 
now overwhelming republican house 
and senate.” 

So Harrison raises this question: 

“Is it because the motion picture in- 
dustry might have a weather eye out 
on that tariff proposition or the fed- 
eral trade commission's investigation 
and they think that Hays might be in- 
> fluential because of his closeness to 
certain senators here, or to representa- 

tives in the other body, or to certain 

members of the federal trade commis- 
sion, or to. the present president of the | 

‘United States, that he is selected?” 


Obvious Implication. 


The implication is quite obvious— 
and the thought carries potential em- 
barrassments both for Hays and the 
administration, Democrats point out 
that the motion picture industry is a 
greater force than newspapers today ; 
that the director general 1 the indus- 
try would have a power greatcr even 
than a theoretical stper-counsel who 
might direct the policies of the com- 
bined newspapers of the nation. 

So there is no doubt that democrats 
would watch carefully and with sus- 
picion the activities of a man whose 
a political ingenuity is recognized in both 

parties, whose organizing ability has 
won him fame and whose contemplated 
new job would place him in a posi- 
tion of power, the influence of which 
could be made more far-reaching than 
any other single medium in the coun-

That he will accept the movie 
555 is believed certain by his friends. 
He personally would like to do so, see- 
ing in the new position an opportunity 
for doing what to his mind is perhaps 
the most constructive work now pos- 
sible in a moral and educational way. 
In reaching his final conclusion he will 
confer with President Harding and 
members of his own family and have 
an official statement ready by the end 
of the week.

Republic Charges 


Tokio, January 8-—(By the Asso- 
ciated ‘Press. )—"P erpl 
ension in the face of the al- 


terization given by the foreign j 
in a statement today in reply to the 
1 made by the representatives of 
the Far 


ton, with regard to Japan's activities 
in Siberia. 


The statement says the documents 
— regard to a Franco-Japanese 


— malicious falsehoods, 
ernment never having engaged in ne- 
gotiations of the nature alleged. It 
that in November, when a 
portion of the documents was pub- 
lished by an agency of the soviet gov- 
ernment the Japanese government 
strongly protested through its dele- 
gates at the Dairen conference and 
that the publishing of the notes again 
constitutes “a malignant national 
crime.” 

What has been done at Vladivostok, 
says the statement, has been in com- 
pliance with the request of the local 
consular body. 

The minimum of men under arms 
necessary for the maintenance of or- 
der and a fixed number of private po- 
lice have been furnished. It is mbso- 
lutely untrue that troops have ever 
been supplied to the White army. 

In refutation of the ¢harge that the 
Japanese at the Dairen conference 
made demands calculated to give con- 
trol of the Far East to Russia, the 
statement says Japan has no other de- 
sire than to obtain assurance of the 
security of life and property of the 
Japanese and the elimination of dan- 
ger to communication and the menace 
to Japanese. 

“Japan has no other desire,” says 
the statement, “except that the Kus- 
sians cease their internal strife and 
that peace and order shal] be estab- 
lished in the Far East of Russia, as 
goon as possible, in order that Japan 
may withdraw her troops with a sense | 
of relief.” 


Bray Is Caught. 


Athens, Ga., January 8.—(Special.)

ed by the last grand jury of the su- 
perior court for selling illicit liquor,

10878 Washington, January 8.—It would 
3272 be difficult, but not impossible, to de- 
termine and to administer “offsetting 
import duties” against the varying 
exchange rates in foreign countries, 
the United States tariff commission 
says in a special report on depreci- 
ated exchange and international trade, 
made public today. This is one of 
the plans that has been suggested be- 
fore the senate finance cammittee for 
meeting the unusual brought about by 
the difference of exchange as between 
the United States and the various 
countries from which goods are 
brought to this country. 

“A flat rate can not be applied be- 
cause of the varying degrees of de- 
pression of exchange in different coun- 
tries,” the commission says, “but a list 
of commodities for which special pro- 
tection is sought could be prepared 
and revised from time to time.” 

The commission says that its in- 
quiry developed that in Germany there 
is yet a great discrepancy between the 
internal value of the mark and its gold 
value—sligrtly more than two to one 
in 1921. 

“The prices of specific commodities 
in various countries tell roughly the 
same story” the report continues. “The 
gold prices of copper, wheat and wool 
are about the same in the United 
States, Eng'and and France, with les 
ser degrees of adjustment for Ger- 
many. Specialities, however, euch as 
articles of fashion or -complicated 
chemical and metallurgical products, 
are often priced locally in Eusspe in 
terms of paper money with the result 
that special bargains may be had by 
American buyers because of low rates 
of exchange This bonus on exports 
from central Europe is partly offset 
by the numerous restrictions to trade 
in exportable products. 

“A comparison of wages in the 
United States, England, France and 
Germany shows that they are less ad- 
zusted to a goid basis than are prices. 
In May, 1921, the standard wage in 
Germany for factory workers was, 
roughly, 10 cents per hour in gold as 
compared with 20 cents to 25 cents in 
France, 30 cents to 40 cents in Eng- 
land and 50 cents to 75 cents in the 
United States.”

As symptomatic of the strength in 
prices in December, it might be noted 
that eight groups of commodities rose, 
these being live stock, hides and 


oils, naval stores and miscellaneous 
products. Five groups, these includ- 
ing breadstuffs, provisions and gro- 
ceries, fruits, building materials and 
chemicals and drugs, declined. On 
the rising side, textiles and hides and 
leather were notable; on the declining 
side, provisions and fruits were promi-

Future Alliance | 
Sig, tage vk 
Before Premiers 


Asso- 


Cannes, January 8.—(By the 
ciated Press.) —Fremier Briand and 
Lloyd George today had their tirst talk 
on the fuutre rela.ions between 


France 
and Great Britain since they have 


been at Cannes. It is understood tha 
„ — 


questions, deing necessary to 
tle the order and form the basis of a 


closer entente pact or alliance. 

A Franeo-British ahiance for mutu- 
al defense has created a strong under- 
current of ‘opinion here, notwithstand- 
ing that the atmosphere has seemed 
to be little favorable to negotiations 
tending to make the relations between 
the two countries closer. M. Briand 
and Mr. Lloyd George appear far 
apart regarding the attitude the allies 
ought to take toward Germany after 
the default in the payment of repara- 
tions, and are not at all in accord as 
to whether the explanations onght to be 
heard at Cannes. 

Council circles were much agitated 
today by reports from Paris that a 


{ treaty had been signed, but the only 
document known to exist touching}. 


upon the question of an alliance is a 
memorandum which sets forth reasons 
as a basis for such a pact. M. Briand’s 
flat declaration fer an alliance before 


| he departed from Paris made a marked 


impression on the British, who ad- 
vanced the argument that it would be 
easier to deal with France on Euro- 
pean questions if she were not able to 
hold forth as an argument on her part 
failure to secure from the United 
States guarantees for her security, 
such as would have been given her if 
the Versailles tripartitate agreement 
had been ratified. 
To Clear Decks. 

The decision to discuss the situation 
in Asia-Minor here, instead of at 
Paris, at a later date, is interpreted 
as a move to do away with all subjects 
in controversy between the two cour 
tries, so as to clear the way for a 
convention covering all European and 
eastern questions. 

The reparation experts have in- 
creased the total amount which Ger 
many will be required to pay fh cash in 
1922 from $500,000,000 gold marks to 
700,000,000. This was done as a 
concession to Belgium, when it was 
seen that 500,000, would be entlre- 
ly absorbed in te cost of the armies of 
occupation. 

Belgium has made à determined 
fight for the priority which is due her, 
and the increase in the year’s pay- 

ents makes posible tne continuance 
of this priority. 

Wait United States Reply. 

The allies are anxiously awaiting 
a reply from the United States to the 
invitation to join in the economic 
conference; both M. Briand and Mr. 
Lloyd George are confident of its ac- 
ceptance. The American ambasador. 
Mr. Harvey, has not yet received any 
word, but it is believed a reply may 
come tomorrow or Tuesday. 

There is considerable speuclation in 
allied circles as to how the United 
States will regard the new attitude 


toward Russia, but both the French 


and British delegates are of the opin- 
ing that the United States will recog- 
nize Russia on the conditions they 
have laid down. The British feel cer- 
tain that the soviet leaders will accept 


the condltions after they have tried 


to bargain for better terms. No reply 
is 
present. ;
