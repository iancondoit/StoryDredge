Ashburn, Ga., January 11.—(Spe-| Message Taken as Rebuke 
cial.)—At the first session of the 


Swine Growers’ association held here 
today it was. announced that every 
bank in Turner county had agreed 
to lend money to their customers to 
be used in buying hogs at the pure- 
bred sale here tomorrow. Features of 
the day were speeches by Dr. An- 
drew M. Soule, president of the State 
College of Agriculture, and Roland C. 
Turner, of the development depart- 
ment of the Southern railway, and 
the fat hog sale this afternoon, at 
which five carloads of hogs were sold. 

From the opening session until the 
last of the hogs were loaded on the 
ears, Ashburn was crowded with vis- 
itors brought here by the hog show 
and sale. At no time was more in- 
terest manifested than when Dr. An- 
drew M. Soule was speaking. Stand- 
ing room was at a premium in the 
courtroor:, while he talked to the 
farmers of Turner. 

No Overproduction. 

“There has been no overproduction,” 
said Dr. Soule, in speaking today, “but 
the trouble is we have not been ship- 
ping to the right markets and the 
products have noty been put in stand- 
ard marketable Shape. 

“Not enough surplus products are 
now being raised to supply the needs 
of Georgia alone.” 

Plans are under way to increase the 
swine production in connection with 
the creamery recently established here.

The coroner’s jury investigating 
the death of J. Russell Compton, sec - 
retary-treasurer of the Nunnally-Mc- 
Rea company, in returning its verdict 
did not in any way intend to convey 
the idea that the death of Mr. Comp- | 
ton came as the result of self-inflicted 
wounds, Lewis Parker, of the Dough- 
erty-Little-Redwine company, member 
of the jury, announced Wednesday. 
Mr. Parker said the members.of the 
jury desired to correct any impression 
that may exist that the jury intended 
to render a verdict that left a possi- 
bility that Mr. Compton committed 
suitide. 

“The suicide theory was eliminated 
by the jury,“ Mr. Parker said. “It 
was the sentiment of the jury that 
Mr. Compton came to his death from 
wounds inflicted by some person un- 
known to the jury. We do not want 
Sur verdict to be misunderstood in 
this connection, and feel that the 
statement should be made that we 
eliminated the suicide theory early 
in our discussion. 

Mr. Parker said that only one mem- 
ber of the jury suggested the theory 
of suicide. 

„Rev. C. ©. Carey, foreman of the 
jury, suggested the possibility of sui- 
cide. When he learned that the vote 
on such a theory would be five to one 
against suicide he readily agreed to 
eliminate this theory,” Mr. Parker 
said.

Washington, January 11.—Testi- 
| mony contradicting that of former 
service men was given today by army 
officers. before a senate committee in- 
vestigating charges that American 
diers had been hanged without tr 

in France. Colonel Charles J. Sy- 
monds, of Camp Sherman, 36 years in 
the army, who was in command at 
Gievres, at Which place soldiers had 
told of hearing reports of numerous 
executions, declared only one man was 
hanged there and that the hanging, by 
his orders, was secret. 

The fact of the execution was made 
public later, the colonel explaining that 
the. murder for which the soldier was 
put to death had not been committed in 
his area, and he did not want a big 
crowd on hand to witness it. The pic- 
ture of a gallows, supposed to be at 
Gievres, which had been filed with 
the committee by a former soldier was 
identified by Colonel Symonds as the 
structure built there or one closely 
resembling it.“

Paris, January 11.—Premier Bri- 
and may surrender his leadership oe 
e French government at a cabinet 
eeting to be held Thursday morning, 
at which President Millerand will pre- 
side. 2 
The outstanding fact arising from 
comment in parliamentary circles is 
that Briand has apparently complete- 
ly lost the confidence of his colleagues 
in the cabinet, and that his resigna- 
tion must naturally follow—without 
waiting for defeat by the chamber and 
senate. 

The ministry is reported to be ab- 
solutely opposed to any Franco-Brit- 
ish alliance under which France wou 
surrender a single franc in reparations 
claims in return for what is described 
as “problematical assistance” in the 
event of aggression from Germany.

which he repeats that the reconstruc- 
tion of Europe must have precedence 
over that of France, and that the 
allies must wait “two or three years” 
before arriving at u Ainancial settie- 
ment with Germany, merely adde fuel .

Sign Manifesto. 
The foreign affairs committee, in- 


With two members opposing, the 
finance committee of city council voted 
an appropriation of $42,000 Wednes- 
day afternoon to buy the remaining 
half of the lot on Edgewood avenue 
proposed as a public market site. Half 
of the tract, which embraces a bigck, 
was purchased January 2, and an op- 
tion on the other half secured. Alder- 
man I. N. Ragsdale and Councilman 

W. Pat Anderson constituted the mi- 
nority voting no. 

The lot is bounded by Edgewood 
avenue, Bell, Butler and Boaz streets. 
Mayor Key and a large delegation 
of members of the Atlanta Woman’s 
club, including Mrs. B. M. Boykin, 
president, and Mrs. Norman Sharp, 
chairman of the market committee, 
were present to request the appro- 
priation. 

While no active fight to obstruct the 
measure was made at the Wednesday 
session, it has been generally an- 
nounced in advance by the market an- 
tagonists that they will attack the 
finance sheet when it is presented to 
council with the market item included. 

Argument of Opponents. 

It is understood that members op- 
posing the project will contend that 
the half of the lot already bought and 
paid for is big enough on which to 
erect a market building, and that from 
its operation Atlanta can see whether 
the plan is a success or not. ‘hey 
will assert that it will be a ruthless 

Maste of the taxpayers’ money to spend 
another $42,500 until a market has 
been tried out on the tract recently 
purchased. They Will argue that it 

5 win be an easy enough matter to en- 
large the building to cover the whole 
block in the event of success of the 
venture. 

The appropriation Adbertesl Wed 
nesday was only $22,000, since the 
$500 option was included as a part 
of the purchase price. 

Mayor Key spoke at some length in 
asking for the balance. Mrs. Boykin 
addressed the committee in only a few 
words, “We know you're going to 
give us this money,” she said, because 
you've already been sold on the mar- 

. ket.” She expressed the thanks of the 
club for the committee's aid and prom- 
ised that the women stood ready to 
help Atlanta promote any public move- 
ment for the welfare of the city. 

Position of Mayor. 

The mayor declared that “if the 
market hurts some people it will be 
because they have hurt the public.” 
He stated also that “every merchant 
around here who has been kicking 
about this market will have a stall 
down there when it is completed, and 
1 am in favor of it, too.” 

Next to the market A4gnd, the largest 
uppropriation inserted in the sheet 
at the afternoon session was $20,000 
for the extension of Highland avenue 
to Harris street. Councilman Claude 
Ashley appeared in behalf of this im- 
provement. 

The city warden’s office was given 
more money for its operation and 
maintenance. The salary of Mies Hliz- 
abeth Ivey, assistant warden, was in- 
creased $15 a month and the clerk in 
the department $5.

Cooper or Kuippa, of New Castle, 
Penn., “McDonald said he was ready 
to testify in support of recent testi- 
mony to that effect, by Edward Duner 
of San Francisco. 

Details of the execution of a sol- 
dier at Gievres on June 20, 1919, was 
given by Colonel Symonds, of 
Camp Sherman, Ohio, who was in 
command there at the time. The gal- 
lows, he said, was erected the night 
of June 19, the execution was secret 
and was not known generally until the 
next day. 

“T saw no reason for making it pub- 
lie because the crime was not com- 
mitted at Gievres,” he added. “I di- 
rected that nobody should attend but 
a certain number of witnesses.” 

„Was there any other gallows at 
Gievres?“ Chairman Brandegee asked. 

“Not while I was there—from Feb- 
ruary, 1918, to July, 1919. 

Some witnesses heretofore had testi- 
fied that guards had told them of the 
hanging of upwards of a dozen soldiers 
at Gievres. i

Colonel Symonds was shown a pic- 
ture of a gallows at Gievres as sub- 
mitted_by a former service man.

at Gievres. I believe it is the one I 
ordered erected there“ he said. , 

Senator Watson, democrat, of ‘Geor- 
gia, whose charges of illegal exeécu-. 
d to the investigation sharply 
cross-éxamined Colonel Symonds con- 
cerning the “secrecy surrounding the 
execution at Gievres.“ 

“Was the soldier hanged in a uni- 
form?” Senator Watson asked. 

“Yes. The body. was taken down

“Did the soldier make any statement 


| prior to the hanging?” 


“On the gallows he asked that his 
family be notified, but that they be 
not told how he died. He also asked 
that they shoot and not hang him,” 
Colonel Symonds said. 

Only One Execution. 


J. P. Fyffe, a manufacturer, of 
Chattanooga, Tenn., who was ex- 
ecutive officer to Colonel Symonds at 
Gievres from August, 1918, to August, 
1919, testified there was only one exe- 
cution there in that period. 

While efforts were being made to 
keep the hanging at daylight secret, 
Mr. Fyffe said, “the news got around 
by noon. : 

„I never heard of a lynching and I 
ceftainly would have heard of it had 
it occurred,” he added. 

Captain Joseph D. Hahn, now at 
Camp Benning, Ga., wlio was station- 
ed at Gievres from March, 1918, to 
July 20, 1919, said he heard of no 
illegal executions at that point. Dur- 
ing his service there he only knew of 
the one legal hanging. 

“A witness, Harry W. Segal, of 
Dorchester, Mass., has testified that 
he saw you and others take two negro 
soldiers out and execute them,” Cap- 
tain Hahn was informed. “Is that 
true?’ he was asked. 

“It’s absolutely untrue,” said Cap- 
tain Hahn, adding that he could not 
recall Segal or any incident which 
might have caused him to make such a 
statement. 

Discounts Story. 

The provost officer at Gievres, Os- 
car P. Cole, of Berlin, N. H., 
who was stationed there from 
April, 1918, to June, 1919, testified 
he never heard of the alleged lynching 
of the negro there.

The Japanese are also displeased 
because of the American and British 
insistence that the Shantung question 
must be settled, and settled here in 
Washington before the conference ad-

For the last ten days personal repre- 
sentatives of Hughes and Balfour have

Japanese to meet the Chinese and set-

is the crux and center of the whole 
Shantung dispute. 

The unvarnished truth is, the Japa-

ferees—and that is a broad statement 
—in yieldi::: to their superior diplo-

Underwood Sounds Warning. 

Senator Underwood, of Alabama, 


lican colleagues that the democrats 
will.carry the issue before the people 
if Newberry is seated. The repub- 
lican party, he insisted, is responsi- 
ble and is on trial. 

“It is not a question of the seat it- 
self or of the personality of the can- 
didate,” said Underwood. “As 1 see 
the case, the issue involved is whether 
the republican party, as a party, in- 
tends to obey the law of the land. 
Seldom has there been a contest case 
so closely connected with party or- 
ganization.” 

Newberry, Underwood declared, was 
drafted by the republican organization, 
and when the republicans saw they 
could not win, they determined to buy 
his seat.” The amount spent, he said, 
could not have been used legitimately.

Underwood. “Somebody was guilty,

Plans for launching the drive for 
the Atlanta quota of the $1,000,000 
Woodrow Wilson foundation fund were 
practically completed Wednesday aft- 
ernoon, when members ef the local 
committee, Jesse E. Mercer, chairman, 
met in the offices of Marvin Under- 
wood, a member of the national com- 
mittee; in the Candler building. Final 
touches to the local campaign are ex- 
pected to be put on Friday afternoon 
when the committee meets again. 

Burgess Smith was asked to draft a 
formal address to the people of Geor- 
gia, explaining the foundation move- 
ment and appealing for popular sub- 
scriptions. The campaign will begin 
next Monday, when the hour from 
noon to 1 o’clock will be observed 
as the “Woodrow Wilson hour.” Dur- 
ing that hour, local organizations will 
be addressed by promivent men on the 
character and ideals of Wilson. 

The address which will be drafted by 
Mr. Smith wil be signed by thirty or 
forty leading admirers of Woodrow 
Wilson, and will be published in the 
Sunday newspapers. It will be ex- 
pressly noted in the address that 
everybody in Georgia is in a position 
to be placed on the honor roll of the 


scription will be as welcome as larger 
onations.

zured himself in the trial of two 4 
against moonshiners here last year. 
Stewart has issued no public state- 
ment, but has employed attorneys to 
represent him at the hearing before 
the commissioners. Attorney for the 
citizens who brought the petition urg- 
ing the removal of Stewart, declared 
that the case will be carried before 
Judge Thomas, of the southern circuit,

Simultanęously, it was stated that 
a large number of witnesses- had been

of the charges brought against the 
officer at the hearing before the com-

submitted to the chamber of com- 
merce at its meeting Thursday after- 
noon. oo 

It is known that the chamber of 
commerce favors turning the Gaines- 
ville railway, which faces being junk- 
ed, into an electric line, and members 
of that organization had considered 


a plan whereby the company would be 


turned over to the Central of Georgia 
company. It was learned, however, 
from an authoritative source tonight 
that the commerce body is favorably 


‘inclined. toward the plan of placing 


the ‘company in the hands of. the 
Georgia Railway and Power company. 
It is believed the plan will be passed. 
Territory Covered. 
‘Tf the plan conceived by the 
merchants materializes, the elec- 
tric line will extend to Tallulah 
Falls. The Georgia Railway and 
Power company has power lines along 
the route, and it is thought that it 
would not be difficult for the trolley 
interurban line to be completed. 
The Tallulah railway, which is at 
present operated by the Southern, can 
be had for a negligible sum, it is said. 
and the Athens citizens favor the 
Georgia Railway and Power company 
taking over this route, thus completing 
the circuit to Tallulah.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Dublin, January 11.—The summon- 
ing of the southern parliament to 
meet Saturday by Arthur Griffith, 
president of the dail eireann, and his 
cabinet has started the machinery for 
putting the treaty into operation. Half 
a dozen huge vans backed in front of 


lin castle this afternoon and removed 
stacks of official documents and ef- 


partments, thus beginning the evacua- 
tion of the castle—the symbol to Irish- 
men for centuries of British control. 

Eamon De Valera infermed the 


correspondents that he believed his 
party would ignore the Saturday meet- 
ing of the parliament. In response 
to an inquiry regarding his plans, he 
said he intended to continue the fight 
for independence; he supposed elec- 
tions would be held within six or nine 
months. * 
An important development today 
was the isstance of a manifesto by . 
the Irish labor party stating that la- 
bor would participate in the elections 
to secure representation in the new 
Free State government. The method 
adopted in summoning those who are 
to ratify the treaty is held to indi- 
cate that the British desire to avoid 
friction in the transference of the au- 
thority of Ireland. Instead of acfing 


directly, the British government acted 
through the dail cabinet, leaving the

the plan of admitting spectators and 
press representatives to the courtroom 
by a card was again employed.

OUTSIDE EVIDENCE 
IN PAR CLEARANCE 
HEARING IS BARRED 


By a ruling of Judge Beverly D. 

Evans in the hearing of the par 
clearance controversy it was held that 
testimony pertaining to action of Fed- 
eral Reserve banks outside of the 
sixth district, was irrelevant, at the 
Wednesday session of the United 
States district court. No indication 
as to when a decision would be reach- 
ed was seen. 
John W. Davis, former ambassador 
to Great Britain, and internationally 
known lawyer, represented the Fed- 
eral Reserve bank of Atlanta in the 
argument Wednesday. 

The question’ before th: court was 
as to whether testimony from out- 
side. of the sixth district would be 
admissible. At the, time the argu- 
ment as to the admissibility of testi- | 
mony was brought up, Long, | 
an Oregon banker, was on the stand. 
The decision of the court was reserved 
pending further hearing. 


Constructive Effort 
In Commercial Lines 
Predicted by Candler | 


With the two years’ period of defla. 
tion completed, the present year will | 
be a period for constructive effort in | 
commercial lines, according to the 
opinion of Asa G. Candler, president 
of the Central Bank and Trust cor- 
poration. % : 

That business and agriculture will 
now be built on a more practical basis, 
is the belief of Mr. Candler. He states | 
that the reverses of the past year Nave 
eleared the public mind of ideas of 
wild extravagance which were devel- | 
oped by the war.

on the floor of the senate and when 
the contest was being heard by a 
senate committee; for his “de- 
fense” was so lame as to be pa- 
thetic! 

Newberry did not deny that his 


‘friends and supporters conducted 


in his behalf a boodle campaign in 
Michigan; that, as charged, not 
less than $200,000 was expended 
in that campaign; or that he was 
tried and convicted and sentenced 
to the penitentiary for violation of 
the corrupt practice law, the ver- 


dict and sentence subsequently be- 


ing set aside by the supreme court 


on a technicality. 


He said that he personally con- 
tributed only $1,500 to the repub- 
that he 


put out money to elect him he did 
not know it, by whom it was con- 
tributed or to what particular 
purpose it was applied. 

If Newberry can retain a seat 
in the senate after such a miser- 


able showing as he and his friends 


have made, all pretense at safe- 
guarding the ballot-box may as 


well be discarded.

ANOTHER CREAMERY. 


A new creamery has just been | 


put in operation in Dublin, Ga. 
The plant began taking cream, 
from the 


start at once. 
The opening of this creamery, 


Says the news dispatch— 


means a market for cream not only 


ifrom Laurens county, but for some 


‘fifteen or twenty counties around 
‘Dublin, which has nost excellent 


“train schedules for shipping milk 


and cream to the creamery.’ 
There is no greater community 


developer than is an enterprise of 


_this kind; and the most gratifying 
thing about the announcement 


“from Dublin is that this creamery 


is only one of several similar 
institutions that have been put 
into operation in Georgia within 
a year. 

That no state surpasses Georgia 
in point of natural adaptability to 


the dairy industry has been fully 


demonstrated; and that the in- 
dustry is in no danger of over- 
‘crowding is proven by the never- 


failing demand for dairy products 


throughout the country, also by 
the tremendous amoünt of the out- 


put of northern, eastern and west- 


‘ern creameries that is annually 
imported for consumption in 
Georgia. - 
One dairy firm alone, in Mis- 
Suri, ships into Georgia every 
year an average of $700,000 worth 
of its products: 
only should we be producing 
our own cream, butter and

Bankers and business men 
should be glad of an opportunity 
to finance and provide such facili- 
ties for the handling of farm prod- 
ucts for they mean more money 
for the farmers, and that means 
more money for the banks, and 
that means more money for the 
merchants. Such co-operation 
makes for community prosperity 
all 'round. 

What has been done in Dublin, 
in Columbus, in Rome, in Ash- 


should be emulated by other com- 
munities, and the result would be 
better farming, richer land, more 


districts, and more self-respecting, 
better contented farmers. 


This done, it would not be long 
until the people of every county 
in Georgia would feel like follow- 
ing the example of the community 
of southwestern Alabama which 
recently erected a monument ex- 
pressive of its gratitude to the 
boll weevil!

TWO UNTIMELY DEATHS. 

The untimely deaths of Mrs. 
Clem R. Harris and Remsen P. 
King, both occtirring during the 
current week, are received with 
universal sorrow in Atlanta. 

Mrs. Harris was the embodi- 
ment of benevolence, love, and 
womanly tenderness. There was 
never a woman in Atlanta whose 
every day activities were more 
characteristic of the Christian 
spirit than were those of this no- 
ble woman who in the prime of 
life was suddenly taken from the 
community in which she has wield- 
ed such a helpful and uplifting in- 
fluence. 

But as sad as was the death of 
Mrs. Harris, that of Remsen King, 
occurring under peculiarly tragic 
circumstances, was even sadder in 


that it struck a fine young man 
just as he was entering upon the. 
threshold of a business career, 
after returning from splendid 
service to his country in the 
World War. 

Mr. King was the son of the 
late Porter King, former mayor of 
Atlanta and for many years one 
of its most highly esteemed citi- 
zens. His mother has for many 
years taken a leading part in the 


the heart of the entire community 
will go out to her in the affliction: 
which she is called upon to bear, 

Just why these things happen, 
God only knows. But since the be- 
ginning of time, strong men and 
strong women have been stricken 


so it will be until the end of time. 
While the philosophy of such 
fate does not lessen:the sorrow of 
friends, nor assuage the grief of

-WIDENING EDGEWOOD. 

The proposal to widen Edge-, 
wood avenue 80 feet is receiving 
hearty support on the part both of 


ald brooch, and displaying 3 


ja hace Satie Mow Teer. Oot. om 


the property owners and of the 
city. 

The city can do nothing that 
tends more to hasten its develop- 
ment and to enhance property 
values along its main thorough- 
fares than to widen them when- 
ever it is practicable to do.so. 

The widening of any street that 
is too narrow to adequately ac- 
commodate the traffic that it 
bears or that may be attracied 
to it is beneficial both to the city 
and to the owners of property 
abutting upon the street so im- 
proved. 

As the city develops it becomes 
impossible, or certainly more and 
more difficult, to increase the 
width of streets. 

In every instance widened 
streets have added tremendously 
to the value of all abutting prop- 
erty as well as to the general use- 
fulness of the street. 

Edgewood is a main arterial 
thoroughfare, and it is destined to 
become more and more so with 
time, 

It is inconceivable that any own- 
er of property facing it will hesi- 
tate to give the proposal to widen 
the street both approval and en- 
couragement. 

Any property owner who objects 
to this improvement retards the 
enhancement of his own property.

MENTAL WASTE. 


1 can understand many phases of, 
extravagance in the one who, after 
many years of labor, has accumulated 
and saved. There is a certain thrill in 
spending money for beautiful things. 

But waste—deliberate waste—is a 
thing I have never been able to un; 


able proportion of intelligence. 

And of all wastes, what can com- 
pare in tragedy to mental waste? 

I have in mind one who was oncé 
a very close friend of mine. I have 
rarely known such brilliance of mind. 
But so wasteful did his mental proe- 
esses become that his will seemed to

The longer we live, the more we | 
come to realize the richness of con- 
served thought, observation and study. | 
That which we haye saved comes back 
to inspire us on to better ways and 
meaus. 

The boy who habitually buries him | 
self in books and h y exercise and 
a reasonable profiaction % of work dur-

little concern from those who have 
fathered and mothered him—no matter

uric acid er any other acid. The dis- 
colorization is due to a chemical re- 
action of the base metal, silver or 
copper, of the alloy with sulphur in 
the sweat or sebum of the skin. 
Sulphur compounds are normally pres- 
ent in the excretions of the skin. So 


little more alive than some others who 
do not notice stains from jewelry. 
Use a drop of aromatic spirits of 
ammonia on handkerchiep or elotb to 
remove the stain from the skin.

Kindly define the terms “high blood 
pressure” and “low blood pressure.” 
A friends asserts that a person who 
is “full blooded” and florid in com- 
plexion has . blood pressure. Is 
that true? (V. J. E.) 

Answer—No. Most individuals who 
have high blood pressure are rather 
pallid, and many who are popularly 
considered full blooded and who have 
a florid complexion have low blood 
pressure and perhaps even insuffi- 
cient blood or weak blood : (anemia). 
Appearances are misleadings Blood 
pressure is the tension of the blood 
in the arteries, maintained normally 
by the pumping of the blood by the 
heart and by the musculay and elastſe 
pressure upon the blood. by the ar- 
teries themselves and by the body 
muscles around the arteries. Blood 
pressure in the services pipes of a 
municipal water system, save thar 
these pipes are inelastic. When the 
blood pressure increases to an abnor- 
mal degree from any cause, the indi- 
vidual has “high blood pressure,“ 
which may not be, and usually is not. 
of much importance, that is. in itself. 
It is silly to imagine that “high blood 
pressure“ is the name of any disease 
condition, or that any remedy or 
treatment purporting to reduce high 
blood pressure will cure the patient. 
It would be as sensible to imagine 
that a swelling of the eye or the knee

Dr. Wang is a Christian and was 
educated at an American mission col- 
lege in Shanghai. He speaks English 
with a fluency that is remarkable and 
he knows international litics just 
like he knows the laws of his land as 
interpreted by his own court. 

~ = ww 


It was my pleasure to talk for half 
an hour with this distinguished mem- 
ber of the Chinese delegation, and he 


told me more about China, her cus- 
toms, the gradual evolution of the 
ideals of Christian statesmanshi 

aspirations of the ancient but newly 
reborn government of China, the 
steady march of western progress in 


and the longing for that happiness 
of national contentment and 
prosperity—more about inviting, allur- 
ing, almost altruistic China, than 
had ever heard of or read of before in 
all my life. 


Listen to his own words 
“The world has in its history de- 
veloped two great civilizations, one 


in the west and one in the east. The 
western civilization is composed of 
the early Greek and Koman culture, 
enriched by the contributions of Teu- 
tonic vigor and Christianity. 


“This branch of civilization has 
been carried to all parts: of Europe, 
then it crossed the Atlantic ocean and 


found a new home in the United 
States of America. About à hundred 
years ago it began to cross the Pa- 
cific ocean and now it is penetrating 
the continent of Asia. But China rep- 
resents the home of the eastern civili- 
zation which is one of long develop- 
ment, slow growth and natural evclu- 
tion. The dominant note of that 
civilization is peace.. It lacks the 
knowledge of science and all the im- 
provements developed through the dis- 
covery of the power of steam and elec- 
tricity. Two thousand and five hun- 
dred years ago our great philosopher 
taught that ‘all men within the four 
seas are brothers’ and enjoined our 
forefathers, ‘Do not do unto others 
that, ye would no have others do unto 
you.’ 


The light that China had, she gave 
freely to her surrounding. nations 


such as Japan, Korea, Siam and oth- 
ers. China's history has been writ- 
ten for the past four thousand years 
in accordance with the standard of 
justice. China is historically the 
champion of peace and of international 
good understanding. | 

“On the other side of the Pacific 
ocean from China stands the United 
States of America as the youngest son 
| of western civilization. It has Leen 
t-called the New World; it has been the 


On account of its rich

ment; sympathizing with the great 
sufferings of all mankind groaning un- 
der staggering taxation; a voice has 
been raised as from the wilderness to

all mankind. It may be known -as 
‘American Idealism’ or ‘Altruism,’ but

but even neutral nations enduring

morally, so long there will be wars 
and — suffering. ; 

“At one time in the course of hu- 
man history, a man from the next 
town, tribe, state or nation was al- 
ways an object, of derision. He might 
be laughed at, ' despised, ill-treated or 
murdered without much compunction 
on the part of*the natives. But thanks 
to the modern form of communica- 
tions, there is now a closer bond of fel - 
lowship between. the inhabitants of 
the earth. .The dictates of conscience 
and the teachings of the brotherhood 
of mankind have gradually led to bet- 
ter mutual understanding and good- 
will. It appears to me; therefore, that 
by promoting a closer bond .of inter- 
national fellowship, many causes. for 
friction and misunderstanding can be 
removed 

“Raising the standard of interna- 
tional morality and promoting a closer 
bond of international fellowship— 
these I consider the cornerstones of 
lasting world peace.” 

At this point in his conversation 
Dr. Wang reached for the Bible that 


topped a pile of books on his desk, 
and began to talk of the teachingy of 
Christ, the efficacy of prayer and the 
peace that comes to a nation as to an 
individual when a contact is estab- 
lished with God 

And then— 

“On one July the Fourth, Phillips 
Brooks was asked to give a sermon 
| at the Westminster Abbey. of London. 
He spoke in terms of a world citizen 
and a Christian prophet and he asked 
the English congregation to pray with 
him that the blessings from om high 
might rest upon the strange meeting 
of the races in America, of. which a 
new race is being born and upon all 
that the life of the United States 
may mean to mankind, For God means 
to build up in that land some char- 
acteristic manhood which shall help 
to complete the civilization of the 
world. | 

“As individual relationship one na- 
tion should treat another as brothers. 
Only in this way can national prej- 
udice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness 
which are the principal causes of war 
be eradicted. 
of international fellowship is instilled 
into the mind and sowed in the breast 
of every living soul, then injustice 
aud selfishness which have so often 
been made the basis of national policy 
and conduct will give way to justice 
and altruism; then the ‘dreadnaught’ 
and the mmiled fist’ will yield to rea- 
son and righteousness and Tennyson's 
dream of ‘the parliament of men, the 
federation of the world,’ which was 
merely a poetic fancy, will be an ac- 
complished fact. 

“‘Unfversal peace aid brotherhood 


of men’ which Confucious taught the 
people of the east and Christ taught 
the people of the west, centuries ago, 
will be something more than religious 
gospel. The time will come when 
the impassioned lips of the world’s 
patents will take up Symond’s noble

In every heart and brain shall throb

General slowing down of industry! 
after the spurt in October was the 
outstanding characteristic of the No- 
vember figures as shown in the mont h- 
ly “Survey of Current Business,” just 
published by the department of com- 
merce, This is partially accounted 
for, according to the “Survey,” by a 
seasonal reaction in certain lines, such 
as textiles and automobiles, and in 
other lines, such as coal and transpor- 
tation, by the overestimation of Oc- 
tober business in the the face of the 
threatened railroad strike. 

The general result of November con- 
ditions appeared to be stabilization. 
This tendency was felt especially in 
textiles, metals, building construction 
and its related industries, and — 
sales. It was also manifested in pri 
movements, employment conditieus 
and in railroad transportation. 

Figures on November production in- 
dicate increased activity over October 
in metals, clothing, paper and glass. 
On the other hand, production for No- 
vember slackened among the food- 
stuffs, tobacco and fuels, — an 
irregular condition existed ‘in the con- 
struction industries, 

All commodities in the building ma- 
terial, clothing, tobacco and foodstuff 
groups were being produced in greater 
volume than the 1913 average, except 
— products, which were only 1 per 

t below. e metals were all con- 
siderably below the pre-war basis in 
spite of good increases during No- 
vember, while the fuels were divided, 
with petroleum and by-product coke 
far: above the pre-war average, the 
coals slightly below and beehive coke 
far Copper and beehive coke 
were — at less than 20 per 
cent of their pre-war rate. | 

Stocks of commodities at the end 
of November were, in general, slight- 
ly larger than in 1919. The largest 
relative stocks were those of corn and 
coal, both more than five times as 
large, due partly to seasonal varia- 
— Increases of from 50 to 100 per 

t occurred 


in wheat and —— 
— oil, both la seasonal in- 
creases, and in zine. 
— and petroleum. Outsi 
decrease in meats all the de- 


and clothing prices and retail fodd also 
tended towards a lower level. The most 
important advances were in silk and 

petroleum. Iron, steel and coal rémain- 
ed practically unchanged, while other 
metals, except lead, advanced. 

The cotton crop. turned out to be 
considerably larger than earlier esti- 
mates, but 36 per cent less than the 
pre-war average. Imports of raw cot- 
ton during November were the -heav- 
iest since March, 1920, but exports 
slumped over 25 per cent from the 
high mark made in October, There 
was a Slight increase in the number 
of active spindles and, an increase of 
about 61 per cent in the consumption 
of cotton, to the highest monthly fig- 
ure since June, 1920. 

Late reports received by the de- 
partment of commerce indicate that 
the textile business during December 
slackened since November. This is 
only partly due to “between season 
dullness. General world economic von- 
ditions and the lack of purchasing 
power among the farmers of the mid- 
die west are stated to be the chief 
causes. So

larger than in November, 1920.

Following a dinner in the Kimball 
house banquet hall this evening at 6:30 


e Presbyterian 
churches in the city*and prominent 
ns are expected to attend 

Kev. I. S. McElroy, of 
Columbus, chairman of the executive 
committee on education, of synod of 
Georgia, is expected to speak. Other 
speakers will include John A. Sib- 
Jey and Dr. J. S. Lyons, of Atlanta. 

Each speaker will emphasize the im- 
portance of every Presbyterian re- 
sponding liberally to the appeal of the 
church for $200,000 to be used for 
the support and expansion of the 
North Avenue Presbyterian scheol in 
Atlanta and the Nacoochee institut. in 
Sautee. Especial emphasis will be 
placed on the value of the North Ave- 
nue school to every Presbyterian in 
Atlanta, and upon the ever-increasing 
need of Christian edueation and the 
high standard. of morality it instils 
into the youth of the nation in this 
age of materialism and commercialism. 

Another point that will be stressed 
by each speaker will be the fact that 
the Presbyterian church will soon be 
far behind other churches in the mat- 
ter of Christian education unless all 
members of the denomination heed the 
synod’s call for support and grasp this 
opportunity to redeem the failures of 
the past in supporting schools of the 
church. 

After the speeches are concluded a 
complete program for the campaign 
will be* made for this city. Teams in 
each church will be organized. Every- 
thing will be made ready for the in- 
tensive campaign of the coming week.

In Senate Fight 


Hiram Fails to Rally to Aid 
of Colleagues in New- 
berry Storm. 


BT JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Bureau, 
Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, January 11—(By 
Constitution Leased Wire.)—Perhaps 
no incident in recent years in the 
senate has created so much comment 
as the failure of Senator Johnson, of 
California—“Hell Roarin’ Hiram” as 
he loves te be ealled—to appear on 
the scene to aid his progressive col- 
leagues in their fight on Senator New- 
berry of Michigan. 

He was counted as one of those cer- 
tain to vote for the expulsion of the 
“$200,000 senator,” and 80 certain 
was Senator Borah that he would 
show up in due season that his tabu- 
lations always showed Johnson as 
poled against the accused. 

Johnson has been easily the “bell 
weather” of the progressives. 

To aspire to the leadership in the 
United States, to reach that goal and 
then to retain the honor, is an ac- 
complishment rare to the new ar- 
rivals. But with Johnson the con- 
ditions were different from those un- 
der which others labored. 

He had been the candidate for the 
vice presidency on the bull moose 
ticket in 1912. He was known 
throughout the country. In the presi- 
dential fight of 1916 he was given 
credit for the election of Woodrow 


trol in California, and because he 
frowned on the candidacy of Charles 
E. Hughes. 

Lead Fight.on Treaty. 
He came into the senate and assum- 
ed a leadership ea the fight on the 
Versailles treaty. en he became a 
candidate for the presidency in the 
last presidential primaries and again 
toured the country; acquainting the 
voters with the “Hell-Roarin’ Hiram.” 
Johnson was in the ranks of the lead- 
ers then, a man feared somewhat by 
the regular republicans in the senate. 
John Carson, in today’s Baltimore 
Evening Sun, attempts to solve the 
problem. He says: 
“What has happened to Johnson is 
perhaps a mystery to those who are 
not in daily touch with the situation 
in congress, but it is no mystery to 
his former close associates. John- 
son has gradually shipped from his 
place of power until now, when the 
Newberry case and his absence present 
conditions which may cause him to 
lose prestige forever, unless he joins 
the ranks of the zregulars“ and aspires 
to leadership and reward there. 
“The waning power of Johnson goes 
back to the republican national con- 
vention. The fight Johnson had made 
in the primaries gave him considcra- 
ble recognition. Before the convention 
in Chicago the word. went out that 
he would have to be reckoned with, 
especially in the fear that he would 
make a fight on the floor of the con- 
vention. That hour of trial came 
and some of his friends went to him 
to take the fight on the convention 
floor. He was urged to revive the 
old progressive corps. But Johnson 
did not carry on; his expected fight 
failed to materialize; his disappointed 
friends turned to Washington with 
the story that “Johnson was through.” 
Johnson was last heard from in 
Washington when President Harding 
made his announcement about the 
probability of creating an association 
of nations. He called at the white 
house shortly after that announcement 
was made, and it was said he was 
seeking information so that he might 
discuss the subject while he was in 
California. He then went away, and, 
aside from one bit of publicity given 
to a statement by him. he has been 
unheard of in Washington. 
The political gossip in Washington 
is that Johnson is anxious to return 
to the senate and that he is planning 
to carry the California primaries next 
spring. Just now his chief support- 
er, a newspaper owner in California, 
is assaulting, in a half-heatred way, 
the Harding administration, the work 
of the conference on limitation of arm- 
ament, the fight for Senator Newber- 
ry and the pronosal for an association 
of nations. When this assault began, 
an echo from Johnson was expected, 
but it did not come, except in the 
announcement that Johnson held that 
the four-power treaty op the Pacific 
demanded serious study and considera- 
tion, 

Can Johnson be defeated in Cali 
fornia in the senatorial primaries? His 
friends and those best acquainted with 
conditions in the state do not believe 
that he can, regardless of the course 
he pursnes. But there are others who 
insist that the Harding administration 
has a candidate in view to whom sup- 
port would be thrown in case Johnson 
continued to be an obstruction in the 
path of the administration. The can- 
didate mentioned is well known; he 
had one political tussle with Johnson 
and lost. 

Whatever there may be to all of this, 
the fact remains Johnson left his pro- 
gressive colleagues in the lurch in the 
Newberry fight.

Wilson, because of his absolute con- 


B. 8 Barker, vice president of 
the Gainesville-Northwestern railroad, 
president of the Gainesville Chamber 


the last three years. 

He was nominated by the executive 
committe, composed of W. O. Foote. 
president, and R. K. Rambo, R. 
Alston and P. C. Norcross, vice presi- 
dents. For the position of secretary, 
approximately 100 men applied and 
the committee also had under consid- 
eration many men who were not 
applicants. 

Mr. Barker was not an applicant 
and his election came as a complete 
surprise. When informed of the elec- 
tion he said that he was honored in 
being ehosen seeretary, because At- 
lanta has the biggest future of any 
southern city.” He, his wife, and 
daughter, Margaret, will make their 
homes here and he will enter office 
on February 1. 

President Foote following the elec- 
tion said: “We have found the man 
we -were looking for. A former At- 
lanta man, who during his residence 
here was prominent for civic spirit 
and enterprise, he understands the 
local situation; a hustler, wno 
throughout a long career as a railroad 
executive has been active and influ- 
ential in industrial expansion work 
throughout the state; a worker whose 
ability is augmented by an enthusiasm 
that will mean great things for the 
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.” 

Mr. Barker, who is an Alabaman 
by birth, entered railroad service when 
a youth at Rome, Ga. In 1904 he 
came to Atlanta as commercial and 
industrial agent for the Southern 
road, and held that capacity when he 
went to Gainesville in 1913. For the

Over 22 Prospects 


Milan R. Rump, president of the 
National Electric Light association, 
and chief engineer of Cities Service 


ednes- company, in reviewing the central sta- 


tion industry of the United States for 
the past year and commenting on the 
outlook for 1922, said: 

The electric light and power in- 
dustry has come through the trying 
conditions of 1921 with a remarkable 
of progress towards readjust- 
ment. While in certain industrial 
centers demands for lower service fell 
off materially in the early part of the 
year it is noteworthy that in aimost 
every instance these losses were over- 
come before the end of the year. A 
large portion of the gains are, of 
course, attributed to the resumption of 
the industries previously served, but 
there has also been a marked gain in 
new customers. Domestic consumption 
continues to show gains and the field 
for electricity operated -household ap- 
pliances is constantly expanding. 

“The change in the investment 
markets in the later thonths of the 
year has had a most beneficial effect 
and money is obtainable at rates 
which regulated utilities can afford to 
pay for the first time in several years. 
The result is that a general program 
of expansion is now under way and I 
am confident that 1922 will break all 
previous records for development 6f 
plants and systems, 

“The fact that the electrical utilities 
have successfully come through both 
the war and the subsequent recon- 
struction periods without an important 
failure has increased the standing of 
their securities as investments im- 
measurably. The coming year will 
be marked by many new and important 
bond issues to finance improvements, 
but a very large portion of the new 
funds needed will come from the sale 
of junior securities to the customers 
of the various local companies. 

“The industry is not overbuilt for 
even present conditions, which means 
that it must expand enormously to be 
prepared for the increased business 
which the gradual though unmistaka- 
ble return. towards normal industrial 
growth will demand of it. The elec- 
trical industry is progressing and in 
my opinion 1922 will prove a banner 
year from every viewpoint, because 
the vision ef the leaders of the in- 
industry is such as to lead it both 
wisely and aggressively.” 


EXPERTS TO TELL 
AD MEN OF VALUE 
OF NEOSHO PLAN 


The Neosho plan, which benefits 
farmers, mechanics, jobbers and manu- 


facturers, will be discussed at the first 
1922 luncheon of the Advertising Club 
of Atlanta, to be held Thursday, at 
12:30 o'clock, in the breakfast room 
oi the Kimball. 

Of special interest to Atlanta—par- 
ticularly her manufacturers and job- 
bers—is the “Hub City” idea, which 
aims to stimulate business among the 
merchants of the smaller cities and 
towns n the trade area of this city. 
This phase of the Neosho club idea 
will be diseussed by A. W. McKeand, 
director of extension of the community 
advertising department, A. A. C. of W. 
Mr. McKeand will tell of its applica- 
tion in Terre Haute, Ind., and adja- 
cent towns. , 

Paul Harber, editor of The Com- 
merce Observer, will present a general 
survey of the actual results obtained 
from a Neosho sales day in Com- 


called on to tell briefly of their expe- 
riences. 

A plan 9 action suggested for the 
Atlanta club, and the manner in which 
the committee hopes to assist in fur- 
ther organization of Georgia towns, 
will be outlined by Bill Milburn, chair- 
man of the Neosho committee. :

southern heroes of the world war will

Fort McPherson, will officiate and 
will be assisted by local patriotic 
organizations. The bodies were ex-

Mr. Barker has written a formal 
letter to the city authorities ęxplain- 
ing that he dogs so not on his own 
account, but in behalf of, the thous- 
ands who are less able to bear the 
extra burder, of which he says: 
“The list, as furnished, totais $1.47, 
while I paid $2.32, as evidenced by 


the bill—an average advance of 62 
per cent. The explanation to me was 
that the contract between the city: 
council and the publishers having ex- 


alog price prevailed. 

As far as I personally am con- 
cerned, the transaction is closed, but 
there are hundreds, probably thous | 
ands, of families of the city who have 
been hit by this advance. Many of 
them cannot well-afford the few ex- 


them. ~ 


that this matter be brought before 
the city council, The adoption of text- 
books by the schools of this city means 
something to the nublishers interested. 
and they shonld be reasonable expect- 
ed to guarantee nrices thronghout the 
school year. However, it would ap- 
“ear that the Atlanta booksellers are 
the ones who are takine advantage. in 
this instance, of the lapse in contract. 
as they are selling the stock which 
they have on hand,”

URING the past year what would 
have happened to your business 
if you had suddenly been taken away? 


You probably have spent many sleep-

losses that would havé meant disaster to

i. BY ALEXANDER F. JONES, 
g United News Staff Correspondent. 

Chicago, January 11.—Pink tad- 
poles and vermillion elephants flying 
through the azure ozone are ceasing to 
bother American liquor consumers. 

The old-time “down-and-outer,” man 
and womah, is giving way to moon- 
shine filled “men about town” and gay 
flappers. N | 

But, all in all, there are only a quar- 
ter of the number of liquor victims 
that featured pre-prohibition days. 

And liquor victims are not taking to 
drugs, as predicted by opposers of the 
dry laws. | 

These, in brief, are the conclusions 
of Mrs. Grace W. Carr, superintendent 
of the Washingtonian. home, the old- 
est drink cure institution in the Unit- 
ed States, given to the United News 


Weinestay.. ee 

The Washingtonian-home has cdred 
for inebriates since 1863. Mrs. Carr 
has been superintendent for ten years. 
She has seen thousands of drunkards 
carried in and walk out. She has ad- 
ministered to hundreds of raving wom- 
en who started wit“ the frosted cock- 
tail in the gay restaurant and ended 
with a craving that only whisky could 
satisfy. She has probably adminis- 
tered to the sufferings of more men, 
seeing violent-hued circus parades fly- 
ing through their deliriums than any 
other woman in the country. 

Hew Long Will Job Last? 

Today she is wondering how long 
her job will last. The directors of the 
institute are considéring selling the 
property and closing up shop. 

“We certainly know the effect of 
prohibition here,” she said. “It has 
brought about marked changes, 

„First, we do not have anywhere 
near aß many patients, and only a frac- 
tion of the number of delirium 
tremens cases we used to have. Delir- 
ium tremens result from consumption 
of so much liquor that the brain be- 
comes paralyzed. Now moonshine 
liquor is so deadly that the drinker 
becomes violently iN. before he can 
drink enough to get the tremens. His 
stomach is paralyzed but not his brain. 

“The patient comes in violently ill, 
and often much more violent than he 
used to be. It takes from four days 
to two weeks to get him over it, but 
he is rarely suffering from tremens. 
He is poisoned. 

“The type of patient has undergone 
a marked change. We get. few ‘down- 
and-outers’ now. b 

Women Patients Flappers. 

“The women patients here are most- 
ly flappers—girls who have been out 
on a ‘party’ and been poisoned by bad 
liquor. But we rarely get the bleary- 
eyed old woman any more, who has 
drank herself to the gutter.” _ 

There were only six patients in the 
adjoining ward as she talked. Every- 
one was young—and everyone was an 
awfully sick woman. 

“We get younger men, too, although 
this is not as uniformly the case as 
with women,” Mrs. Carr continued. 

„Another thing is that I do not re- 
member a single drug patient here who 
was a heavy drinker before prohibi- | 
tion. Drug users are not heavy liquor 
drinkers, as a rule, and in the same 
way whisky drinkers do not generally 
seek to get the desired reaction by tak- 
ing drugs.“ : 

The Washingtoniat* home} used te 
care for from 800 to 1,000 patients an- 
nually. In 1921, Mrs. Carr said, it had 
but 210 patients, 39 of whom were 


women.

~~ Surface trolley lines were tied up, 
the ferries from Manhattan developed 
“symptoms of distress and were forced 
to run on “fog time,” and suburban

because of clogged switches. 
A cannon, weighing a ton, at Long 
Branch, was blown from its pedestals 
‘and rolled into the street. Waves 
at Seabright rolled into the northern 
“section of the town, which is unpro- 
tected by a seawall, doing thousands

-” Platforms at elevated stations in 
New York were also danger spots, 
_ coated with ice and exposed to the 
full force of the gale. Two men 
were blown from one station platform 
-and severely bruised. 
Movements of shipping in the low- 
er harbor slowed down as the storm 
grew wilder. Deep-sea ships approach- 
Ing quarantine were held back, and 
11 liners and cargo steamers dropped

could outside, not daring to attempt a 
passage through Ambrose channel.

the municipality for snow shoveling,

Locally, the gale centered in two

from the Woolworth building, and

American relief workers, who orig- 
inally cautiously. placed the number 
of probable deaths in the faminé area 
this winter at 2,000,000, now say that 
5,000,000 is a low estimate, and many 
say the number may reach ten mil- 
lion, or even more. This is possible 
particularly since the shortage of 
horses, oxen and camels makes it im- 
possible to reach the more remote sec- 
tions, and since it is predicted the 
typhus epidemie probably will be the 
worse that Russia has ever suffered. 

Workers Die. . 

The Americans are feeding nearly 
1,000,000 children, and the British 
and various other organizations are 
furnishing nourishment for at least 
100,000 under the most dangerous con- 
ditions, - - 

Dr. Reginald Farrar, of the epi- 
demics commission of the league of na- 
tions; Miss. Mary Patterson, of the 
English Quaker relief mission, and 
Dr. Guerther, of the German Red 
Cross, have died within the last week 
of typhus contracted in the famine 
area. Miss Nancy Bobb and William 
Kenworthy, of the English Quaker 
unit, are ill with typhus at Buzuluk, 
near Saratoff, and Anna Louise 
Strong, of Philadelphia, who is con- 
nected with the English Quaker or- 
ganization, is recovering from the 
same malady in Moscow. Colonel 
Bell, of the American relief admin- 
istration, is convalescing from the 
disease at Ufa. 2 
These cases have occurred among 
less than fifty foreign relief workers 
in the famine area who exerted ev- 
ery precaution to avoid contracting 
typhus. The disease is so prevalent 
“throughout all the Volga regions and 
in Turkestan that the soviet..govern- 
ment has stopped all passenger serv- 
icu to and from these regions. 

Living Worse Than Dead. 

‘ George Newes, of the British-save- 
the-children fund, reports he saw 250 
frozen bodies. Many of them were 
children buried in a trench at Sara- 
toff in one day. He says trainloads 
of refugee children, underfed, and 
scantily clad, are riding from the fam- 
ine area in such a pitiable condition

discovered Wednesday night on the 
person of R. L. Sissions, 20 years old, 
of 131 Jones avenue, and Leroy Law- 
son, of 444 Simpson street, while they 
were enjoying a soda drink in the 
Jackson drug store, corner of Marietta 
and Broad streets. The police say 
Sissions resembles pictures of Frank 
DuPre, suspect in the “gray over- 
coat” bandit case. 

Both are being held at police sta- 
tion on blanket charges of suspicion. 


Sissions is thought by the police to 
be wanted in numerous burglaries and 
heldups. ‘The police also say that he 
has been arrested a number of times 
in burglar cases, but that he has 
never been convicted. The prisoners 
will be held pending an investigation. 

Patrolmen Butler and Saunders 
were walking past the Jackson drug 
store about 11:15 o'clock when 
Patrolman Butler recognized Sissions 
as a man suspicioned in various bur- 
glaries and holdups. He walked up 
to Sissions, laid his hand on Sission’s 
shoulder and felt the mouth of a pistol 
which was so strapped to the man's 
body that it pointed upwards and the 
mouth rested at the shoulder. The 

istol when taken from Sissions was 
found to be a 45-caliber automatic. 
Lawson also possessed one. 

At police station, Sissions was 
searched and a pair of rubber gloves, 
which are thought to be used in pre- 
venting finger prints, were found, in 
addition to a large blue handkerchief 
with spots, which is thought by the 
Dolice also to have been used as a 
mask. 


RAL RATES COMING 
“DOWN, SAS WILLA 


Washington, January 11.—Railroad 
rates are being slowly but steadily 
forced downward by economic law» 
which govern their levels, Daniel 
Willard, president of the Baltimore 
and Ohio railroad, argued today 
before the interstate commerce com- 
mission, when that body resumed its 
inquiry into general level of trans- 
portation charges. There is no need 
but considerable danger, he added, 
in forcibly decreasing them by gov- 
ernment edict at the present time. 

Mr. Willard appeared as the first 
of several railroad presidents who 
will sum up the case of the common 
carriers in defense of the existing rate 
levels. He was preceded by several 
statisticians who presented masses of 
figures all.tending to prove insuf- 
ficient earnings from railroad opera- 
tions during recent months, and 
meager prospects, for apprectable im- 
provement even if present rates are 
maintained. 

What, then, may the public ex- 
pect?’ Mr. Willard said in reviewing 
the statistical case. “Must it con- 
tinue to pay existing rates and fares? 
Is no relief to be expected? 

To assume that such is the case 
would be in error. In the past Amer- 
ican railroads’ have afforded the 
eheapest transportation service in the 
world. They will do so again. They

This vessel for the past two years 

has done nothing but bring whisky 
from Nassau and Bimini, Bahama Is- 
lands, to the coast of Florida, Geor- 
ia and South Carolina, and is listed 
y the prohibition department at 
Washington, D. C., as one of several 
vessels of American and British reg- 
istry engaged in the whisky smug- 
gling game on the South Atlantic 
coast. 

Could Talk Interestingly. 


“If one of the members of the crew 
could be induced to talk, he could 
tell a wonderful tale. Personally I 
am not in possession of direct evi- 
dence, but I am sure that an inves- 
tigation pushed by the intelligence bu- 
reau of the internal revenue depart- 
ment or the bureau of investigation 
would reveal evidence that would 
cause the government to seize this 
vessel. * 

“The favorite plan of these smug- 
glers is to have two sets of clearance 
papers, one for Nova Scotia with a 
cargo of liquors and the other to some 
American port in ballast, the liquors 
are disposed off shore or in some re- 
mote place and the vessel puts into 
port in ballast and clears from there. 
Wish I was able to give you more 
assistance. Look for two sets of pa- 
pers on every one of these smug- 
glers.“ 

Investigation of the activities of 
the Messenger of Peace along the lines 
suggested by Mr. Bergstrom will be 
pushed by prohibition headquarters,“ 
officials declared. 

List Is Compiled. 


A list of liquor smuggling. vessels. 
operating in American waters has 
been compiled by federal authorities 
for use in combating rum runners, 
it was said at prohibition headquar- 
ters. The list now comprises about: 
twenty American and foreign craft. 

Names of vessels suspected of whis- 
ky smuggling operations, officials said, 
are reported to headquarters by field 
agents and a list of the suspected 
craft is forwarded at intervals to 
prohibition directors of the states 
bordering on the Atlantic, Pacific and 
Gulf coast to aid them in their ac- 
tivities against the illegal entry of | 
liquor into this country. 

One of the chief difficulties met by 
the bureau was said to be the facili- 
ty with which these craft change their 
names. ‘ 

The Messenger of Peace is among 
the suspected smuggling craft listed 
by the department, officials said,

People of Munich 
Protest American 
Background in. Play 


Berlin, January 11.—(By the Asso- 
ciated Press.)—Munich theater-goers 
are still touchy on the subject of 
America, it appears from an incident 
just reported here. 

The Neue Berlinger Zeitung tells 
how an audience in the Bavarian ‘cap- 
ital fairly raised the roof in objecting 
to the American background and Amer- 
ican names being used in a new theat- 
rical production, They hoeted and 
hissed and stamped, and finally the 
performance was brofight to a stop. 

The authorities, when the manager 
was brought before them, forbade him 
from producing the play unless the 
scenes were placed in some other coun- 
try than the United States. The ver- 
satile producer readily complied and 
laid his scenes in the Caucasus. The 
name of one character was changed | 
from “Smith” to Smirski,“ and that 
of “Gladys Chicago, dollar princess,” 
to Marsha Petrograd, millionaire's 
daughter.“ 

The metamorphosed play was a suc- 
cess. :

New York, January 11.—The cake-

cleaned, kissed, coddled and wumpsey- 
dumpsied by their mammas, are hold- 
ing a cat convention upon the waldorf

sneering at the whole proceeding, is 
the unhappiest cat in town, suffering 
from the name of Tibbles,“ a re-

polish off any dozen of those soft, fat, 
aristocrats who ignore his presence 
at the united cat show. It may not 
be decent, but any grown kid who ever 
get out a saucer of milk for a gaunt

with embroidered centers in the same 
Dresden garlands. The places were 
marked by little notes on hand-deco-

personal message to each ‘guest. 

After luncheon Mrs. Cheers sang, 
by request, Miss Stephens’ “Federation 
Hymn,” which was dedicated to the

Saturday Matinee 


By Illingworth 
To Be Big Event 


The second of the series of matinee- 
teas under the auspices of the Atlanta 
Music club, will be an event of Sat- 
urday afternoon at 3:30 o’clock at 
Egieston hall, 

An artist of the first magnitude will | 
present the program— Nelson IIling- 
worth, Australian baritone, and in- 
terpreter of songs, who holds a place 
on the concert stage not surpassed by 
that of any concert singer at present 
appearing before the American public. 
And there are few great artists whose 
work America is failing of opportunity 
to enjoy. 

The methods used by this uncom- 
mon artist are not easy to describe 
in words, says a commentator, but they 
are based on the very sound theory 
that in the interpretations of songs 
the voice and the tones which issue 
from it are, like the music of the song 
itself, mearly a medium, merely a 
means by which the dramatic or emo- 
tional content of @ song is illustrated 
and intensified. In other words, in 


‘a song which is worth while, the first 


street complimenting Miss Wil 


element to be considered is the pic-, 
ture that the poem depicts and all 
other things are subordinate to it. All 
the great composers have stressed this 
attitude and now comes Mr. Illing- 
worth to demonstrate it. 

Krehbiel, in The Tribune, spoke of 
his gripping “the imagination and 
emotions of the hearers ina degree 
that no song singer of recent years 
has exerted.” Finck, in The Evening 
Post, declared that he “had not been 
so stirred and thrilled for a long time,” 
and hailed Mr. Lilingworth as “the 
great song interpreter with a mes- 
sage. Saying that “his singing of the 
Erlking was most thrilling in its un- 
earthly atmosphere. it made one’s 
spine ereep, one’s eyes fill by its tre- 
mendous motional appeal and that 
“very few artists possess the great gift 
of expression which makes its possible 
for the Australian singer to carry a 
program through without for a mo- 
ment losing the audience’s interest.” 

Mr. Illingworth’s recital will be an 
event of the Music club’s series in- 
time. 

The concert will be followed by aft- 
ernoon tea with the officers of the 
club forming a hospitality committee. 
It is probable that Mr. Illingworth 
will remain to meet the company. 
All the patrons of the event are in- 
vited to remain. :

A dear old friend of mine is about 
to enter an old folk's home. 

She is to have a pleasant room, she 
is to go back to the town where she 
was brought up and where several of 
her oldest friends still live, she is to 
be freed from the struggle to make 
both ends meet by ber work, a task 
which rising prices, hard times, and 
her own lessening strength made a 
losing struggle. 

And I am thankful to add that she 
is very happy over it. 

Her attitude makes me admire that 
woman even more than I always have, 
and that is saying a good deal. 

Not One Atom of False Pride. 

She comes from a fine family. I 
doubt if one of them ever went to an 
old folks home before, but she has 
not one atom of false pride. 

She knows that she has done her 
share of the world’s work, that she 
has never faltered before hard work 
or work of any sort that she was able 
to do. She knows that as a girl she 
gave many of the productive years. of 
her life to taking care of an invalid 
mother. Had she worked at any 
other work as hard, and stinted her- 
self as strictly, as she did in those 
years she might have saved enough 
money so that she would not have had 
to go into the old folks home. But she 
did her duty then and the world owes 
her care now. 

Taking What Belongs to Her. 

She is not accepting charity (of 
course, the home is not wholly sup- 
ported by what those who enter turn 


over to it), she is merely ing what 
is her right—belp from others as 
she gave help to others. 

I heard of a case the other day of 
a woman who could not 127 a job in 
ber regular line of work and who, 
rather. than take a housework job 
(which she was perfectly able to han- 
die), let her mother go to the alms- 
house. That’s the opposite of this 
state of mind. That woman had every 
ereason to be ashamed, far more than 
if she had taken a housework posi- 
tion. 

I have always claimed that I should 
not be ashamed to go to the poor- 
nouse provided that I had not been 
afraid to do my duty to those who 
needed my help, had worked hard, 
and saved what I should. Then if 
some fnisfortune landed me in the 
poorhouse I should not blame myself, 
and hence would not need to be 
ashamed. we 

We Can’t Always Predict. 

I do not say I should like it, and 
perhaps if it happened I should feel 
shame, too. Our feelings are not al- 
ways governed by reason. But I don’t 
think I would have any reason to. 

And I don’t think anyone who ac- 
cepts help in time of need ought to 
feel amy sense of shame provided that 
when they were able they had done 
all they could to help themselves. In 
fact, I think there are times when it 
is very wrong not to accept help and 
to accept it cheerfully.

A good broom is a rather expensive

cently appointed to confer with the |v ything to prolong its life it is 


well worth the little extra time and

Members of executive board, State Federation of Music clubs, which held session in Atlanta Wednesday. Left to right, 
standing: Mrs. T. R. Lane, of Macon; Mrs. T. J. Durrett, of Cordele; Miss Nan Stephens, of Atlanta, president of the South 
Atlantic district, Federation of Music clubs; Miss Evelyn Jackson, of Atlanta; Mrs. Charles Dowman, of Atlanta: Miss Ella 


Neal, of Cartersville; seated, Mrs. F. G. Bailey, of Savannah; and Mrs. F. E 
Georgia Federation of Music clubs. 


A Caruso memorial program by 
every music club in Georgia was 
pledged yesterday by the executive 
board, Georgia Federation of Music 
Clubs, at its meeting in Atlanta. 

The morning session was held at 
Steinway hall, Phillips & Crew’s. The 
meeting adjourned at 1 p. m. for lunch- 
eon with Miss Nan Stephens, president 
South Atlantic District Federation, 
which is the “southeastern ‘section of 
the national body, and the afternoon 
business session was also held at 
Miss Stephens’ home. 

At 5 o’clock the board members were 
the guests of Miss Evelyn Jackson, 
junior director for the state, at tea 
at her home. 

In the evening, the out-of-town 
members of the board were the guests 
of the all-star concert management at 
the Rachmaninoff concert, and Mrs. 
Charles Dowman, president of the At- 
lanta Music club, invited those who 
remained in Atlanta to be the guests 
of the club at the Illingsworth concert 
Saturday afternoon. 

Another business session will be 
held Thursday morning at Edison hall. 


Prominent Women Present. 


The board members’ present were 
Mrs. F. E. Vassiere, of Rome, state 
president; Mrs. F. G. Bailey, of Sa- 
vannah, first vice president; Mrs. T. 
R. Lane, of Macon, second vice presi- 
dent; Mrs, T. J. Durrett, of Cordele, 
state treasurer; Miss Evelyn Jackson, 


* 


of Atlanta, junior director; Mrs. 
Charles E. Dowman, of Atlanta, state 
chairman of program, and Miss Nan 
Stephens, of Atlanta, president south 
Atlantic district. 

Miss Ella Neel, of Cartersville, who 
expects to organize a music club in 
her city, and Mrs. W. O. Chears, of 
Atlanta, who sang delightfully at the 
time of the luncheon, were the guests 
at the luncheon. 

The decision toi promote Caruso 
memorial concerts was in answer to 
a request from Colonel W. L. Peel, 
southern member of the Caruso Me- 
morial foundation. Miss Stephens an- 
no that similar memorials could 
also be arranged by the federated mu- 
sic clubs in the three other states 
from.the South Atlantic district. 

The board agreed to disseminate 
literature through the federated clubs 
concerning the April season of grand 
opera in Atlanta. It was a happy 
circumstance that the motion to take 
this action was seconded by Mrs. 
Lane, member of the board from Ma- 
con, which has its own annual music 
festival. 

National Leader Coming. 

In addition to reports and discus- 
sions concerning federation work, 
much time was devoted to planning 


‘of the State Fedération meeting to 


be held in Cordele, March 15-18. 
The E guest of that oc- 

casion will the president of the 

National Federation, Mrs. John M. 


worth while, 


Lyons, of Fort Worth, Texas. It is 
a possibility also that Mrs. F. A. 
Sieberling, of Akron, Ohio, who pre- 
ceded Mrs. Lyons as the head of na- 
tional body, may attend. 

Features of the state convention 
will be a program devoted to the work 
of Georgia composers, and the junior 
music contest, which is sponsored by 
the national federation. In addition 
to the piano and violin contests hith- 
erto conducted, there will be added 
this year a voice contest. 

The district meeting and contest 
will be held in Miami immediately 
after the Georgia meeting, when the 
state women in Georgia will com- 
pete with the winners from the other 
states of the district. The district’ 
winners will take part later in a 
national contest and the award to the 
national ‘winners will be exceptionally 
including not only 
prizes, but the opportunity for schol- 
arships with the most noted teach- 
ers in the country and concert en- 
gagements. 

Biennial in Asheville. 

Plans are also being formulated by 
the Georgia board for its part in the 
entertainment of the biennial of the 
national federation. This is dated 
for June, 1923, but since it takes 
place within the South Atlantic dis 
trict—in Asheville, N. C.—work is 
already beginning in order that all 
the states of this district may make 
the best showing possible in number 


. Vaissiere, of Rome, state president of the 


of clubs federated and in program 
contributions. 

A state orchestra was one of the 
plans suggested in the Georgia board 
meeting. Groups of musicians, both 
from the senior and junior clubs 
would be trained at home in the 
same selections, and then be brought 
together for combined rehearsal at the 
state meeting and then at the bien- 


* nial. 


Mrs..T. J. Durrett, who extended the 
invitation from Cordele for the state 
convention, named the three Music 
clubs of her city as the hostess clubs. 
They are the Cordele Symphony club, 
the Symphonia club {made up of young 
ladies), and the Junior Symphony. 
They are planning combined work in 
an orchestra. 

Among the movements of public in- 
terest which were discussed or acted 
upon at the board meeting it proposed 
legislation looking to the establish- 
ment of the office of state supervisor 
of music in the schools, and the crea- 
tion of a sentiment for music credits 
in the schools; the encouragement in 
all federated clubs of student aid loans, 
like those being started by the Hijeck- 
ha club, of Macon; the entension of 
junior work, which has its highest ex- 
pression in the work of Atlanta’s 
Junior Music club, and the encourage- 
ment of musical composition by Geor- 
gians, with the provision of public 
opportunity for hearings of these com- 
positions.

A BEAUTY CH 


A man wrote me a letter the other 
day and suggested that a few talks on 


improving health and personal appear- 


ance might be written for men as well 
as women, “I’ve seen lots of things 
that I could use,“ he wrote. Every- 
time my wife finds a suggestion that 
she thinks I need she always reads it 
to me.“ 

So this Chat today is written par- 
ticularly for masculine readers. Now 
a common masculine affliction is bald- 
ness, which is quite unnecessary if a 
man only knew how to stop it in 
time. When the actual roots of the 
hair die, there is of course no hope of 
growing new hair over a bald spot. 
But it takes more years than you think 
to kill the roots, and it is not until the 
bald part of the scalp is as hard and 
— on a piece of polished glass that 
one should give up hope of growing 
new -hair. 

A friend of mine came to me last 
summer for the Pilocarpine hair tonic. 
She had it made up and had her hus- 
band use it. He was a fairly young 
man and was rapidly getting bald, and 
because of this he looked ten years 
older than his actual age. Shortly after 
she took the formula they moved away 
and I have not seen them since, but 
she wrote me yesterday that her hus- 
band’s hair is much thicker and that 
new hairs are coming in over the bald 

laces. He had been using the tonic 
aithfully for several months. 

This is only another, proof of the 
goodness of this special tonic which I 
personally consider to be the very best 
formula. If the hair is kept thoroughly 
clean, if it is shampooed with a good 
soap, if the scalp is massaged and heat- 
ing hats are not worn, the use of this 


AT FOR MEN 
tonié will be doubly effective. If you 


haven’t the formula for _ tonic, 
write me and I will gladly mail it to 


vou. 


Miss M. S.: If you will send me a 
letter with a self-addressed stamped 
envelope inclosed, I will mail you the 
formula for a harmless fattening tonic 
which will enlarge the bust. 

A. G.: Scars left from boils on the 
face will be very hard to remove, but 
if you are in perfect health now, you 
can have as good a skin as you desire 
dy going to a little extra trouble every 


day. I would advise the following 


Rub cleansing cream into 
off with a dry cloth. 
e face with the white of 


treatment? 
the face, wi 
Then cover 

an diluted with water, one part 
ene ten parts of water. Let, this 
stand on tor 15 minutes. Wash off 
with hot water. Massage in a nourish- 
ing cold cream with an electric vi- 
bratok, if you can get one. Wipe off 
the Surplus cream and rub the face 
with a piece of ice, 

This is a very stimulating face treat- 
ment which will take you at least 35 
minutes every day, but if you persist 
in it and if your health is really good, 
your skin will become perfect. 

Tomorrow—A Suggestion, 

All inquiries addressed to Miss 
Forbes in care of the “Beauty Chats” 
department will be answered in these 
columps in their turn. This requires 
considerable time, however, owing to 
the great number received. So if a 
personal or quicker reply is desired, a 
stamped — self-addressed envelope 
must be enclosed with the question.—

engagement, Henry Harrison tele- 
phones. | 
He informs Jeanne that he can Lor- 
row nothing on her worthless land. 


Selby North, gossiping, elderly 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barstowe's 
many flirtations. 


Harrison comes to breakfast to ar- 
range for the transfer of property, 
and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents him as a business ac- 
quaintance. 

Canby offers a “market tip“ as a 
means for Jeanne to make some 
money. 

She . arranges the party so that 
she drives to the Forbes’ in Bar- 
stowe’s car and Jeanne goes ahead 
with a man named f'arnham. 

At the dance that night Jeanne 
using indifference to bait Barstowe, 
succeeds in angering him. 

She learns that Vera is a formida- 
ble rival, being a lifelong acquaint- 
ance much favor by Barstowe’s 
family because of hér blue-blooded an- 
cestry. 

On her return to town Jeanne is 
presented with a at cheque by Canby 
as the result of her successful gamble. 


Installment No. 24.

MY WIFE? 

When her telephone rang at 3 that 
afternoon, Jeanne crossed the room 
without haste and picked up the in- 
strument as. languidly as if she had 
not been waiting fearfully with cold- 
tensely-clenched hands. 

“Yes?” she drawled into the receiver 
with her pretty upward inflection. 

“Miss Dare?’ 

Her heart, which had seemed to 
stand still while she awaited the an- 
swering voice, began to beat again. 

“Yes,” she admitted, and kept her- 
self from saying, “Oh! is that you, 
Mr. Barstowe?” She wanted him to 
think that he was not the only man

and waited. 


“Oh, yes, Mr. Barstowe,” she said 
coolly. “I received your message

when I got home from the country. 
So sorry to have missed you.” 

She purposely made the expression 
of regret sound the most insincere of 
conventional phrases. 


“Are you busy?“ he disconcertal 
her with his abruptness. : 

“Why—I,” she was beginning hetp- 
lessly. 

“That means you're not,” he re- 
plied brusquely. “I want to see you 
—badly. Will you let me drop up 
there for a few minutes right away!? 

“Why—I—” she was beginning 
again. 

“I'll be there in fifteen minutes,” 
he said and — — his receiver. 

For a moment Jeanne gasped. Then 
a little gleam came into her eyes. 

She was winning! She could feel 
the turn in the tide. 


Fifteen minutes! Good heavens, 
she had barely time to dress! She 
flew into her bedroom, and, ripping 
off her gown, sipped into a tea gown, 
a lovely affair of white chiffon and 
pearl chains. In it she looked, with 
her blonde hair and rose-leaf coloring, 
like a lovely, white angel who had 
taken an ro wal off from heaven.

“This is a surprise—naturally,” she 
said, when he had laid aside his coat 
and hat and seated himself, drawing 
his chair close to hers. 

“I know,” he looked down for a 
moment, and then burst out, as if he 
could no longer keep it repressed. 
“I’ve been an awful ass, Miss Dare! 
I’ve acted like a, baby! I’m heartily 
ashamed of myself, I confess it.” 

Jeanne raised polite brows. Her

clusion of another kind of wrap, 
they are put as backgrounds to the 
new spring frocks that go south and 
return north with an air of freshness 
as if to say “here we are, brand new, 
just out of tissne paper.” A neat fib, 
this, but women are so mentally ad- 
justed that whenever a fashion appears 
at the exact moment the climate de- 
mands it, they are insistent that it has 
just arrived. It is for such reasons 
that a clever editor of a women’s 
magazine says it is quite as bad to be 
in front of the fashion as behind it. 


Regardless of the needs of the fig- 
ure, the short cape is a means of pro- 
viding a colorful. background for a 
combre gown and just there does it 
find its place in an evening gown. The 
fashion for bodices with high trans- 
parent backs gives another excuse for

more tired than 1 thought. Nothing 
but fatigue could account for my

He smiled his brilliant smile, and 


held out a ready hand. 


“Friends again?“ he queried. 

She laid hers into it, and he crushed 
her slim fingers for a moment before 
he dropped them. Then he leaned 
back with a deep-drawn sigh. 

“Feel better now,” he declared. It's 
worried me all day—and all yesterday 
afternoon, too. At first, I didn’t know 
why I felt so rotten, and then I sud-

me. Lord, I was grouchy yesterday.

HOME TALENT PLAYS 


Scene: Living room of the Palmer 
home. The davenport, easy chair, 
and the grandfather’s clock are the 
‘ ters. A boy or girl concealed 
behind each of these articles does the 
speaking. As the scene.opens, the 
room is in half darkness, with only a 
floor lamp lit. 

Davenport (in deep, slow voice): 
Seems mighty lonesome in here. 
We're left alone most of the time. 

Easy Chair (in smooth, soft tone): 


That’s right. 1 hate being deserted | 


so much. It didn't use to be this way, 

Clock (in measured, monotonous 
tones): It makes me feel pretty badly 
when I think of the happy family 
gatherings 1 uve seen in my long 
life—chiidren who have grown up and 
formed family circles of their own. 
A long, iong time. A long, long time. 

Easy Chair: Sometimes Mrs. Palm- 
er sits here a while and sews snd 
reads, but she gets sestless nd finally 
goes off to bed. Every night end 
every night those two are off some- 
where. 

Davenport: It isn’t as if Marjory 
and Tommy Palmer were two wild 
young people who liked to run around 
with rough gangs at night. The-trou- 
ble is they don’t kaow how to spend 
a pleasant evening at home. They 
have to be off to the movies, or off 
studying with some of their friends, or 
up in their rooms muking something. 
They see each other only at meal time. 

Clock: It wasn’t that way in the 
old days. It wasn't that way in the 
old days. 

Easy Chair: I feel sorry for their 
mother. Since their father is away 
so much, you'd think her children 
would try to entertain her. But, no, 
sir! And she lets them go most of 
the time, because.she is afraid they’ll 
think they're being “held down” at 
home. She doesn’t want to nag at 


hard to manage. 

Davenport: I wonder if there isn’t 
something we-can do? 

Easy Chair: I tell you what. We'll 
try to look just as inviting as we 
possibly can tonight when. they come 
in here after dinner. I'll look cozy 
and sink-into-able. 

Davenport: And I'll be my softest 
and most tempting to a nap. 

Clock: And I'll sound as 
fortable and home-like as I can. 

Davenport: And the light is so 
soft and comfy tonight. It ought to

Marjory: ‘That clock. It’s a funny

“Glad to meet you,” said Mr. Hend-

But Miss Lee continued to look

“Yep, in the locker room where it

The Children’s 
Hour 


ae 


Cv 


Many of the outdoor games which 
children love can be carried into the 
home. This means more enjoyment 
for the children and more leisure for 
the mother on a rainy day. 

A good game for this purpose is 
“Hopscotch.” The chicken usually 
mark off the spaces with chalk on 
the sidewalk. To mlay it indoors 
mark off the spaces in the same way 
on a large piece of plain-colored oil- 
cloth, or the back of an old piece. 
This can be done with black paint. 
The sheet can be pinned to the car- 
pet or tacked to the floor with thumb 
tacks, The game is played in the 
same way as outdoors. Where oilcloth 
cannot be obtained, a large sheet of 
heavy wrapping paper will do.

platter dinner“ is- gaining approval in 
many households where each dinner is 
sent in from the kitchen on its own hot 
plate. But, wherever the older cus- 
tom of. passing dishes still prevails at 
a family table, the mother and father 
have the first helping, then the dishes 
are passed to the juniors. Meat is 
frequently served alone on the heated 
plates after the soup plates have been 
removed from euch place. Salad. also, 
may be in individual dishes, so that it 
is necessary to pass only the vegetables, 
the bread and the condiments. 

The usual form of request for pass- 
ing sauce, relishes, seasoning, etc., is, 
“May I trouble you for the vinegar?” 
(for instance). But, where everyone 
at the table. pays attention to the 
wants of everyone else, any such re- 
quest should be unnecessary, especial- 
ly on the part of a woman or an in- 
vited guest, whose wants should al- 
ways be anticipated.

their way.

Using’ every caution against sur-

out of the country. It was by a mere 
chance that Markham, who belo 
to the Camberwell outfit, was caught 
red-handed tonight. 

There was a movement out beyond 
the radius of the fire. Two of the 
Circle O men came riding in, and be- 
tween them was another horse and 
rider, lagging and silent, at sight of 
whom Billie Stranger’s heart gave a 
quick bound; then sank. , 

“It’s Little Britches,” one of the 
newcomers explained to his boss. “We 
found her out yonder snoopin’ around 
among the hosses. She had the sorrel 
boss roped to a tree.” 

Billie and Jack believed that they 
alone knew of her presence in the 
valley, but now they saw that every 
one had known it. Patten sent an 
angry look toward his men who had 
been too officious. 

“Well, bring her in,” he. command-

The valley was a miniature place, 
When they reached its decline they 
could see the campfire of the rustlers 
and two or three figures lounging 
around it. Billie and Patten took the 
lead and with their men close behind 
them rode rapidly into the midst of 
men and cattle before their presence 
was suspected. 

“We've come after our stock, |

Many Championship Rit Ring Ba ttles 
In Store for New York’s Fandom 


Frank Baker Won’ t Sides 
His Usual Retirement 
Stunt During This Cam- 


paign. 


New York, January 11.—Champion- 
ship fights will soon become common 
as alley wrangles in New York. The 
bantam title has been in the ring 
twice since early fall, once when Pete 
Herman lost it to Johnny Buff, and 
again when Buff defended the crown 
against Jack Sharkey. 


On January 31, Jack - Britton will 


defend .the welterweight championship 
against Dave Shade, of Calofirnia, 
and on the tenth of February Benny 
Leonard will become defendant in 
some pugilistic activity with an op- 
ponent not yet elected. 

Lew Tendler, Rocky Kansas, Char- 
lie White and Joe benjamin are the 
eligible challengers for Leonard's ti- 
tle, , 

Britton will fight three times for 
Tex Rickard, and Leonard, also, prob- 
ably will accept at east one other 
battle. 

And when Johnny Buff returns 
from his tour of F~-" be will prob- 
ably agree to battle Midget Smith. 
Bat Levinsky’s light heavyweight ti- 
tle is at stake in Friday’s fight with 
Gene Tunney. Johnny Kilbane and 
Johnny Wilson are the only champions 
whom there is no hope of luring into 
the ring, Kilbane because he won't, 
Wilson because he can’t fight. Jack 
Dempsey stands ready to work any 
time an opponent can be found. 


TECH CAGERS 
LOOK BETTER 


BY JOHN STATON. 

Although the weather and wind 
were not kind to the best interests of 
basketball, the Tech crew got consid- 
erable of a workout yesterday. It 
was simply a case of have pep or 
freeze. And the large part of them 
had the ginger. The varsity started 
off with a little bout against the 
freshmen. 

The team looks a good bit better at 
the present writing than it did this 
time last week. The passwork has 
become more accurate, and the eye for 
the basket a little better. In general, 
the teamwork is becoming more no- 
ticéable, The fellows are beginning 
to find each other on the court. One 
of the best features of the day was the 
way the defense was working. Tech 
uses the five-man system of defense, 
one whieh is excellent once perfected, 
but one taking considerable practice 
to perfect. . 

Strips Defense. 

Very rarely did the freshmen carry 
the ball through the network, and 
when. they did, they were usually 
stopped before the basket had been 
rung. Defense in basketball, as in 
football, is more than half the game. 
What good comes if you shoot one 
basket and then allow the opponents, 
to shoot two? Since none of the fel- 
lows on the team is a remarkable 
shot, it behooves them to build up a 
good defense, which they have done. 


Second varsity against the second He scored 20 pomts 


freshmen team was the next event on 
the program. Both teams cut up like | 
regular folks, and had a good time. 
And then came the varsity again 
against the elephants. All the mem- 
bers of the elephant team brought 
horseshoes to practice, and were able. |! 
due to the effect of the horeshoes, 
to give the varsity a nice scrap. The 
varsity won the game by about four 
points, 

If the team can hold the pace they 
have set so far, there’s no doubt but 
what they will come through in fine 


thane when they meet the B. A. C. | 
Friday night and U. of Ala. Saturday. 


ELDER’S DOG 
WINS DERBY 


Grand Junction, Tenn., January 
11.-—Outbirding Trimble’s Mr. Jim, 
Duquesne Nell, pointer, owned by J. 
H. Elder, Pittsburg, Pa., won the 
derby of the United States field trials 
bere late today by the narrowest of 
margins. Trimble’s Mr. Jim’s pointer, 
owned by Matthew Trimble, Jr., Ken- 
sington, Md., was a close second, with 
Chera, pointer owned. by Herbert 
Ames, LaGrange, Tenn., third. 

The two leaders battled through 
an hour of hard going in the final 
beat, running at full speed to the end. 
The Duquesne Nell's fifth win of this 
season. Trimble's Mr. Jim failed to 
find birds in the second series, al- 
though he showed -he could handle 
game in the first heat. Chera was 
rood on game, but lacked the speed 
and range of the two dogs placed 
above her. 

Following the decision of the derby 
the running of the all-age stake was 
begun and will be completed tomor- 
row. There are twenty-nine entrants 
in the stake. Among those who show- 
ed excellent form in their first heat 
todax were Doughboy, pointer owned 
by E. J. Rowe, Birmingham, Ala. ; 
Hugene Momoney, setter, owned by C. 
H. Tyler, Boston, Mass.; Chester Val- 
ley Blue, setter, owned by E. A. 
Watson, Roanoke, Va., and the setter 
Fugene’s Ghost, owned by W. W. 
Stoner, Courtland, Miss. The last 
damed do og, which has been known as 

a “bolter,” proved a sensational per- 
13 under the handling of J. M. 
Avent, of Hickory Valley, Tenn., 
making four distinct finds of birds 
and the sticking close to the course. 
The all-age stake will be completed

BY BILLIE FREEMAN. 
Tuscaloosa, Ala., January 11.— 
(Special.)—The B. A. C. game having 
beeome history, the Crimson cage ar- 
tists are now priming up for the clash 


with Georgia Tech’s quint, which will 
take place here Saturday night. In 
the B. A. C. game some of the highest 
type of basketball ever seen here was 
witnessed, proving the fact that a new 
era in the winter game has now ar- 
rived at the university. Basketball ha 
now established its place along wit 
football and baseball in the interest of 
the fans. 

The mid-year examinations which 
are now in progress at the university 
are seriously interfering with practiee 
this week, which is made more serious 
because of the game with Tech sched-

SMITHIES WIN 
FROM AGOGAS 


The Tech High basketball five de- 
feated the Agoga quintet on the Boys’ 
High court Wednesday night in one 
of the hardest-fought games of the 

ractice season. The final score was: 

ech High, 30; Agoga, 24. Captain 
Richardson, of the Tech High team, 
was the shining light of the victory. | 
for his mates. 

The long-distance shooting of Rich- 
ardson was the feature of the game. 
Time after time he would be open in 
the center of the court, and no way to 
get near the goal, beeause the Agoga 
team was using the five-man defense. 
Then he would shoot’ from the center 
of the floor. The majority of his 
long shots counted for 2 points. 
Richardson was splendid when it came 
to shooting foul goals. 

Five-Man Defense. 

The Tech High team used the five- 
man defense system, and certainly 
usedittoan advantage. The Agoga 
team had only a few real good shots, 
and took advantage: of practically. 
everyone of them. The passing of 
the Tech High team was another fea- 
ture of the game, especially when in 
center of the court. 

Wilkinson and Liddell played the 
best game for the Agoga team. Both 
these men were all over the court prac- 
tically all the time. The Agoga team 
also used the five-man defense, but the 
Tech High team showed clearly that 
they had had more practicing this 
season. 

The first half ended with the score: 
Tech High, 21; Agoga, 15. Towards the 
beginning of the second half, the Agoga 
team sprang a surprise and ran the 
score up to a 24 to 23 count before 
the Tech High five had realized it. 
The Tech High team, by a spurt, be- 
gan passing accurately and pulled 
away from the Sunday school team.

Love Gave Way 
To Hate, Claim 
In Barch Trial 


Los Angeles, Cal., January 11— 
Letters which Mrs. Madalynne Oben- 
chain wrote to J. Belton Kennedy 
formed the basis for an attack upon 
the “foundation of the prosecution’s 
case“ in the argument today by John 
J. Sullivan, counsel. for Arthur C. 
Burch on trial in the Los Angeles 
superior court, charged with-the mur- 
der of Kennedy. 

The letters, most of which contain- 
ed expressions of extreme affection, 
had been introduced as evidence by 
the prosecution and many of them 
were quoted by Asa Keyes, deputy 
district attorney, in the opening argu- 
ment by the state. Mr. Keyes’ argued 
they showed Mrs. Obenchain's love 
turned to hate, that other evidence 
showed she summoned Burch to Los 
Angeles from Evanston, III., and that} 
Burch at. her instigation, shot Ken- 
nedy to death. 

Mr. Sullivan told the jury be be- 
lieved the letters indicated love which’ 
endured to the end. He declared he 
did not think any reasonable person 
could read them and come to the con- 


ed of harming Kennedy. 

“She wrote to Kennedy: ‘I would 
give my life for you,' the attorney. 
declared. She signed one letter: 
‘Your’s to the end,’ and we have the 
testimony of a witness who saw her 
in Beverly Glen when Kennedy was 
pronounced dead and who heard he 
say: ‘Belton, why did they do it? 
She was indeed his to the end.” 

Mr. Sullivan stated he would end 


According to the — the men 
gave their names as John Tracey, off 
New Orleans, and John Butler who 
is registered at a local hotel. 

Telephone wires leading to the hay- 
loft aroused the suspicions of Police 
Corporal Hattier, stationed at the 
track. As the last race was being 
finished today Hattier climbed into 
the haylof and reported that he found 
one. of. the. men had field glasses on 
the horses while the other was at the 


telephone in communication with New 


ork. 

“Butler and Tracey, according te the 
police, said they had been usin the 
hayloft and telet hone to make “sure- 
thing” bets in New York. As soon 
as a horse won a race, the police said, 
the winner would be given over the 
telephone to New York and a bet 
on the horse made in that city. 

The men were charged with being 
dangerous. and suspicious characters.

tional bank, or Verdun or 
something else impregnable of Atlan- 
ta finance. 

In reading the list, Atlantans paused

denly tak hig position in this 
Academy Monetaried Immortals. 

And the funny part about it was

GREAT DISCLOSURE 

For—now here is the disclosure— 
L. W. Robert, Jr., is none other than 
Chip Robert—by gosh, why didn’t I 
think of that before; of course it’s 
Chip. 

Wherefrom many lessons may be 
drawn. For you can lay to it that 
Chip Robert was not elected a member 
of the board of directors of the Fourth 
National bank because he had a nick- 
name and because he has an immense 
‘personal popularity around Atlanta 
and because he has worked in season

organizations fn, which be he takes a deep 
and abiding interest. 
ELECTION SIMPLE 
AND LOGICAL CONCLUSION 

He was elected to the directorate 
because, despite of all these interests, 
he has not overlooked — fact that 
his principal endea vor and purpose in 
lite was to build solidly in a business 
way, and his achievements along these 
lines have been such that his election 
‘to the directorate aforementioned was 
a Simple and logical conclusion. 

Everybody in Atlanta knows about 
chips athletic career at Tech. They 
‘also know that he is a trustee of that 
institution. and as such has always 
acted with broad vision and high busi- 
ness acumén. They know that he has 
‘been for years alumni director of ath- 
leties and as such has brought ath- 


Georgia Tec 

But a lot of jople do not, know 
& Co., architects. and engineers, who. 
have built up a business right in At- 
lanta that extends in its varieus rami- 
fications not only throughout the en- 
tire south, but to every section of the 
country. 

The Fourth National bank people 
did know this, 2 and accordingly 
they elected W. Robert to the 
board of ei and I guess we'll 
have to start calling Chip “Mr. Rob- 
ert” or “Mr. L. W.“ or “Mr. Some-

SECONDROUND 


BY ABE NISSENBAUM. 

The second round in the American 
and National basketball leagues of 
the Jewish Progressive club was 
played Tuesday night. 

The American league Yankees de- 
feated the Indians by a score of 26 
to 18. Litch, of the Yanks, was the 
individual star of the game, shooting 
22 points. For the Indians the work 
of Klutz could not be overlooked. 

In the National league the Cardi- 
nals swamped the Cubs by the score of 
24 to 11. The poor showing of the 
Cubs could be partly attributed to 
the fact that their forward, Meltzer, 
was knocked coo-coo ‘at the beginning 
of the second half. Markales at 
guard for the losers was undoubtedly 
the star of the night's play, playing 
the floor in jam-up style and shoot- 


ing practically all of his team’s points. 
For the Cardinals Captain Hertzen- 
burg covered himself with glory and 
perspiration by his fine playing. The 
work of Russ at center was also com- 
mendable. 

The Cardinals and. Pirates are tied 
for the top honors in the National 
league, while the Yanks and Senators 
are tied for the leadership in the 
American league.

London, Januar 11.— Boxing skill 
is a three-to-one ayorite over brute 
strength and endurance in the fight 
between Georges Carpentier, light 
heavyweight champion of the word, 

and George Cook, the Australian 
2 in Albert hall Thursday 
night. The odds were three to two 
on Carpentier until Wednesday eve- 
ning, when the Cook money, which 
has never been very bold, became even 
more scarce. Then the Carpentier 
men went about the public places of- 
fering three to one on the Frenchman. 

Both fighters have issued the cus- 
tomary statements. Pink of condition 
—win by a knockout—no excuse to 
offer if defeated—these are old fa- 
miliar phrases reiterated by both 
camps. 

Francois .Descamps, Carpentier's 
manager, was about London Wednes- 
day evening claiming his man -was 
pounds heavier than when he forght 
Jack Dempsey, and in even better con- 
dition. ‘The entire seating capacity 
.of Albert hall has been sold out, and 


| which was the masterpiece of English 
exploitation. 

Old Jack McAuliffe, the retired, un- 
defeated lightweight champion, after 
looking over the fighters at the con- 
clusion of their training, predicts that 
Carpentier will win easily. Jack had 
looked for improvement in Cook along 
toward the end of the Australian’s 
training. He has failed to note this 
improvement, however, and believes 
Carpentier can end the bout when- 
ever he chooses to shoot his right fist 
for Cook’s jaw. 

McAuliffe agrees with Descamps 
‘that Carpentier is in better shape now 
than he was just before the fight 
with Dempsey.

One of the tremendous developments 
in sport has been the spread of foot - 
ball throughout the south. Dixie nev- 
er has been a great baseball section, | au, 
although perhaps it has more real 
‘sportsmen and sport lovers in propor- 
tion to „ than here else 
in the ited States. Conditions were 
always against baseball te, the 


game, 

and, worse than that, the fact that 
for many years the southern cities 
were the chief spor grounds of 
northern promoters. e southern. 
cities that tried baseball for many 
years drew~a bad class of northern 
professional players. I have seen the 
game ruined in many places by the 
rowdyism and worse of cheap profes- 
sionals. Naturally they drew the ele- 
ments, and the real people refused to 
patronize the sport, and, as. the real 
people had the money, it could not 
prosper. 
Football, however, has seized upon 
all Dixie, and as a sport it has be- 
come the leading one. There is a cus-

BIG SMOKER 


BY FUZZY WOODRUFF. 
Members of the Jewish Progressive 
club held their first smoker under 


the administration of their new offi- 


cers, celebrating the event with as 
fine and varied an athletic program 
as any Atlanta organization has ever 
offered. 

Incidentally Mendel Romm, presi- 
ent of the organization, announced 
that the policy of his administra- 
tion would be for a furtherance of 
athletic interests in every branch of 
sport. A club basketball league has 
been formed with eight teams, which 
play weekly: matches. The club team 


as head of football, baskethall antl 


has already booked several games and 
will book #thers as the season pro- 
gresses. “We intend to make this 
club known athletically, not only in 


Atlanta, but throughout the south,“ 


said President Romm, and an answer- 
ing cheer told him that his club mem- 
bers were behind him. 

A movement is already under way 
looking toward an enlargement of 
the present commodious and well 
equipped gymnasium. The club re- 
cently celebrated the burning of the 
mortgage on its handsome club house 
at 270 South Pryor street and it is be- 
lieved that it will soon be in position 
to achieve the fondest ambitions of 
its membership. 

The club house was filled for the 
entertainment last nigbt, mot only 
with members, but with the older 
folks and wives and sweethcarts and 
everybody appeared to enjoy every 
number on the program, particularly 
a blackfaced act by Abe Nissenbaum, 
Lilliputian gees and financier, 
who stopped the show when he sang 
“Strutters’ Ball” in Yiddish, and a 
violin act by the talented and win- 
some Miss Inez Marvin. 

The athletic features were a wrest- 

teh between Sidney Ney and 

Rich, who ‘struggled to a 10- 

% draw; a spirited four round 
go between Manning Siegel and 

rt Litch; a spectacular. parallel 
bar exhibition by Harry Klotz and 
Abe Silver; and the windup, a six 
round exhibition between Young Sil- 
ver and Battling Barnett, well known 
Jewish professionals. This was Bar- 
nett’s first appearance in the ring. 


since he suffered a broken jaw in 


an Auditorium bout and he took keen 
delight. in showing the audience he 
could take punches on that selfsame 
jaw. He took a lot of them. 

Silver is developing into a splendid 
straight puncher with a remarkably 
snaky left hand and in the final round 
he and his veteran opponent took off 
the wraps and went to it to the huge 
delight of the crowd. 


After the boxing, there was an in- 
) 


formal dance.

“The past year was unusually gue- 
eessful,” stated Mr. Black, “and we

i expand our farm loan department, 
and in addition to develop a city loan

DRL. M. HUFF LEAVES 


FOR GAS RATE. CASE 


Dr. L. N. Huff, chairman of a cit- 
izens’ committee seeking reduced gas 
rates in Atlanta, left Atlanta Wed- 
nesday night for New Orleans, where 
he will atttend a hearing in the gas 
rate case to be held Friday before 


Judge Samuel Sibley and two other 
federal court judges. At the hearing 
the Georgia Railway and Power com- 
pany will urge a permanent injunc- 
tion restraining the state railroad 
commission from enforcing its recent 
order reducing gas rates in Atlanta 
from $1.65 to $1.55 net a thousand 
eubie feet. 

Chairman C. M. Candler, of the 
state railroad commission, and Judge 
J. J. Reagan, special counsel for 
the commission, will leave Atlanta 
Thursday night to represent the com- 
mission. 

Dr. Huff announced that he will go 
to New Orleans one day previous to 
the hearing in order to employ one 
of the ablest lawyers there to appear 
before the federal court to assist 
Chairman Candler and Judge Reagan 
in conducting the case. 

Before leaving Dr. Huff declared 
that the action of the gas company 
in “seeking to welch” in the fight 
waged before the state railroad com- 
mission is building up a strong sen- 
timent for — ownership of

“Every time the power company 
makes a move such as welching on

mission public sentiment for munici- 
pal ownership grows stronger. Just 
a few more such exhibitions and this 
issue will be brought to a climax,” 
he said. 

In his statement, Dr. Huff pointed 
out the success of municipal gas 
plants in other cities. 

“The city of Philadelphia owns its 
gas plant, leases it to an operating 
company which pays the municipality 
25 cents a thousand feet and charges 
its customers $1 a thousand cubic 
feet,” Dr. Huff said.

We. 0.P-LEADER 


Charges made by J. L. Phillips, 
chairman of the republican state cen- 
tral committee, that H. G. Hastings, 
prominent republican, of Atlanta, is 
seeking to dictate the appointment of 


a postmaster in Atlanta in the 2 
of his mail-order seed 

—.—ͤ—.— in a statement canal 
Wednesday by Mr. Hastings as a “re- 
flection on the whole depart- 
ment, from Will Hays down to the 
humblest employee.” 

Mr. Phillips issued a statement 
which appeared in The Constitution 
Wednesday morning, in which he dis- 
cussed certain activities of republicans 
in Georgia. In this statement he men- 
tioned Mr. Hastings as being ＋ 
interested in the appointment 
postmaster in Atlanta, and called at- 
tention to the fact that Mr. Hastin 
was one of the largest customers of the 
Atlanta postoffice. 

Most of Phillips’ tirade is too silly 
to comment on,” Mr. Hastings said. 


Mr. Hastings’ Statement 


Folowing is his statement in full: 

“I note Mr. J. L. Phillips’ tirade in 
this morning’s Constitution. Most of 
it js too silly to comment on. 

“The inference to be drawn from 
his remarks as to the  postoffice 
situation in Atlanta and in Georgia 
requires comment, however. The 
veiled charged is that if I should 
have any say 80 as to the Atlanta 
postoffice or Georgia postoffices 
that there would be crookedness in 
favor of my personal business On 
the part of the various and sundry 
postmasters and postal officials. I 
plead guilty to two charges. One is 
that my firm is the largest patron 
or customer of the Atlanta postof- 
fice, and the other that I am in- 


rules and regulations in favor of in- 


tensely interested in having a post- 


thmation tha ee are sus- 
ceptible and in Gus way of another 
can be ind 


to viola 


dividu and firms. 

“There is only one thing I ask or 
can ask of the Atlanta office and 
that is postal service of the best 
character. It's exactly what every 
other man dusiness wants and 
is entitled to have and it is the one 
—— they ty not t it Mr. Phil- 

lips succeeds in putting over an ap- 
pointment for this office he is re- 
ported as desiring. 

Entitled te Service. 

“The Atlanta postoffice is a big 
business institution. This city is en- 
titled to good postal service. My 
business is entitled to it. It is but 
natural that I should favor for this 
office a man who has had practic- 
ally a lifetime’s experience in the 
postal service, most of the time in 
an executive position, as against 
political hacks, inexperienced or in- 
con etent men. 

very postmaster in Atlanta for 
the past twenty-two years will tes- 
tify to the fact that G. Hastings 
or the H Hastings company has 
never asked a favor or any accom- 
modations not provided for by the 
postal laws and regulations. Fur- 
ther, they will testify that my firm 
has co-operated with the Atlanta of- 
fice in every 2 way to ex- 
pedite the handling of outgoing mail 
originatin with this rirm. 

“Certainiy, I have an intense de- 
sire to see the Atlanta postoffice in 
the hands of an experienced stal 
service man instead of in the hands 
of some of the incompetent and uu- 
fit men that Mr. Phillips is training 
— ape to whom he is under ob- 
gati 

“Personally I think the postal 
service is manned by men of the 
best type. They are hard workers, 
honest and generally efficient. The 
standards of the service must be 
maintained and it can only be main- 
tained by the appointment of ex- 
perienced, capable men.

Rheumatism is easier to avoid than 
to cure, states a well-known authori- 
ty. Weare advised to dress warmly; 
keep the feet dry; avoid exposure; 
— meat, but drink plenty of good 
water. 

Rheumatism is a direct result of 
lating through the system, eventually 
foods that produce uric acid which is 
absorbed into the blood. It is the 
function of the kidneys to filter this 
acid from the blood — east it out in 
the urine; the — of the skin are 
also a means of freeing the blood of 
this impurity. In damp and chilly 
cold weather the skin pores are closed 
thus forcing the kidneys to do double 
work, they become weak and sluggish 
and fail to eliminate the urie acid 
which keeps accumulating and circu- 
lating through the system, eventually 
settling in the joints and muscles 
causing stiffness, soreness and pain 
called rheumatism. 

At the first twinge of rheumatism 
get from any pharmacy. about four 
ounces of Jad Salts; put a yrs ng 


: ful in a glass of water and drin 


fore breakfast each morning for a 
week. This is said to eliminate uric 
acid by stimulating the kidneys to 
normal action, thus ridding the blood 
of these impurities. 

Jad Salts is inexpensive, harmless 
and is made from the acid of gta 
and lemon juice, combined with lithia 
and is used with excellent results by 
thousands of folks who are subject 
to rheumatism. Here you have a 
pleasant, effervescent lithia-water 
drink which helps overcome uric ae 
and is beneficial to your kidneys as 
well,— (adv. )

little dash of pep and an abundance 


of wholesome humor, the manage- 
ment of Keiths Lyric have actually

tion for the headliner is a team of 
international reputation, the Caits 
Brothers, those tailor made boys. 
When these boys were in London

Electrical Appliances, 
If Properly Maintained, 
Declared Not Dangerous 


Following the tragic death of Rem- 
sen King, prominent young Atlanta 
business man, at his home Tuesday 
night as the result, it is said, of 
coming into contact with an exposed 
wire of an electrical appliance, con- 
siderable interest was centered here 
Wednesday in the question of whether 
they are dangerous to have in use 
about the home. 

Following receipt of numerous in- 
quiries along this line, The Consti- 
tution referred the matter to officials 
of the Georgia Railway and Power 
company, who stated that practically 
no danger is incurred. in the use of 
an electric appliance which is prop- 
erly maintained. 

These appliances get their current 
from wires which supply light in 
homes, these wires carrying a voltage 
of 110. Physicians who have studied 
the matter say that 110 volts is not 
sufficient power to cause death in 
the average normal person under 
normal circumstances. In some cases, 
however, it is said, 100 volts or less 
can cause death. 

Reports of Mr. King’s death state 
that he was in the bathroom at the 
time of the electrocution, and officals 
point out that his hands may have 
: wet, thus intensifying the force 
0 

that the reports 


he current. 
They also said 

stated that Mr. King touched an ex- 
nosed wire. Evidence of the asser- 
tion that electrical appliances prop- 
erly maintained are not dangerous was 
drawn from the fact that this is the 
first time on record that such an ap- 
pliance has caused the death of any 
person in or near Atlanta. 


GOVERNOR URGES 
TAX SYSTEM 
REFORMATION 


Columbia, 8. C., January 11.— 
Reformation of a tax system that is 
out of date, was urged on the South 
Carolina legislature in strong language 
today by Governor Cooper, who 
delivered in person his annual mes- 
sage, challenging the state solons to 
the task of reducing the tax burden 
in the state without crippling the 
state government. 

The governor urged the enactment 
of a gasoline tax of one or two cents 
a gallon; a state income tax; an in- 
heritance tax; an occupation and busi- 
ness privilege tax; a tax on luxuries 
and a tax on hydro-electric power. 
He also u a constitutional amend- 
ment to allow the state to classify 
property for axation and pleaded for 
a continued interest in education.

(Special.)—To make a dairy a part of

as is a drive that already is well 
under way and bids fair to be a well 
established and paying industry of the 
county. 

A committee has visited the cream- 
ery An Moultrie and obtained details 
of the schedule prices and means of 
transportation of cream, and Thomas 
county may work with the creamery 
in that city. 

A meeting of all interested in this 
matter is called for Saturday, when 
reports will be heard from the com- 
mittee and all details in regard to this 
industry discussed. 


NEGRO LYNCHED; 
INSULTED WOMAN, 
SHERIFF ASSERTS 


Eufaula, Ala., January 11.—Willie 
Jenkins, a young negro, was shot to 
death near Batesville last night when 
he made a dash for freedom after 
being arrested on a charge of insult- 
ing a woman, according to the sheriff 
of Barbour county. 

The body had not been recovered, 
the -sheriff said. Persons who saw 
the body described it as being “riddled 
with bullets,” according to the officer’s 
statement, and when last seen two 
men on horseback were carrying it 
toward the Chattahoochee river.

Enthuses Large Audience 


Pianist 


One of the largest audiences of the 
season heard Sergei Rachmaninoff in 
recital at the Auditorium last night, 
and he stirred his hearers to an en- 
thusiasm scarcely less than that which 
greeted his former visit two years ago, 
although his program on the former 
occasion was more interesting. Dur- 
ing that two years he has proven 
that the artificial sensationalism sur- 
rounding the refugee artist from cha- 
otic Russia had little to do with the 
great hold he took immediately upon 

2 of America, for after be- 
ing three years a resident of this coun- 
try he still holds his own against many 
sensational newcomers. 

The bulk of his performance last 
night made it easy to see why, al- 
though one wondered at first his rea- 
son for playing the Weber-Tausig 
“Invitation to the Dance,’ outworn 
as it is by custom and style, while 
the Sonata Pathetique of Beethoven, 
which opened his program, somehow, 
did not strike fire. 

When he reached the Weber “Invi- 
tation.” however, with its elaborate 
furbishing up at the hands of Tausig, 
he so imbued it with new life and 
brilliance that some of his hearers 
were almost reconciled to his not 
playing something else instead, while 
others gave it a rousing reception that 
brought the first encore. 


unusual thing in this artist, who can 
couch his appeal in nobler terms, and 
still draw his response. 

His Chopin group was an instance, 
the ballad graduating from poignancy - 
into a concentrated intensity of pow- 
er that was in truth a tour de force, 
while the nocturnal was colored by a 
lofty and lovely sentiment worthy of 
Rachmaninoff. : 

His own prelude in C minor, which 
he has had to play so many times 
that he must sometimes wish he had 
never written it, with a polka of his 
own, an etude by Ernest ye, 
which was a fiery episode in a pro- 
gram. featured by brilliance and a 
tarantella on Italian themes by Liszt 
completed his program, barring the 
many encores his hearers demanded 
from the house, and then went some 
of them behind the scenes to perguade 
him to come once again and to play 
the prelude which was on his pro- 
gram here two years ago. 

A great pianist, one whose tech- 
nique measures with that of the most 
celebrated “wizards of the keyboard“ 
—and a great artist, broad in his con- 
ceptions, sane, but not too sane, he 
has that rare combination—the ap- 
peal to the erudite with his erudi- 
tion and a lofty congeniality with the 
spirit of the masters in music—and to 
the popular fancy with an undis-

JURY ELIMINATED 
SUICIDE THEORY 


Continued from First Page. 


one of the assignments given me 
Tuesday and I attended the meeting. 

During the course of the meeting 1 
obtained two “stories,’”’ one being in 
connection with Judge John D. Hum- 
phries’ speech on crime conditions he 
has observed in his court, and the 
other a facetious article on resolu- 
tions passed by the club in defense of 
“Uncle Bim“ Gump, a cartoon char- 
acter. On these stories I wrote - down 
short notes for my information when 
I returned to the office of The Con- 
stitution several hours later to write 
the stories. | 

When Mr. Foreman and Mr. Mor- 
gan made their talks on Mr. Compton 
it was explained by Mr. Foreman that 
he did not want the club to take any 
official action on the matter and I 
judged from the tone of his talk and 
that of Mr. Morgan that neither 
speech was intended for publication, 
both being delivered at a semi-private 
luncheon. For this reason I took no 
notes. of the speeches. 

Has Published Story. 

After leaving the Rotary club I 
covered other assignments including 
my regular run of the state capitol 
and returned to the office of The 
Constitution about 5 o’clock. At the 
office I found the usual batch of clip- 
pings from the afternoon papers given 
for consideration in reporting assign- 
ments. To my surprise I found that 
one of the afternoon papers had pwint- 
ed an article about the speeches or 
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Foreman. 

In the report in the afternoon paper 
I observed that the speeches of both 
Mr. Foreman and Mr. Morgan were 
given at some length. The afternoon 
paper article was “re-witten” for The 
Corstitution and The Constitution did 
not print anything of any kind that 
was not the afternoon paper’s articie. 
In fact the afternoon paper on the fol- 
lowing day, Wednesday, again ran 
the same story it printed in its “pink” 
edition on the afternoon before. 

The Constitution could have had 
no motive in the matter as everything 
that appeared in The Constitution ar- 
ticle previously had appeared in the 
„pink edition” of the afternoon paper. 
No ulterior motive can be assigned to 
me in the matter as I do fiot know 
either Mr. Foreman or Mr. Morgan 
personally. I do know many officers 
and members of the Rotary club and 
also of the police department and my 
relations with both always have been 


cordial and pleasant. 
Story in Afternoon Paper. 

Following is the story apfearing in 

the afternoon paper and which was 
re-written for The Constitution of 
Wednesday morning: 
Charges that the Atlanta police depart- 
ment is endeavoring to ‘shirk its responsibil- 
ity’ in solving the mystery surrounding 
the death of Mr. J. Russell Compton, were 
made at Tuesday’s meeting of the Atlanta 
Rotary club. Mr. Compton was a Rotarian, 
and his fellow members immediately 
after the tragedy offered a reward of $1,000 
for the capture of his slayer. 

Lauren Foreman and Brooks Morgan, 
prominent members of the Rotary club, de- 
livered the attack on the police department, 
but at their uest no resolutions were 
offered and no official action taken by the 
club, Both speakers charged that the po- 
lice were endeavoring to popularize the 
theory that Mr. Compton committed suici:le 
in order to cloak their own inefficiency 
that the police preferred to leave a stain 
on Mr. Compton’s memory rather than to 
admit their inability to solve the mystery 
surrounding his death. ’ 

Mr. Foreman made it plain that ne 
did not want the Rotary club to tuke 
— official action toward branding the sui- 
cide theory as false, but asked hat each 
member, individually, brand the theory as 
false, whenever he heard it discussed. Pro- 
longed applause fr the two hundred odd 
members present at the luncheon greeted Mr. 
Foreman’s remarks. 

„He attacked the suicide theory advanced 
by the detective department as ‘propaganda, 
pure and simple,’ and declared that Mr. 
Compton had no possible motive for wishing 
to dle. Mr. Foreman said that he had 
long known Mr. Compton intimately both in 
a social 1 a business way, and that he 
was one the happiest men he knew. 
His financial affairs were in excellent shape, 
said Mr, Foreman, 1 

“Mr. Morgan, president of the Frank 
E. Block company, and another intimate 
business and personal friend of Mr. Compton, 
also attacked the sulcide theory, declaring 
that ‘it is time for the people to come 
forward and brand for what it is, the in- 
efficiency of the police and detective de- 
part ments.“ 

„Mr. Morgan spoke feelingly of the life 
of Mr. Compton, and said that of all the 
men he knew, Russell Compton was the 
last man who would ever commit suicide. 
His family and friends bitterly resent the 
fforts to establish the suicide theory, Mr. 

organ declared. 

The Atlanta Rotary club stood in silent 
tribute for two minutes in memory of Mr. 
Compton, and Dr, M. Ashby Jones offered 
prayer.“ 

Mr. Morgan’s Statement. 

The statement issued by Mr. Morgan Wed- 
nesday was as follows: 

I made no attack on the police depart- 
ment and said not one word contained in 
the following extract from The Constitu- 
tion of Wednesday morning: 

The last vestige of doubt that gross u- 
efficiency exists in the police department 
has disappeared,’’ he declared. It is high 
time for the public to arise and demand its 


es they are. 
The following is an accurate and com- 
plete account of my remarks: 


| more than 200 women. It has been my 
pleasure on many occasions to come in con- 
tact with Russell Compton in the discus- 
sion of employment matters. I always 
found him most considerate of their em- 
ployees and in fact I believe that he was the 
most considerate employer of female labor 
in the city, and an investigation will show 
that his company paid the highest wages 
of any in the city of Atlanta. 

„In our meetings Mr. Compton was al- 
ways the champion of the employees and 
took the part of the worker, and in his loss 
labor has lost one of its best and most 
courageous friends. 

“The last time that I was in conference 
with Russell Compton on the subject of the 
present depressed conditions and labor cost 
he said: The cost of living and rent has 
not yet reached the point where labor can 
stand much of a reduction in wages and 
that so far as he was concerned he was 
going to agitate the highest possible. wage, 
so long as hig company could keep from 
losing money.’ He spoke of his own hard 
years of work and his struggles to sup- 

rt his mother. e 

„Russell Compton seemed to take great 
pleasure in his work and was always in a 
very happy frame of mind. 

‘There is not a man in this room, in my 
opinion, that had so little reason to take his 
own life and I think it a shame that any 
effort should be made to place upon that 
courageous boy the stigma of a coward, 
such as a suicide is generally reputed to be. 

„It would appear from what Mr. Fore- 
man has said and from the newspaper re- 
potts, that the detective department is ad- 
vancing this theory to cover their own inef- 
ficiency. 

„1 think we should do everything pos- 
sible, to stop the effort to fasten the -sui- 
cide verdict upon him and I think that 
if the efforts to do so are continued, that 
every member of this club should rise in 
resentment and protect the good name of one 
of our departed members.“ 


Chief Poole Replies. 


Chief of Detectives Lamar Poole 
Wednesday issued a statement in 
which he replied to criticism of his de- 
partment voiced at the Rotary club 
luncheon ‘Tuesday. 

„It has been the history of the police 
department that public meetings could 
be arranged to criticize the depart- 
ment but never to assist it,” Chief 
Poole said. “We will welcome the as- 
sistance of the Rotary club in the 
Compton case and will welcome any 
experts the club will assign in the 


ase. 

Chief Poole said he was glad that 
friends of Mr. Compton had “at last 
become willing to say something,” and 


from these friends something may be 
accomplished in . discovering the 
slayer. 

Chief Poole said friends of Mr. 
Compton had handicapped the search 
for the slayer by declining to give de- 
tectives information about his personal 
life, 


HUSBAND IS GUARD 
OF MRS. WILLIAMS

beau, attorney for Mrs. Williams, to 
accept the sentence of the court and 
not to ask a second trial, plans were 
made by authorities for her transfer 
to the state farm, and at 1 o'clock 
Wednesday afternoon she bade the 
prisoners and officials at the, tower 
fatewell, and, accompanied by Mr. 
Williams, went to their residence on 
Ormond street, where she attended 
to a few household affairs, 

They spent the next two hours in 
the retail district, buying various ar- 
ticles of comfort. 5 

At the Terminal station shortly 
before 4 o’clock Mr. Williams and his 
prisoner-wife were met by Attorney 
Guillebeau. After a short chat with 
him they boarded a Central of Geor- 
gia train for Macon. They expected 
to spend Wednesday night together 
in Macon, and proceed to Milledge- 
ville Thursday. 

The killing of N. L. Post, Atlanta 
locomotive engineer, in the bedroom 
of Mrs. Williams on Thanksgiving 
eve created a sensation. She sum- 
moned the police to her home and 
told them she had killed the engineer 
in self-defense. 

Auto Ride Party. i 

A party involving automobile rides 
and drinking had preceded the shoot- 
ing, it developed, and Post is said to 
have tried to attack her after they 
arrived at her home. 
| On Thursday, January 5, she was 
convicted of manslaughter and given 
a sentence of from one to five years. 

During her stay at the ‘Tower she 
became very popular with the prison- 
ers. Since the trial she has been very 
cheerful, and while in company with 
her husband Wednesday seemed to be 
happy. She ran across a large num- 
ber of acquaintances while on the 
streets and seemed glad of the oppor- 
tunity of chatting with them before 
leaving. 


ALLEGED NARCOTIC 
VIOLATOR ARRESTED 


James Craig, a former resident of 
Atlanta, who is sought by federal nar- 
cotie officers for alleged violation of 
the Harrison narcotic act, was ar- 
rested Wednesday in Memphis, Tenn., 
according to Inspector Nations, Wed- 
nesday. Inspector Nations stated that 
Craig had been pursued from here to 
Birmingham and then to Chattanooga, 
and from thence to Memphis. “They 
will have to go farther away than 
that if they expect to get by with 
it,” said Inspector Nations.

"HIGHWAY AT 


Washington, January 11.—Secretary 
of Agriculture Wallace is considering 
a tentative draft of rules and regula- 
tions for aflministration of the federal 
highway act, under which $75,000,000 
is made available for construction of 
federal aid roads, it was announced 
today. In formulating these funda- 
mental rules, it was said, the depart- 
ment is consiiiting the state highway 
officials, who will have much to do 
with carrying out the purposes of the 
act, as represented by the executive 
committee of the American Association 
of State Highway Officials. 

Each state highway ee Oe 
cording to the UT ge ert has n 
requested to submit to thé department 
a tentative map showing routes pro- 
posed for primary and secondary sys- 
tems of roads to be constructed under 
the act. In considering these recom- 
mendations, it was said, special at- 
tention will be given to social and 
economic questions involved. 


Girl Rouges Lips 
With Poison But 


Didn’t Swallowlt 


Miss Thelma Williams, pretty 17- 
year-old girl, of 205 South Forsyth 
street, caused great excitement Tues- 
day afternoon when she promenaded 
in the rear of her home with scant 
clothing} with her stockings rolled be- 
low her knees, and gave loud screams, 
which attracted the neighbors, ac- 
cording to the police. She had been 
seen to take some potassium per- 
manganatef it is said, and had inti- 
mated that she had had trouble with 
her sweetheart. 

Grady hospital sent an ambulance 
immediately to the scene and the girl 
refused to go to the hospital, claiming 
that she had only rubbed the perman- 
ganate on her lips as a stall. 

However, the Grady employees took 
her anyway and applie remedies at 
the hospital, rubbed the poison off 
her lips, and learning that she had 
not taken the substance internally, 
they returned her to her home. 


Colder Weather 
Predicted Today 
By Weather Man 


- 


Peachtree. street. was studded late 
Wednesday night with figures heavily 
clad in overcoats, capes and various 
articles of apparel that the human 
species is wont to wear to shield itself 
from the cold, in spite of the general 
impression that the cold spell was at 
an end. 

Clear and colder was the thougt.t of 


every Atlantan who hurried along 


with the high wind striking his face. 
but the change was not a bad one, 
from the copious rains of the day be- 
fore. Those who had survived the 
downpour of Tuesday which brought 
vague, haunting thoughts of pneumo- 
nia and the flu, were not unpleasuntly 
impressed with the wather experienced 
on January 10. 

On the strength of the touch of cold 
weather several hundred Atlantans 
dragged forth the family woollens from 
eir moth-ridden hiding places. Weod 
alcohol was on sale, plainly labeled, 
to prevent mistake, but no federal offi- 
cer would object, as he would proba- 
bly use a considerable quantity him- 
self—in his radiator. . 

According to C. F. von Herrmann. 
local weather forecaster, the cold will 
be more pronounced, with a drop of 
about 10 degrees in the temperature 
Thursday. 

In the morning the thermometer 
will range around 32 degrees, but will 
rise gradually until noon, it is re- 
ported. Winds, which blew at a high 
rate of speed Wednesday, will die 
down about 3 o'clock in the evening. 


COST OF IGNORANCE 
STRESSED IN, TALK 
BY WILLIS SUTTON 


BY ABE NISSENBAUM. : 
Willis A. Sutton, superintendent of 


the Atlanta public schools, made a 
speech to the entire student body of the 
Boys’ High school Wednesday morn- 
ing in\the school auditorium, on the 
subject, “The Cost of Ignorance.” 

Mr. Sutton mentioned the fact that 
while Georgia farmers were selling 
cotton for 20 cents per pound, that 
very same cotton, when sent off and 
made into cloth, was sold back to the 
people who produced it at an immense 
profit. Mr. Sutton attributed this 
condition to the fact that the people 
were ignorant. 

The superintendent said that one 
north Georgia town is shipping red 
clay to a small town in Ohio for $17.50 
per carload, thus enabling that town to 
make enough money out of Georgia 
clay per year to pay one-half of the 
expenses of this state. 

r. Sutton said that one time Adam 
and Eve were sitting under a fig tree 
discussing timely topics and, upon see- 
ing the lightning flash, Eve exclaimed: 
“Isn’t that perfectly beautiful?” and 
just about that time the lightning 
struck a big tree and split it wide 
open and Adam said: Les, but ain't 
it dangerous!” Mr. Sutton brought 
out the point in this by sayin at 
the lightning was present in 2 
day. as well as it was in the days of 
Franklin, but on account of ignorance, 
the world had to suffer heavy proper- 
ty losses about six thousand years. 

The leqture which Mr .Sutton gave 
is only one of the many that he is 
going to deliver in the city during the 
next few months in his campaign 
agai illiteracy. 


LITIGATION ON SONGS 
SETTLED OUT OF COURT 


. I. Cooledge, one of the pro- 
prietors of James cafe, 37 North Pry- 
or street, recently sued in federal 
court by the James H. Remick com- 
pany, musical publishers of New York, 
for infringement of copyright laws, 
Wednesday stated that the litigation 
has been settled out of court. 

It was charged that the cafe or- 
c gave a public performance in 
which two songs copyrighted by the 
Remick company were used without 
permission. Mr. Cooledge announced 
that he has obtained permission of 
the publishers to use the songs and 
8 will be played regularly at

ON MANY CHARGES} 


Athens, Ga., January 11.—(Spe- 
cial: Thornton, who is being 
held in Lexington on two state war- 
rants him with kidnaping 
and a stautory offence in connection 

Evie Holbert, of Athens, aged 
12 years, who disappeared with him 
December 15, and who was found with 
him in Aiken, & C., soon will be 
given a preliminary hearing in the ted- 
eral court here before Judge Walter

cuit of Georgia federa! court. Thorn- 
ton is the husband of Evie Holbert's 
older sister. 

Federal. agents in Athens stated to 
reporters that when Thornton is 
brought to Athens from Lexinzton 
he will be heavily guarded, as there 
have been rumors of violence. It is 
said that on December 30 the train 
bringing him to Lexington from South 
Carolina was flagged and an unsuc- 
cessful attempt was made to remove 
him at that time.

THAT THE MOUTH AND 
TEETH REQUIRE MORE 
PERSONAL ATTENTION 


Fifty thousand American Dentists have 
organized to teach the general public the 
great importance of “MOUTH HYGIENE,” 
the good derived from this wonderful un- 
dertaking can not be estimated, many nil- 
lions of people will appreciate this teaching 
and devote a few moments a day to the 
care of their mouths and teeth, 

To greatly increase safety, and to more 
nearly perfect a treatment for “HOME 
USE” im the daily care of the mouth, 
PYRODINE, a preparation derived from 
the most reliable remedies used by the Den- 
tal profession, is being offered through the 
drug trade at a most nominal cost. PYRO- 
DINE is designed and manufactured by our 
own American dentists, men who have had 
many yenrs’ experience in the treatment of 
PYORRHEA and all other disorders of the 
mouth and teeth, these men we know, are 
familiar with the requirements of our 
mouths. PYRODINE is the most perfect 
cleansing agent that can be safely taken 
into the mouth, and is the most valuable 
re y known, for the relief and preven- 
tion of PYORRHEA, 

To serve those whose druggists will for a 
time be unable to ly, we will mail a 
dollar bottle, for an additional 10c for mail- 
ing. Pyrodine is recommen to you by 
dentists who know your needs.

Killing Girl’ 


Prominent Waycross M an 
Believed Mentally Unbal- 
anced When He Shot. 


Waycross, Ga., January 11.— (Spe- 
eial.) —J. Turner Sharpe, age 30, of 
this city, who, early this morning. 
shot and killed Miss Dorothy Parker, 
society girl, of Asheville, N. C.; and 
then turned the pistol on himself, is 
a member of a prominent family in 
this city. 

Sharpe has made his home here all 
his life, being prominent in business 
and fraternal circles. He was a Mason, 
a member of the local Shrine club, and 
an active member of B. P. O. E. 
lodge. During the late war, he 
served in the Y. M. C. A., and was a 
member »f the local Legion post. 

Many Friends. 

He has been in poor health for 
over a year, and had spent the great- 
er part of the past year in Asheville 
ir an effort to recover. He has been 


subject to spells of despondeney for 
-| some time and it is generally believed 


that he was mentally unbalanced when 
the tra Ay occurred in Asheville. 

The announcement of the tragedy 
shocked the entire community, and the 
news has cast a spell of gloom over 
bes many friends here.

MISS PARKER REFUSED 
TO MARRY SHARPE. 

Asheville, N. C., January 11.—Miss 
Dorothy Parker, 24, prominent society 


30, of Waycross, Ga., are dead as the 
result of bullets fired by Sharpe this 
morning, supposedly because Miss 
Parker would not marry him. 

The dual tragedy occurred as the 
two were walking in the city’s most 
fashionable residential section. Both 
died within a few minutes. Miss 
Parker, a French instructor in the 
Grove Park school, was en route to 
her work en the shooting occurred. 
Sharpe had been visiting the girl for 
about two years. 

The girl was a daughter of Dr. and 
Mrs. J. M. Parker, and was a graduate 
of the Saint Genevieve convent here. 
Last evening her parents entertained 
Sharpe at dinner and this morning he 
called to walk with her to school. The 
pair were laughing and talking, when 
seemingly without warning Sharpe 
drew an army revolver from within 
his coat, fired two shots into the girl’s 
right temple and then sent a bullet 
into his own head. 

Persons who rushed to their side 
found them dying. 


Mrs. Parker, brought to the scene by 
the police on the belief that she knew 
the victim, was prostrated upon per- 
ceiving that it was her own daughter. 
The bodies were removed to an un- 
dertaking establishment. Sharpe came 
here in search of health, being ill with 
pulmonary trouble. He was formerly 


in Waycross, Ga. , 
Miss Parker was popular in the 
younger set of the city. 


Harris Renews 


Fight for Ford 
Nitrate Offer 


Washington, January 11.—Renew- 
ing his charge that the “fertilizer 
trust” was seeking to defeat the Mus- 
cle Shoals development project, Sena- 


tor Harris, democrat, Georgia, called 
the attention today of the senate to 
a circular which he said had been 
sent out by the National Fertilizer 
Association of Philadelphia, and 
which was captioned “Cost of Taxpay- 
ers of Ford Muscle Shoals Offer.” 
“I simply wish to call this to the 
attention of the senate,” Senator Har- 
ris said, “to show that the fertilizer 
trust has been from the very beginning 


of the Muscle Shoals development try- |’ 


ing to defeat it in order that they 
may maintain high prices of fertilizer 
which. the farmers of the south and 
west ‘must pay. 

“The secretary of war is handling 
the matter för the government,” Sena- 
tor Harris added. “Every senator 
knows that he is one of the ablest 
business men who has occupied that 
position in a long time. He has the 
confidence of the senate, and we know 
that he is taking care of the govern- 
ment interests. But the National 
Fertilizer association does not think 
so, and they think we need help from 
them, and they send information to us 
about Muscle Shoals and close by say- 
ing: 

„The National Fertilizer associa- 
tion, at 1010 Arch street, Philadel- 
phia, Pa., will be glad to furnish you 
further information on this subject.“

“Of Forestry Bill 


* 
> 


— 


tee as a representative of the Ameri- 
can Newspaper Publishers’ associa- 
tion, 


Mr. Baker said he favored “every 
of the bill, which provides 
or co-operation by the federal gov- 
ernment with state owners of timber 
lands in the conservation of forests 
and development of new timber tracts. 
of the measure aiso advo- 
cated by W. L. Hall, representing the 
Union League of Chicago, who pre- 
sented resolutions for the club indors- 
ing the ball. 

Mr. Baker stated that of approxi- 
mately 7,000,000 tons of paper pro- 
duced annually in the United States 
about 2,100,000 tons was newsprint, 
An unfailing supply of paper is vi- 
tally necessary to newspapers, he de- 
clared, adding that publishers also 
realized the importance of fire prevén- 
tion as a means of safeguarding forest 


lan 

R. S. Kellogg, of New York, chair- 
man of the national forestry program 
committee, testified that while the pa- 
per industry was extending into the 
southern states through the develop- 
ment of new processes of making pa- 
per from weod hitherto ‘unavailable 
for this purpose, the mills making 
newsprint were dependent chiefly up- 
on the spruce found in northeastern 
states. 

George W. Sisson, Jr., of Potsdam, 
N. Y., representing the American Pa- 
per and Pulp association, emphasized 
the necessity of preserving forests of 
the United States and of developing 
new timber tracts. The development 
of the paper industry in the far west, 
with great stands of suitable timber, 
he said; is being retarded by the cost 
of railroad transportation across the 
country. 


KIRBY WARNS 
AGAINST FREE 
MATERIAL STAND 


Washington, January 11.—The re- 
publican party will make large gains 
in the south in the next congressional 
campaign unless the democrats aban- 
don the doctrine of free raw material 
as applied in tie Underwood tariff 
act, John H. Kirby, president of the 


today after adjournment of a two-day 
session here of that organization. 

“As the head of an organization 
that was formed as a protest against 
the pernicious doctrine of free raw 
materials,” said Mr. Kirby, “I feel 
commissioned to warn the democratic 
leaders and members of the senate 
that, unless they repudiate the tariff 
policy announced by Minority Leader 
Kitchin on the floor of the house, 
April 14, 1921, and aecepted by a 
large majority of the democratic mem- 
bers of the house, then the solid south 
will be broken.”
