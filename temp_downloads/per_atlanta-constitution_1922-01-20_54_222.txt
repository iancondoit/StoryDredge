Chicago, Januaty 19.—Reports that 
a large store had opened a window 
display in which living and unclad 
reproductions of Helen of Troy, Venu» 
and Cleopatra were the chief points 
of interest, atteatted such crowds 
that traffic was blocked. 

As the crowd became larger, a patrol 
wagon rolled up and a police sergeant 
and five aides rusned forward. 

Then the sergeant came out. 

“Come on, men, it’s all right,” he 
mumbled to his aides, who still were 
staring in the window. , “Those are 
just wax figures, but way back in 
the rear of the window that way, they 
sure did look real.” 

No more crowds formed, for the 
sergeant had ordered that even wax 
figures must be draped, and his orders 
were carried out promptly.

the careers of the pair, which prove 
that the boy brigand was not caught 
after taking his first false step and 
that the girl’s innocent prettiness con-

For instance, an investigation will 
prove, detectives assert, that DulPre 
was stealing as far back as last Au-

organized band of thieves, who had a

More than that, the detectives as- 
wrt that Betty and DuPre had an 
active part in the preparations for 
similar raids on the Loftis jewelry 
store, the store of the Sanford Jew- 
elry Co., and the department store 
of M. Rich & Bros. Co. 


They had visited all these stores, 
ohserved the plans, noted exits, and 
had gone so far even as to interview 
clerks or floorwalkers on store cus- 
tom and routine. 

According to newly elucidated in- 
formation, the band considered that 
if all these raids were successful, .it 
would be time to move on from At- 
Janta and had already determined on 
New Orleans as their next field for 
operations. 


Betty Denied Interview. 


Thursday afternoon Betty Andrews 
went to the Fulton tower. She asked 
to see DuPre, but officials, acting un- 
der rigid orders, were forced to deny 
her request. 

Turning away. she went back to 
her hotel. Late in the afternoon she 
was taken to the office of the solicitor 


.| by Detectives Fenn and Sturdivant, 


and thete grilled for almost two 
hours. 

Announcement that the state will 
not be ready for prosecution of DuPre 
until Tuesday, when he will be placed 
on trial for murder of Pinkerton De- 
tective Irby C. Walker on December 
was made from the solicitor’s of- 
ice. 

When announcement of the state’s 
plan to commence the trial Tuesday 
ecme, Attorneys H. A. Allen and 
Louis Foster, who have been retained 
ns counsel for DuPre. stated to Du- 
Pre and his father at the Fulton Tow- 
er that they will not be ready on 
that date, a-" said they will ask for 
additional ti:ue Jn which to prepare 
their defense. . ! 

Attorney Allen intimated that the 
alleged insanity of his client will not 
he stressed, although it may be intro- 
duced as an extenuating circumstance. 
The primé factors entering in their 
defense and those with which it is 
honed DuPre may be saved from the 
gallows, are his extreme youth, his 
association with criminals and his 
Jack of will power to resist alcoholic 
drinka,-. 

__DuPre’s confession that he was 
“blind drunk” when he committed the 
fleed may also. bé used:as a votential 
factor.. DuPre’s attorneys said. - 

Slut Off From World. 


DuPre, in his guarded cell at the 
Tower, has been rendered practically 
incommunicado., During ‘Thursday 
several relatives from‘ South Carolina, 
A minister, and an old friend of the 
Tt were refused admission to see 

im. 

Attempts to secure from Chief of 
Detectives Poole the names of the two 
Atlanta pawnbrokers. alleged members 
of the organized: syndicate of diamond 
thieves, whose organization was. said 
to have been revealed in DuPre’s con- 
fession, resulted in failure. Neither 
could. their identity be learned from 
other sources. It is believed that the 
additional indictments to be returned 
Friday by the grand jury will contain 
the names of these two men. 
Intimations were made public in po- 
lice circles that the two pawnhrokers 
are well known locally ond that a sen- 
sation will be created when their iden- 
tity is divulged. 

It was rumored Thursday that 
among the list of indictments by the 
grand jury will be changes of the 
charge against some of the men already 
indicted or actually under arrest, and 
that charges at present resting against 
them charging them as being accesso- 
ries after the fact will be changed to 
accessories before the fact. 

According to Chief Poole, the ac- 
complices named in DuPre’s confes- 
sion are ©. R. Buckley, taxicab driver, 
who carried DuPre to Chattanooga the 
night of the tragedy: Jack J. Worth, 
alleged to have had knowledge of the 
deed both prior to and after the rob- 
bery and killing; C. A. Wiley, broker, 
who is charged with having aided Du- 
Pre in disposing of rings stolen from 
Davis & Freeman Jewelry company 
before the Nat Kaiser store robbery, 
and Betty Andrews, DuPre’s sweet- 
heart, who is alleged to have had 
knowledge both prior to and after Du- 
Pre’s crimes. 

Geoghan’s Connection. 

Vincent Geoghan and the two pawn- 
brokers were not discussed by the chief 
and just what their alleged connection 
in the case is at present is entirel 

roblematical. It was not deni , 

owever, that Geoghan was the re- 
cipient of the letter from DuPre, and 
acted upon instructions that it be sent 
to The Constitution.

Declarations that the interstate and 
intrastate rate structure in the south 
is not what it. ought to be; that rate 
difficulties throughout the courtry 
are becoming more numerous cach 
year; that the existing railroad situa- 
tion throughout the country is bad, 
but that “lL am di to be opti- 
misti¢ aboutt®ir future in this coun- 
try,” were made Thursday night by 
Joseph B. Eastman, member of. the 
interstate commerce commission, at 


‘the annual banquet of the Atlanta 


Freight bureau in the Piedmont hotel, 

Mr. Eastman stated that he is in 
the south to make specific revcommen- 
dations to the interstate commerce 


commission as to the amount of time | 99 


and work necessary for the commis- 


sion to investigate thoroughly the con- ' 


ditions of interstate rates in the south, 

intrastate rates. “I 
have differed with members of the 
il. ©. C..” be said, “on the commis- 
sion’s authority and power over intra- 
state rates; but there was full agree- 
ment. between all when I suggested 
that 1 investigate rates in the south. 

Will Urge Investigation. 

“In bave found that the rate struc- 
ture in the south is not what it ought 
to be, that interstate rates are not on 
a balance with intrastate rates, that 
the latter conflict with themselves. I 
will recommend to the commission 
that an investigation be ordered inutc 


_¢lass rates applicable to, from and 


within southern territory. I do not 
know whether or not the investigation 
will be ordered; the commission will 
decide that. 

“The settlement of rates is a diffi- 
cult matter. It seems that the diffi- 
culties are increasing in ratio with 
each year as it comes and goes. Last 
year the commission was presented 
with 1,200 formal rate cases; 900 
formal finance matters; 70,000 infor- 
mal complaints, and 240,000 letters 
were received. The commission dur- 
ing 1921 had 1,700 employees, 500 of 
whom were valuation workers. 

“We need constructive relief to do 
away with complaints. It will be 
necessary to go to the roots of the 
question, and I hope the commission 
will do so. 

“The existing railroad situation is 
very bad throughout the United 
States; shippers and carriers are both 
complaining; we are trying to settle 
the question in a manner agreeable to 
both. But as for the future of the 
railroads, I am disposed to be opti- 
mistic. Prejudice is a cause of much 
of present and past complaints. I 
hope some day people will look at dif- 
ficulties and questions from a scien- 


_ tific and not prejudiced viewpoint. 


~“There are some things which 
should be known and (followed. 
First, that the railroads are primarily 
public serving ; second, that a railroad 
must have an operative capital in 
order to be efficiently operative; 
third, that a railroad, in order to be 
efficient, should have good and co- 
operative employees; and fourth, that 

e various railroads of the country 
should co-operate more. If such 
things were acknowledged and follow- 
ed, things would get all right. 

“As to the transportation. act of 
1920, I think history will say that it 
showed that the railroads, though mu- 
tially ing Jere natigpally de- 
pendent; that se-mre in ted in 
fostering weak Toads, as well as in 
curbing big roads, and that co-opera- 
tion between the ‘railroads and be- 
tween them and the people is neces- 
sary for a healthful condition of 
things.” 

Perry Praises Eastman. 

Mr. Eastman was introduced before 
his address by James A. Perry, of 
the Georgia commission, whe described 
him as “a man not only of efficiency 
but of the courage of his convictions.’ 
Mr. Perry spoke of Atlanta as the 
greatest city in the greatest state in 
the south. 

Approximately 300 Atlantans, lead- 
ers in civic, political, industrial and 
commercial life, were present at the 
meeting, which was declared by offi- 
cials of the bureau as the largest and 
best in its history. Ralph Rosenbaum, 
chairman of the 1921 board of diree 
tors, presided. 

Other speakers at the meeting were 
J. T. Boifeuillet, of the. Georgia rail- 
road commission; Councilman Edgar 
Watkins, Walker T. Lee, secretary to 
Mayor Key, who was unable to at- 
tend, and H. E. Choate, past chair- 
man of the bureau’s board of directors. 
Chairman Rosenbaum made his annual 


um, ase . - n, 
lingham, George ee Jr., 
ex-officio members, E. Choate, 
Bolling H. Jones and W. A. Parker. 

VR A Successful Year. 

Chairman Rosenbaum in his report 
said that 1921 was the most success- 
ful year in the history of the organi- 
zation, and predicted that 1922 will 
be even more successful. He said 
that the organization was formed some 
20 years ago, with less than 40 mem- 
bers, and that it now has a member- 
ship of more than In speaking 
of the. work of the bureau, he said 
that during 1921 it andited 84,025 
freizht bills; filed $16,801.85 .in over- 
eharge claims; adjudicated $25,850.97 
in loss and damage claims; quoted 
19,472 rates by telephone; quoted 
; tes by letter, making the 
total of quotations 42,226. He also 
praised the work of Harry T. Moore, 
secretary and traffic manager, and 
the work of the board of directors. 

Mr. Moore in his report discussed 
the work of the bureau during 1921 
in rate casegp and the fight it has suc- 
cessfully mdde in securing rate redue- 
tions. He also read a summary of 
the recent tentative order by the Geor- 
gia commission on class rates, to be 
found in another part of The Con- 
stitution, 

Following Mr. Choate’s, speech, 
which was an eulogy on the late Wil- 
liam A. Wimbish, general counselor 
for the bureau, the members drank a 
silent toast to his memory. Council- 
man Edgar Watkins in accepting the 
position of general counselor, and 
Commissioner Eastman also praised 
the worth and character of the late 
Mr. Wimbieh. 

Walker, Lee, secretary to Mayor 
Key. as 4 representative of the city 
of Atlanta, said that “we have had 
the unstinted co-operation of the bu- 
reau ever since the mayor took office: 
we fee] that there is no other civic 
or commercial organization in Atlanta 
that deserves more credit than the 
bureau.” He also praised the work 
of Harry T. Moore, secretary of the 
bureau, as did State Commissioner 
Perry in his speech. 

Among the guests at the, banquet 
were W. V. Hardie, chief of the traf* 
fic department of the J. C. C., and 
the southern state commissioners who 
have been in conference here. 


TO ASK REDUCTION 
IN FREIGHT RATES 


Continued from. First Page. 


conferred with and addressed the con- 
ference. 

Following an exchange of opinion 
with state commissioners, Mr. East- 
man said that he would recommend 
tov the interstate commerce commission 
that an investigation be ordered into 
clase rates applicable to, from, and 
within southern territory and that, in 
his opinion, it seems desirable for all 
commissions in southern territory to 
act at. once as the Georgia commis- 
sion has done in planning such re- 
vision of intrastate rates as may be 
deemed proper. looking to harmony 


}and making uniform intrastate and in- 


terstate rates. | 

It. was the opinion of commission- 
ers at Thursday’s meeting that the 
recent tentative order--by the Geor- 
gia commission on class rat@ is a 
ecnstructive piece ‘of work tiit de- 
serves highest commendation ‘and, it 
was the opinion of some comfiission- 
ers, that other southern states would 
very likely adopt the proposed. scale 
of Georgia rates. 


Will*Inerease Traffic. 


During the discussion of the motion 
to name a committee to appear before 
the. interstate commerce commission 
and ask for a reduction in all inter- 
state rates, M. C. Moore, rate ex- 
pert of the Mississippi commission, de- 
clared that the canners would profit 
as a result of rate reduction. “Such 
reduction,” he said, “will cause an 
imménse increase in traffic, because 
present rates are prohibitory to qhou- 
sands of shippers who are not shipping 
their produce and goods although they 
would if rates were lower. If the 
interstate commerce commission were 
to reduce rates, then traffic would 
so increase that the roads would re- 
ceive more revenue than they do 
now.” 

Before the passage of the resolution 
creating the committee, J> H. Tench, 
rate expert of the Florida commis- 
sion, said that the committee repre- 
sentation before the interstate com-

Before adjournment, Commissioner 
Tench moved the adoption of a reso- 
lution exp g appreciation shown 
the commissi@ners while in Atlanta. 
It was adopt 


ing place, because of its central loca- 
tion. Chairman Perry and the other 
state commissioners expressed delight 
over the meeting and its results. 

Others at the meeting were J. 7. 
Boifeuillet, of the Georgia railroad 
commission; E. M. Price, rate expert 
of the Georgia. commission; B. H. 
Cooper, commissioner of Alabama; 
Commissioner Lee and W. G. Womble, 
rate expert of the North Carolina com- 
mission. 

Reference has been made to the 
recent tentative order by the Geor- 
gia commission on class rates.. The 
commissioners at Thursday’s confer- 
ence spoke of it as a constructive 
piece of work that. deserves highest 
commendation, and Interstate Com- 
merce Commissioner Eastman advised 
other southern states to act at once 
as the Georgia commission has done in 
planning such revision of intrastate 
rates. The outstanding features of 
that tentative order, docket 15416, 
decided January 17, 1922, were sum- 
marized in the annual teport of Harry 
T. Moore, secretary of the Atlanta 
Freight bureau, at the bureau’s an- 
nual banquet Thursday night, the 
story of which is carried elsewhere: 


Tentative Order. 


The features of the tentative order 
are: 

1. A.revision of the present road classi- 
fication was considered, and. the commis- 
sion decided that the time had come when 
the railroads of the state, in so far as 
freight tariffs are concerned, should be 
divided into two classes only, to be desig- 
natedSas freight class A and B. 

2. The commission condemned and held 
that the present basing point system was 
wrong in principle, and same was abolished. 

3. The commission approved and adopted 
southern classification. 

The foregoing departures from present 
rules, regulations and practices were an- 
nounced in docket 12002. The shippers ac- 
cepted these principles as being settled,and 
no objections were offered by shippers in the 
instant case. t 

4. The commission approved a class mile- 
age scale for general application. 

5. The commission for the first time fixed 
the percentage relations of the lower classes 
to first class. The percentage relationship 
being the same as adopted the federal 
commission in I. & 8. docket 1261.

Special Staff Correspondent. 
Chicago, TL, January 19.—(Spe- 
cial.)—As the result of conferences 
held Thursday by the various’ state 
highways en rs in attendance on 
the-American Roadbuilders’ congress 
at the Coliseum, it was generally 
agreed that it is not practical for a 
state, county or municipality to build 
a road less than 20 feet wide. It was 


which three cars can run abreast is 
dangerous, as automobiles going in 
opposite directions. will have the same 
right of way in the center of the road. 
Thomas H. McDonald, chief of the 
United States bureau of public roads, 
who is a well-known engineer, decla 
that the question of highway widths 
depends on traffic demands. 
“But don’t embarrass your state by 
insisting that. the roads must be 20 
feet wide to begin with in sections 
where traffic is slight. Permit a one- 
lane road with a 10-foot paved sur- 
face on one side of the road to be) 
built until traffic gets heavy enough 
to warrant a two-lane road, 

20-Foot Road Better. 
“There is ho question but that a 
90-foot road is. better than the 18- 
foot road, but there is one thing that 
must not be lost sight of in considering 
a road width—the closer we get to 
the centers of population, the whier 
the road should be in proportion to 
the number of people in the district 
approached.” 
Chief MacDonald, in a conference 


with the persia delegates attending 
the roads congress, states that 


1 Georgia was to be congratulated on 


her highway engineer, W.-R. Neel. 
He declared that Mr. Neel had worked 
as fiard as any engineer in the United 
States to develop Georgia’s highways. 
- He stated that a bond issue for high- 
way construction and maintenance In 
the state would bring about in re- 
turn increased commercial, industrial 
and agricultural development. 
Highway development must depend 
upon a more critical econontic analy- 
sis than in the past and highway 
transport officials must prepare their’ 
case, W. K. Hatt, director of the ad- 


-visory board on highway research, ‘of 


Washington, D. C., told the delegates. | 
Proportion Is Limited. 

“Ihe proportion of the national 

wealth available for the purposes of 

transportation is limited. e propor- 


‘tion must be distributed among the 


various agencies, railroads, highways 
and others. Inasmuch as the money

NEGRO WHO TRIED 
TO ESCAPE SENT 
TO REFORMATORY 


Crippled aecthe result of an injury 
received when he tried to escape from 
postoffice inspectors during a cross- 
examination several months ago, Nel- 
lie Browner, a negro, pleaded guilty 
to violating the postal laws relating 
to sending obscene matter through the 
mails, in the federal court Wednes- 


y. 
Browner was sentenced by Judge 
W. I. Grubb for violating the federal 
law to spend two years in the national 
reform school at Washington. 

While federal inspectors were ques- 


tioning him several months past as to 


his guilt. under - charges brought 
against him, Browner jumped head 
foremost out of the window of the 
Federal building, 35. feet, to the pave- 
ment. He was retaken by the officers 
of the government, as he was unable 
to make good hid escape on account of 
a fractured leg.

An international cérference has 


" ~ been “called to méet at Genoa for

the purpose: of working out ways 
and means to put*the world again 
on the highroad of peace and 
prosperity. 

The United States has received 
a formal invitation to be repre- 
sented at this conference, but. up 
to this time nobody knows whether 
or’ not the invitation will be ac- 
cepted. 

Indeed, indications point to the 
fact that those responsible for the 
administration are still debating 
as fo whether or hot they are suf- 
ficiently “even with Wilson” to 
permit this country to assume its 
just obligation to the balance of 
the world,and particularly to our 
former allies in the world war. 

The world conference has been 
called for the explicit purpose of 


seeing if something cannot be 


done to stabilize conditions in 
Burope, thus to start the world 
once again on a quick-step for- 


wsward march.

To this end the United States 
is as much interested as any 


country in Europe; and, in many} 


respects, more. 50. . 
As a result of the war abd its 


. aftermath this .cbuntry--has. come 


into possession, of more?thap one-

and under existing conditions we 


are deriving absolutely no benefit ‘

show that the factories of that 
country are operating on an 85 per 
cent of full time basis, with em- 


* ployment for everybody who is 


‘willing to work; and the whole 


country is working from sun-Up 


to sun-down, six days each week. 


Here in our country, with more 
than half of the world’s gold, busi- 
ness stagnates, and agriculture, 
which is the very basis of the 


4 . prosperity of the nation, is at a 
_ lower ebb than for many years.

attention of the “public in a news 


} tutjon.today, setting forth some of 
the handicaps under which this 
work is noWw- being carried ‘on. 

For severa] years landowners 
land’ similar ‘development associa- 
tioms”-4n tle “various southern 
states—the Georgia Landowners’ 
‘association, now the Georgia asso- 
Eb rem being .one of them—have 
rendered invaluable service to the 
‘south in the way of developing the 
resourees atid improving rural con- 
ditions generally within their re 
spective states. 

‘These instrumentalities were or- 
ganized by,-and have operated as 
| subsidiaries. to, the Southern Set- 
'tlement and Development organi- 
zation; and- from the parent insti- 
tution each has received a large 
share of its ffmanhcial support. 
| This organization has, in turn, 
been financed mainly by the rail- 
roads serving the’ Soushere terri- 
tory. 

When the government $68t over 
Yhe management and control of the 
railroads: during the war this sup- 
port was withdrawn by order of 
Director Genera] McAdoo, and .he 
organization would probably have, 
gone out-of existence but for the 
generosity and public-spiritedness 
-of its president, S. Davies War- 
field, president of the Seaboard 
‘Air Line railroad, who, during the 
time that his railroad was under 
government control, dug down into 
his own pocket to’ the extent of 
$30,000 that this splendid work 
might ‘continue. 

Since the railroads were turned 
back to their owners.the Southern 
Settlement and Development or- 
ganization has exefted its efforts | 
to induce them to renew their pre- 
war contributions; but the only 
roads which have agreed to do so 
are the Seaboard and the Central 
of Georgia. 

W. A. Winburn, president of the 

latter road, in announcing his will- 
ingness to continue the Central’s 
co-operation said in a letter to 
President Warfield: 
“I sincerely trust .that~+ you. will 
be successful in your éfforts to con- 
tinue Southern . Séttlement and 
Development. organization, ag, in’ 
my Biowran te doing  vaiyable 
work, “and Iam willingsto <én 
tribute ‘for account of thegcentra), 
of Georgia.” 

This is creditable to President 
Wigburn and to the Central ang: 
the’example should be followed by 
every other carrier operating: is 
the south. . 

A cessation of the remarkable 
work the organization is doing, 
and which it is ideally equipped 
to carry forward, would be little 
| short of a calamity to the south! 
- Mr..Warfield truthfully says that 
“it would be a real loss to the 
south to permit this work to stop.” 

Every railroad’ in the south 
should «do its share ¢oward, not 
only keeping this movement alive, 
but toward enabling it to expand 
and increase its usefulness.

Warfield Urges That | 
. Railroads Continue 
Development Work 


““Not Guilty,” But 
* Don’t Do It Again, 
Senator Newberry 


Baltimore, Md., January 19.—Spe- 
cial.)—The Southern Settlement and 
Developmént™ organization, it was 
learned yesterday, will not réceive 
the pre-war subscriptions from the 
railroads of the south. During gov- 
érnmént control, Director General 
McAdoo, did not’ continue the sub- 
ares yey of the subscribing rail- 

though urged to do so. 


During the period of federal con- 
trol, S: Davies Warfield, president 
of the organization, supplied in the 
main,.the funds to continué 7 work 
to the extent of over $30,000 


The announcement was made by 

Vice President Clement S. Ucker aft- 
er a meeting of the executive com- 
mittee of the organization, that only 
two railroads that agreed to renew 
their‘ subscriptione were the Sea- 
board Air Line railway, of which 
Mr, Warfield is president, which 
centinued its subscription and added 
thereto ail during federal control, 
‘and A an of Georgia railway, 
Mr. W. A. Winburn, president. Mr. 
Winburn. in a letter to Mr. War- 
field, stated: 


“I sincefely trust that you will be euc- 
cessful in your efforts to continue the South- 
ern Settlement and Development organization, 
,as, in my opinion, 7 a. doing very valuable 
work and I am willing . . to contribute 
for account fe the Central of ja. 

The Southern Settlement and Devel- 
opment organization has been active 
in the development of the states of 

the gouth during the past ten years. 
Through its effort, and at consid- 
‘erable expense, associations of land- 
owners were organized in the states 
of North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. 
‘Acting with them is the’ Southern 

Cut. -Over Land association, 

iow Orleans. These associations 
are now operating with a large 
number of members, controlling 
many Millions of acres of band. 
The organization nas also been a 
forceful factor in the development 
of the livestock industry of the 
south. It has assisted in securing 
helpful state legislation for cattle- 
tick eradication, dog control laws, 
and other legislation looking to the 
rotection and upbullding of the 

ivestock industry. Being recok- 

niged a’ oné of the foremost factors 
in southern development, the fallure 
wef the other railroads to agree to 
subscribe to the support of this or- 
— is a source of great re- 


gret 
Vice President Ocker stated that 
Mr. Warfield had been requested by 
the executive committee of the or- 
tion, now that most all the

FRANK DOUGLAS 
FAILS TO APPEAR 
IN COURT AGAIN 


For the second time, Frank Doug-

appear on trial in the United States | 
district court Wednesday, has failed 
te make his appearance. By his fail- 
ure to make his appearane, Douglas 
forfeits $20,000 bond. 

According to Hal Lindsay, assistant 
distriet attorney, who is representing 
the United States in the case, the tele- 
gram received m Key West, Fia., 
stating that uglas would be in 
Atlanta Thursday, was probably a 
fake. If the communication was sent 
by Douglas Wednesday, he would have 
had ample time to reach Atlanta by 
Thursday morning in time for trial. 

Douglas was given another day in 
wie to appear for trial, and if he 
does not reach Atlanta by Friday, a 
nation-wide search will be made tor

Editor Constitution: In your fine 
editorial In thig morning’s paper on |. 
“Poe’s Birthday,” you quote a. beau- 
tiful verse from the noted poem of | 
John Henry Boner, of North Caro- 
lina, entitied, 
Fordham.” 

Mr. Boner’s praise of the dead 
poet, and your compliment to Mr. 


both fully deserved, 

But if I am not mistaken, and I 
do not think I am, we have here in 
Georgia and in Atlanta a poet of 
our own whose genius has made an 
equally notable contribution to the 
apareciative literature concerning 

oe. 

I refer to the poem by Major 
Charles W. Hubner, printed on your 
editorial page in The Constitution 
of yesterday, January 18, It con- 
sists of ten stanzas, each fully sus- 
tainéd in critical appreciative and 
melodious measure, 

This stanza will serve to show 
that the praise here given is not 
undeserved: 
“From shadowy shores of Pluto’s 

realm infernal, 
The ‘Raven’ comes, and croaks hia, 
‘nevermore;,’ 
And robed in light and loveliness 
supernal, 
The shade ajspears, whom Angels 
name ‘Lenore.’”’

Trou p Plans 
For Concerted 
Actionin 1922 


Farm Program and Organic 
zation to Be Completed 
Today. 


BY JOHN H. JONES. 

LaGrange, Ga., January 19.—(Spe 
cial.)——After many weeks of prepara- 
tory work, the farmers and business 
men of Troup county will hold an 
important conference Kriday morning 
to complete organization to promote 
diversification along concentrated 
lines and establishment of a market- 
ing system working in close co-oper- 
ation between the city and rural dis-. 
tricts. 

The plan of limitless and unorgan- 
ized diversification will not be fol- 
lowea in Troup this year. Instead, 
a constant campaign is. being waged 
for a set program to conform with 
marketing facilities. Business men 
of the city are supporting the plans 
and will not be static but highly dyna- 
mi¢ throughout the year in order that 
any agricultural crisis which light 
arise may be met with a strong co- 
operativ@association. 

Line of Action. 

Farm demonstration gents, in pro- 
moting the new program, aré stress- 
ing the importance of— 

First, réduction of cotton acreage 
with censeless vigilance in combatting 
the boll weevil. 

Second, production of everything 
possible for home consumption. 

Third, concentration on only two 
or three special money crops such as 
potatoes, peanuts, peas, hogs-or water- 
melons. 

Fourth, careful supervision to as- 
sure uniform preparation for mar- 
keting in great enough volume to 
permit organized methods of disposing 
of products and improving facilities 
through authorities without wasteful

DECREASE SHOWN 
IN UNEMPLOYMENT 
RANKS IN ATLANTA 


That the unemployment situation in 
Atlanta is better than during 1921, 
was disclosed Thursday afternoon in a 
statement by W. E. Hixon, secretary 
of the Atlanta Employers’ association. 
He stated that through Thursday, the 
association had more applications for 
men to fill jobs than were received 
during any two months of 1921. On 
the other hand, applications by men for 
positions, he said, bave decreased. 

In Mr. Hixon’s report to the govern- 
ment on December 17, it was stated 
that there were 6,100 men out of jobs 
in Atlanta, while on January 8, when 
~ last report was made, there were 
only 5,500 men out of jobs, a decrease 
in Atlanta’s army of unemployed of 
600. Mr. Hixon stated that this is a 
conclusive commentary on the better- 
mane of the local unemployment situa-

Glasgow, Thursday, has definitely set- 
tled the question of an immediate 
election. He declared that Lloyd 
George would not call for the dissolu- 
tion of parliament until thy Irish sit- 
uation had been completely settled, 


. and that he had the unanimous back- 
‘ing of the cabinet in this intention. 


“Iintil the legal establishment of 
the Irish provisional government has 
been completed, there can be no dis- 
solution of parliament,’”’ Chamberlain 
announced. 

Asquith Condemns Treaty. 


Herbert H. Asquith, voicing the op- 


' position, was speaking at the same 


time in London. He attacked the gov- 
ernment’s “wasteful expenditures and 
high taxation,” and condemned the 
Versailles treaty. 

Reports that a split in the coalition 
is threatened by which Lloyd George's 
position is rendered insecure, met with 
a vigorous denial by Chamberlain that 
any dissension exists among the lib- 
eral and unionist members of the 
government. 

The situation will not be entirely 


_ clear, nevertheless, until Lioyd George 


has made his eagerly-anticipated 
speech next Saturday, when he is 
expected to make a forceful appeal 
to the country, emphasizing first the 
necessity of lrish peace, with legisla- 
tive action permitting fulfillment of 
the treaty. 
To Plead for Genoa. 

The second point the premier will 
make will be the importance of the 
economic conference at Genoa, stress- 
ing his belief that only through that 
gathering can world trade and Eng- 
land’s commerce be revived. 

As far as Lloyd George is con- 
cerned, the domest‘c situation is com- 
pletely bound up in the international! 
crisis, which explains the premier’s 
anxiety for a readjustment of rela- 
tions with France and his desire to 
stimulate the interest of America in 
liurope’s problems. 

That the Irish question is not 
completely settled from England’s 
standpoint was. made evident in 
(Chamberlain’s speech. 

“We have taken a grave departure 


_ from our Irish policies,” he said. “We 


have entered a new course and we can 
not do anything to jeopardize the 
suceess of our departure. We must 
bring the ship to harbor before we 
take any risks. A solution of the 
Irish question along the lines of the 
treaty is a process which requires 
time.” | -

Pastor Will Denounce 
Maudlin Sentimentality 
In Cases of Murders 


The moral lessons involved in the 
DuPre murder case will be forceful- 
ly set forth in a sermon Sunday night 
at the Baptist Tabernacle by the pas- 
tor, Rev. John W. Ham. He will 
speak upon true repentance and false 
repentance, and set forth in graphic 
style Biblical instances of false re- 
pentance in which men evidenced a 
great sorrow for wrong doing after 
they were caught up with and brought 
to justice. The pastor says that he 
intends to show that maudlin senti- 
mentality is doing much to lessen re- 
spect for the majesty of the law and 
is weakening the hands of the officials 
of the law in detecting criminals and 
bringing them to justice. He states 
he will also deal with female erimi- 
nals who aid and abet criminals in 
filching property and destroying lives 
in order ‘to get away with it. 

“I propose,” he said, “to deal un- 
sparingly with the subject announced 
and take a firm position for the pro- 
tection of life and property and the 
administration of even-tempered jus- 
tice. Life has become so cheap in 
the minds of some people that they 
have no conscience on the subject and 
speak of it as ‘boring’ those who 
would stand in the way of their acts 
of robbery. The public needs to be 
saved from all of this sob stuff and 
let’s get down to protecting society 
from future tragedies such as have 
been enacted recently.” 


VANGUARD CLASS WILL 
GIVE DINNER TONIGHT 


The Vanguard class of the Pryor 
Street Presbyterian church will give 
a banquet to the men of the church 
on Friday evening at 7:30. An or- 
chestra will furnish music and |ws- 
sibly a good quartet. George M. Na- 
pier and Mayor Key will respond to

Macon, Ga., January 19.—(Special.) 
The case of J. M. Davis, father of 
ten. children, who has been on trial 
here for two days on a charge of mur- 
dering his brother-in-law, Elmer P. 
Jones, went to the jury this evening, 
following four hours devoted to argu- 
ments in the case. 

The case was kard fought, the state 
endeavoring to show that the killing 
took place in the road some distance 
from the Davis home, while the defense 
endeavored to prove that Jones was 
advancing on Davis in the latter's yard 


an that Davis-shot to protect him- 
self. 


Testimony brought out during the 
trial showed that Jones was intoxi- 
eated at the time. Despite the fact 
that her father, mother and other kin 
have been arrayed against her hus- 
band, Mrs. Davis has been standing 
staunchly by him during the trial.

rted by the finance com- 

which ihe conference ap- 
proved. It was announced that the 
vote on the added provision was 22 to 
8, and was taken after the conference 
had voted down, 24 to 15, an amend- 
ment by Senator Smoot, of Utah, that 
the commission that is to conduct the 
refunding negotiations should not have 
the right to fix a rate of interest at 
less than 5 per cent. 

Party leaders said it was the plan 
to take up the bill in the senate Mon- 
day an@ to press for its passage, the 
amended measwre having been formal- 
ly ey by the conferfence. The 
republicans already have voted to take 
up a soldier bonus biil as soon as the 
refunding measure 18 disposed of. It 
was said that there would be fur- 
ther party conferences to determine 
a policy as to the method of raising 
the necessary funds to finance the 
bonus. 

There were two conferences today. 
with many changes in the refunding 
bill suggested, but not approved. 
metion by a Senator France, of Mary- 
land, to strike out the provision for 
a commission and to confer the entire 
authority on the president was de- 
feated, it was announced, by a vote 
of 31 to 7. It alao was stated that 
u motion by Senator Phipps, of Col- 
orado, te strike out the requirement 
that. the bonds mature not later than 
June 15, 1947, was defeated, 32 to 5. 
Another motion lost was by Senator 
Harreld, Oklahoma, which would have 
provided that the payment of interest 
on the bonds be deferred for a period 
of not more than three years.

The Atlanta Opera club has changed 
the date of rehearsal for this week 
only. The next rehearsal will be held 
Friday night, at Phillips & Crew’s 
Steinway hall at 8 o’clock. The club

sons and daughters of the war be- 
tween the states in a_ celebration 
Thursday afternoon of the birthdays 


monies held in’ the house of represent: | 
atives’ hall at the state capitol. Judge 
John 8. Candler was orator of the day 
and he paid earnest tribute to the 


memory of General Lee, whose birth: 
day falls on January 19, and General 
‘Jackson, whose birthday anniversary 
is January 21, - 

Judge Candler delivered his inspir- 
ing address, old southern melodies 
were sung by the Kinghts Templar 
double quartet; crosses of honor were 

presented to six confederate veterans 
ahd ti the old soldiers themselves took 
charge of the program when the stir- 
ring strains of Dixie were played. 
The ceremonies were the most enjoy- 
able yet given at this annual event 
and the largest crowd that has at- 
tended them in years was present. 
The big hall was filled to caracity 
while large crowds were seated in the 
t balconies. 


Old Soldiers Enter. 


J. S. Dozier headed the column of 
old soldiers who marched from the 
lobby of the capitol to the hall up- 
stairs. As commander of Camp 159, 
United Confederate veterans, he pre- 
sided at the ceremonies. ‘The invoca- 
tion was pronounced by’ Rev. D. P. 
Cleveland. The musical program, car- 
ried out under the direction of Mrs. 
Charles Love, consisted of songs by 
the Knights Templar double quartet 
and musical numbers played by an or- 
chestra furnished by the American 
Federation of Musicians led by Carl 
Karston and composed of Mrs. J. R. 
Braswell, C. E. Barber, C. L. Wil- 
liams, Frank B. Zelie, ©. Reynolds 
Clark and Carl Karston. — 

Mrs. John A. Perdue, head of the 
Atlanta’ chapter, United Daughters of 
the Confederacy, made a short speech 
preceding the -presentation of the 
crosses of honor by Mrs. Hal Hentz. 
Those who received the crosses were 
Chaplain John A. Kandolph, Fort Mc- 
Phergon, and N. L. Bennett, T. J. 
Buchanan, J. 8. Puckett, George W. 
Smith and W. B. Willis. The ushers 
at the ceremony were members of the 
Margaret Wilson chapter, of the. Chil- 
dren of the Confederacy. 

Judge George Hillyer introduced 
Judge Candler. In a short speech 
Judge Hillyer paid tribute to the 
memory of General Lee and General 
Jackson, and reviewed some of the 
outstanding events in their careers. 
He then presented Judge Candler to 
the ee 

Judge Candler Speaks. 

Judge Candler spoke eloquently of 
the leadership of Lee and Jackson. 
He reviewed the life of each of the | 
generals and pictured the incidents in 
their lives which drew out the strong- 
est parts of their natures. He declared 
that the south need never fear of 
what history will say about the Icad- 
ers of the confederacy. 

“No people, ancient or modern, can 
look with more pride to the verdict 
which history will be compelled to 
render upon the merits and characters 
of our leaders,’ Judge Candler said. 


of fortunate results and heroes be- 
cause of success. Lee and Jackson, 
because of qualities in themselves, are 
great in the face of fortune and heroes 
in ‘spite of defeat.” 

Judge Candler then praised the 
leadership of southern statesmen who 


whom Je characterized as “publi 
fice “dovetail vices, private cit 
withe wron 

proach, Christians without ey 
ahd men ‘without guile.” He sa

ful as Roman vestals in duty; sub-

grand in battle as Achilles. 
ghts of States. 

“One comfort the southern people 
and their children must have,” Judge 
Candler continued, “whether consti- 
tutional government shall continue or 


or be obliterated ; whether liberty shal] 
be recovered or die the death that 
knows no- waking—we shall be vindi- 
cated. If the union of states under 
constitutional government and secur- 
ing the blessings of liberty be recover- 
= and a the work can be 
done 0 y returning to the great 
principles for which we struggled. The 
genera] government must be restrained 
within the limitations of its constitu- 
tional delegated powers and the states 
restored to the unrestrained control 
of their domestic affairs under the 
reserved rights, or union states and 
liberty must perish. If this glorious 
work’: shall have success, then, the 
rejoicings of according states and hap- 

y millions from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific and from the lakes to the 
gulf, will syllable forever the halle- 
lujahs of southern triumphs. 

“But if blindness, madness, hate and 
ambition shall continue, further con- 
centration of power at Washington 
be approved and principles of federal 
administration as now exercised con- 
tinue, then the wail that shall come 
up from the universal wreck of un- 
ion, states and liberty, and will drown 
the thunder in loud vindication of 
southern wisdom ard fidelity. The 
graves of I.ee and Jackson will be- 
comé Meccas for journeying, sorrow- 
stricken pilgrims of right for ages to 
come, and the future historian, re- 


| viewing the records you carefully. shalll 


have preserved, will write the last epi- 
_taph for the confederate dead—“These 
| were the last heroes of freedom in 
America.” 

After Jud a Candler had concluded 
his speech, Judge Hillyer made a mo. 
tion that it be printed and distrib- 
uted. The motion was carried by a 
rising vote of approval. 

Mrs. Perdue then announced that 
the United Daughters of the Confed- 
eracy are working in a movement to 
preserve “Arlington,” the old home of 
General Lee, as a shrine for descend- 
ants of confederate soldiers. She de- 
clared that there has been some oppo- 
sition in congress, but said the women 
oe the confederacy ‘would win in their

dent Carson " vice president last 
J mg - Boehm presided at 


to Woodrow Wilson and 
General Robert E. Lee were other fea- 
tures of the meeting. Alfred C. 
Newell, in explaining the Wilson foun- 
dation movement and asking that sub- 
scriptions be made by the association 
members, said that Wilson’s name 
will go down immortalized.” Julian 
Boehm said that Wilson is “one of the 
test men of all times, and I hope 
is name will go down in history as 
such.” Snbseriptions were taken up 
at the door. 

Thomas Peters eulogized General 
Lee, and told of an incident during the 
Virginia campaign, when he was iv 
Lee’s army. ‘The incident was that 
General Lee ate nothing but “corn in 
the shucks,” just as the enlisted men 
did, and Mr. Peters said that that 
spoke volumes. “I haven't eloquence 
enough,” he said, “to do justice te 
Lee’s life and character, but I think 
it would be appropriate for us to stand 


in silence for a moment in memory to 


the great son of the south.” Follow- 
ing which, everybody stood with bowed 
heads. 

Following a report of the incorpora- 
tion committee, a resolution calling for 
the drafting of plans to have the asso- 
ciation incorporated, was passed. A 
resolution thanking the Citizens and 
Southern, the Fournth Negtional and 
the Fulton National, for their recent 
insurance advertising in the local pa- 
pers also was passed. MR. F. Sheddep 
reported on the work of the institu- 
tional advertising committee, which 
has carried numerous non-partisan in- 
surance advertising notices in the loca] 
papers, and said that letters of in- 
quiry about the advertising campaigr 
aera been received from every section 
of the nation. A _ resolution was 

passed calling for letters to be sent to 
the residents of American insurance 
compauies for the purpose of inaugu- 
rating a similar campaign on a na- 
tional scale.

a world of suffering,” said Ed W. 
Field, 538 Jefferson St., Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. 

“My case proved that when a man’s 
stomach goes wrong, everything goes 
wrong with him. The first thing I 
noticed out of the way was loss of ap- 
petite and next, that no matter how 
sparingly I ate, I Was sure to have an 
attack of indigestion. This was two 
years ago and from that time on, until 
after I started on Tanlac. I kept go- 
ing down hill at a steady rate. I 
finally got so I couldn’t walk a couple 
of blocks without having to stop and 
rest and I was so nervous that often I 
sat up in a chair all night long.

Kappa Alphas 


Celebrate 


Birthday of Robert E. Lee 


One of the most brilliant social af- 
fairs of the January calendar was 
the dinner-dance Thursday evening 
at the Piedmont Driving club, given 
by the Kappa Alpha Alumni associa- 
tion of Atlanta in celebration of 
the birthday of General Robert E. 
Lee, the patron saint of the fraternity. 

Robert E. Lee is closely identified 
with the founding of this fraternity, 
his guiding hand at Washington and 
Lee university, where the order was 
founded, helped much to instill those 
lasting virtues of his in the ritual of 
the order, and whose ideals have had 
much to do with the prominent po- 
sition that Kappa Alpha occupies in 
eollege fraternity circles. It is the 
custom of Kappa Alphas throughout 
the country to observe his birthday 
as their annual celebration day. 


Elaborate Decorations. 


The ballroom of the club was elab- 
orately decorated, palms, potted 
plants and flowers in the fraternity 
colors of crimson and yellow being 
used in profusion. Placed over the 
entrance to the ballroom and draped 
in the fraternity colors was a portrait 
of Robert E. Lee, and at the far end 
of the room, suspended over the fire- 
place, brilliantly lighting the ball- 
room, was the Kappa Alpha insignia, 
the tiny lights also in the colors off 
crimson and yellow. 

Dinner was served at 8 o’clock, a 


long table before the fireplace was 
artistically arranged for the officers of 
the fraternity and their wives. Indi- 
vidual tables were placed around the 
outer edge of the room, the center of 
each being graced with a small basket 
of yellow and crimson blossoms. 


Alumni Officers. 
The officers of the alumni are Mell 
R. Wilkinson, peeeornt Hal Hentz, 


vice president; L. Avery, 
treasurer, and Don Watts, secretary. 


During dinner new officers for the en- | 


suing year were elected. 


Prominent among the local mem- 
bers of the EE “fy Alpha alumni pres- 
ent were Dr. K. G. Matheson, presi- 
dent of Georgia Tech; R. L. Avery, 
Dr. W. J. Blalock, M. L. Brittain, 
Howard Candler, Hon. C. Murphey 
Candler, Judge J. S. Candler, Bishop 
W. A. Candler, Milton Dargan, Hon. 
Hugh Dorsey, E. R. DuBose, Henry 
Heinz, Judge Frank Harwell, Clark 
Howell, Judge T. H. Jeffries, Dr. 
Ashby Jones, Judge BE. C. Kontz, 
Bishop H. J. Mikell, Dr. W. F. Mel- 
ton, Dr. William Perri. Nicholson, 
Sr., Judge Arthur Powell, Mell R. 
Wilkinson. 

The occasion assembled over 200 
guests, including members of _ the 
Georgia Tech, Emory and Oglethorpe 


chapters of Kappa Alpha.

Dr. Lomax, of the University of 
Texas, is completing a tour of many 
eastern cities. He occupies a unique 
place in American literature. As a 
college boy at Harvard he wrote for 
one of his classes a theme on the life 
and songs of the western cowboy, in 
which he brought out the fact that 
these ballads had never been written 
and that as a different civilization 
took on the west, they 
would eventually die out. 

His work was so well done that he 
attracted the attention of the faculty 
which won for him the Sheldon Fel- 
lowship for the Investigation of Amer- 
iean Ballads. He went back home to 
Texas and made his collection of cow-

Jeanne raised her lips gingerly to 
meet his kiss. 

“Careful of my powder and lip f

He laughed and kissed her without

her close and burying his face after-

Who's Who in the Story. 


Jeanne (Jane) Dare, beautiful, 
clever, but poor, resolves to stake ev- 
erything to achieve a wealthy mar- 
riage and, after raising all the money © 
she can through mortgages, savings, 
and borrowings, aided undillingly by 

Henry Harrison, her childhood 
sweetheart, and ho suitor for 
her hand, comes to New York, where 
she believes eligible men ‘are to be 
found, and establishes herself as a 
woman of wealth and fashion at one of 
the smartest hotels, where she meets 


Richard Canby, a wealthy broker 
and man-about-town, who is attract- 
ed by her beauty and introduces her 
into his set, in which are 


Adele Parkinson, a vivacious young 
widow, former flame of Canby's, who 
befriends Jeanne, and 


Victor Bartstowe. young, handsome, 
debonair, only son of a multimillion- 
aire, whom Jéanne marks a3 her prey. 
Barstowe is instantly attracted and 
comes to tea when Jeanne persuades 
Signor Bonnicetti, a famous Italian 
violinist, also smitten with her beau- 
ty, to play for her guests. Harrison 
arrives unexpectedly with the news 
that he can raise no more money on 
her sworthless property in Iowa; but

needed. They were treatd kindly but 
they knew that they were not neces- 
hsary to anyone. 

It seems tome that the surest specif: 
ic against this kind of loneliness is 
to become necessary to yourself. May- 
be that is an awkward way of putting 
what I want to say. What I mean 
is this—to cultivate resources with- 
-t yourself which will make you such 
a good companion for yourself that 
you will not be entirely dependent on 
the companionship of others. | 
There Can Be Fun in Looking On. 

It is inevitable that as one grows 
older one must do more looking on and 
less joining in the pageant. One’s 
joys become less often the joys of sen- 
sation and more often the joys of 
thought. Now many people, instead 


of cultivating the joys that are pos- 
sible to advancing years, try desper- 


tional joy. 


One is made to feel the 


emotions that the actors are simu- 
lating. By and by, however, one comes 
to take a different kind of pleasure 
in the theater ; one realizes it is an art, 
one appreciates all the intricate skill 
in the making of the play and in the 


acting of it. 


One cannot lose one- 


self as thoroughly as at first, and 
yet the pleasure in its way is just as 


great. . 


I think everyone who is approach- 
ing the middle years ought to ask him- 
self if he is cultivating this more last- 
ing form of enjoyment, and see that 
the answer is in the affirmative.

Jeanne, becoming fearful of her cap- ,

the market just before she leaves for 
a week-end party at which Barstowe

Barstowe and one viewed with favor

THE FIRST 
OVERTURE. 

Jeanne endeavored to dispel the 
grimness of Canby’s expression as he 
waited for her explanation hy a laugh 
and a mock shudder. 

“Brr! How stern he looks! Have 
I done something he disapproves of?” 


Canby drummed impatiently on the 
table with cigar case. 

“Why didn’t you tell me you had 
been invited to Barstowe’s dinner?” he 
repeated. 

Jeanne shrugged, playing with the 
chain of her meshbag. 

“And why should I bore you, my 
friend, with an account of my petty 
activities? I didn’t think you would 
be interested.”

“Hardly!” Jeanne shrugged, rais- 
ing grave eyes to Canby’s hot ones. 
“Few men love me—though I amuse 
and divert a great many. Y6u and 
your young friends, Mr. Barstowe, 
are of the latter class,” she added 
smilingly. 

Canby’s eyes held hers. 

“You're sure of that?” 

Jeanne laughed. 

“Speak for yourself! I'll try to 
rem@mber to ask Mr. rstowe for | 
his Opinion the very next time I see 
him.” | 

Canby merely grunted a reply. 


crazy about you already—but you 
know mothers! It takes a little while 
for them to adjust themselves to the 
idea of losing the son of the family. 
Daughters are another matter. But 
don’t you bother your beautiful head. 
Mother will come around all right !” 
“But I doné’ like that!” said Jeanne 
slowly. “Perhaps I'm_ ridiculously 
proud, but I’ve always rather expected 
any family to welcome me wholeheart- 
edly. In fact, in Paris, the Duc de 
, well, 1 won’t mention his name 
—it’s hardly loyal—but the family of 
more than one nobleman. was rather 
anxious to welcome me.” 
Barstowe drew her to him again 
and kissed her gently, tenderly. 
“Please, darling, don’t feel this way! 
It’s nothing—only the suddenness of 
it—that’s kept the family from spread- 
ing the news of our engagement broad- 
cast. | They’re proud of it, I tell you 


Jeanne hid her little twisted smile 
against his coat lapel. She permifted 
him to hold her close for a minute or 
so, and then she drew away and went 
into her dressiug room to powder her 
nose. 

There was the light of battle in her 
eyes, and her fierce, indominatable 
will was never more in the ascendant. 

She would win! She must! 

Fifteen minutes later she was be- 
ing seated in a box at the Bonnicetti 
concert. Barstowe was beside her. He 
had determined to divide his time be- 
tween her box and his mother’s, which 
was directly opposite. 

Jeanne looked across at the older 
woman, swathed in fabulous sables, 
with Vera Dayton and the girl in the 
crimson toque beside her, and gave 
her a formal, courteous bow. 

But, to her amazement, Mrs. Bar- 
stowe smiled, frostily, but unmistaka- 
bly, and gestured to the empty chairs 
in her box. It was an invitation.

fashion ever dared to remain. When 
it first arrived we said it was for 
the minority. We felt assured, and 
had every reason for our conviction, 
that the vast majority of women could 
not hope to retain or achieve beauty 
with such a trying and hazardous de- 
colletage. Every one thought that the 
experiment was doomed to failure. 
What is the end of all our proph- 
ecies? A world-wide acceptance of 
the neckline and a continuance of it 
throughout all argument. Nothing the 
dressmakers. have said or done ‘con- 
vineced or persuaded women to cut 
their frocks any other way at the 
neck. Did the trade cater to this 
verdict? Was, it because so many 
thousands of frocks were turned out 
by machinery in our well-known and 
reckless manner that the world ceased 
to expect a change? Women settled 
down to regard this kind of opening 
at the neck as one of the essentials 
of dress, something running on sched- 
ule and not subject to change, even

__* Canby Proves Persistent. 
“What did that Dayton girl mean 
by giving Barstowe your love?’ 
Again Jeanne shrugged. 
“Are you of the Inquisition?” she 
inquired mildly. “Because I assure 
you that I have no idea what she 
meant unless she, like you, wished to 
tease me about Mr. Barstowe’s atten- 
tions,” 
“I’ve heard she’s engaged to Vic 
herself,” vouchsafed Canby. “If she 
isn't; it isn’t her fault.” 
Jeanne made no comment and he 
added : 
“By the way, didn’t she say some- 
thing about a Bonnicetti concert this 
afternoon? Like to go? Il can get 
tickets at the club.” 
Jeanne shook her head and began 
to draw on her gloves. 
“I had tickets myself—Signor Bon- 
nicetti sent them to me, but I gave 
them to Alicia Forbes,” 
“Bonnicetti’s good. Better let me 
get seats,” persisted Canby. 
But Jeanne was guided by some 
sixth sense which urged her to return 
bome. 
“Sorry, but 1 have an appointment 
at my modiste’s,” she fibbed, choosing 
the lair least likely to be penetrated 
by masculine escort. She knew that, 
assured as Canby was of her indepen- 
dence, he would hardly risk accum- 
panying any girl to a modiste’s. 
é took her to the door of Madame 
Julie's, however, and Jeanne was 
forced to go meekly, inwardly chafing 
at the delay, as his car made slow 
progress through the traffic. She bade 
Canby a hasty goodgye and vanished 
into the shop until his car had dis- 
appeared in the distance. Then che 
hurried out, signalling a taxi—but 
not before Madame Julie had' tempted 
her with a French creation which 
‘had just come in, and she had fallen. 
It wag priced a good deal higher than 
the amount of the cheque Canby had 
given her to complete her winnings on 
the stock investment; but Jeanne told 
herself that she must save no expense 
to impress the Barstowe family with 
her desirability as a prospective 
daughter-in-law. 

Just in Time. 
When she entered her sitting room, 
she blessed her sixth sense, for her 
telephone was ringing; and, when she 
took down the receiver, it was Victor 
Barstowe’s voice that greeted her. 
“This is the first moment I’ve had 
to ring you up today, sweetheart,” he 
explained. “Mother and Vera and 
the French girl have gone to Bonni- 
eetti’s concert, and I’m to join them 
later; but I had to have a moment 
with you.. If you’re not busy, may I 
drop in for half an hour.” 

Jeanne was thinking rapidly. He 
had made no mention of luncheon— 
yet it was impossible that Vera had 
not told him about seeing her with 


Canby. 

She also wr that the reason 
he had not called hear earlier that 
day was because he had been going 
through an accounting with his par- 
ents—with his mother, at least! 


“So sorry,” Jeanne reached a decis-

THE OLD MAN’S BIRTHDAY. 


Ted looked at himself solemnly in 
the glass and wondered if he looked 
as old as he felt. He was a year 
older today than he was’ yesterday. 
He decided it was time to be settling 
down_and looking dignified. 

“Good morning, kid,” greeted his 
older brother. 

“I wish you'd stop calling me that,” 
said Ted. 

“Oh, I forgot,” his brother grinned. 
“You’re having a birthday, arent’ you? 
Bet you think old Methusalah had 
nothing on you.” 

“Why don’t you have some of your 
pals over and play some games or 
something?’ suggested Marion, his 
sister. ' 

“The fellows I go with don’t like 
parties,” he answered with dignity. 
Marion’s eyes twinkled. After 
breakfast Ted noticed his sister and 
his mother with their heads together. 
Then Marion spent a long time at 
the phone, but he didn’t think much 
about it at the time. 

Ted came home from school that 
afternoon and went up to his room to 
start a new book he had received: for 
his birthday. About dinner time he 
heard someone coming up the walk, 
and he glanced out. An old man, lean- 
ing on a cane, was coniing in. While 
Ted was wondering where he had seen 
the man before, Marion called for him 
to come down. - 

“I have invited some of your old 
friends -over for dinner,” she said, 
gravely. “I have given them easy 
chairs in the living room. Come in,” 
Ted followed her. He entered the 
room. His eyes widened. There were 
six old men with flowing beards and 
canes. Then Ted recognized Stubby’ 
Aiken behind the cotton beard of the 
old man nearest him. Ted grinned. 
“Your friends were just telling some 
of their experiences when they were 


young,” Marion. Ted sat down, : IGK wet @ort

Marilyn Fox made a bottle flute. ,}% 
She attached eight bottles of various 
sizes to a strip of cardboard with 
pieces of heavy string, as shown in 
tigure 2. The bottles were arranged 
in graduated order, running from the 
smallest bottle to the largest. The 
necks of the bottles were allowed to 
extend a little above the edge of the:

But equally as novel as the bottie 
flute was Beatrice Minn’s rubber band 


harp. She placed a number of brady 
in the two long edges of a deep cigar 
box. Then, over these little nails sie 
stretched rubber bands of various 
sizes, placing the thickest bands at’ 
one end of the box and graduating 
them to the other end. 

_In order to stretch the bands suffi- 
ciently to make them hum when |

It was Bthel’s brother who “saved 


the day” when she and her three 
chums were about to give up trying 
to find something to do for their part 
of the Girls’ club “Stunt Night” pro- 
grain. 

“Why don’t you get up an orchestra 
and give ‘em some music?” Al sug- 
gested. 

“But none of us play a thing,” 
Ethel. “How can we give any?” 

“Easy,” replied Al, and went on 
to explain how each of the four girls 
could make an instrument of her own 
and learn to play in no more than 
three or four hours’ time. 


Ethel’s Paper Whistle. 


Ethel made a paper whistle. Figure 
1 shows how she did it. A concave 
cut was made in two pieces of thin 
wood. The pieces were fitted together 
with a strip of writing paper between. 
By putting the whistle between her 
teeth and blowing through the open- 
ing she made a most weird sound. 
“Practice a little,” said Al, “and you'll 
be able to get real tunes out of it.”

. THE WOMAN OF POISE 


Once a rarity, is now to be observed 
and admired upon every hand. Indeed, 
no other woman can flourish long in 
the midst of this modern, complicated 
life. _In the home, in business, in so- 
ci@ life, the woman who is*serene and 
confident wins, while the nervous, flus- 
tered individual wastes her talents and 
gets nowhere. Of course, poise is de- 
pendent mainly upon sound health and 
steady nerves. If you feel that you 
are being kept back in this way, why 
not turn to that great woman's rem- 
edy, Lydia KE. Pinkham’s Vegetable 
Compound, which was manufactured 
from a thorough understanding of the 
nervous system of women ?—( adv.)

furniture that any house can own is a 


full length mirror. It is not vanity | 
entirely which induces a woman -to [| 


look into a mirror. It is an earnest 
and commendable desire to improve 
her personal appearance. The man 
who was father to six young daugh- 
ters had the right idea when he had 
long mirrors set all over his house so 
that his girls could scarcely go into 


any room without being able to see | 


themselves from head to toe. He un-’ 
derstood psychology. He knew that 
the girls would grow up holding them- 
selves properly and wearing their 
clothes well, if their faults of walk- 
ing and standing were always evi- 
dent. : , 

If you do not like a great many 
mirrors in yopr room, a splendid idea 
is to have one hanging on the inside 
of your closet door. Incidentally 
this is an economical idea for a good 
quality full-length mirror with bevel- 
ed edges and even the plainest wood 
frame cost quite a bit of money. 

But it is perfectly practical to pur- 
chase a piece of glass 41-2 feet by 2, 
which can be hung in the cheapest 
frame on the inside of the closet door, 
which will give you a full-length re- 


| flection of yourself; 41-2 feet, by the 


way, is no where near a grown wom- 
an’s size, but if you hang the mirror 
with its top at the level of your head, 
you will have no difficulty in seeing 


your feet and all your figure when you 
stand a few feet away from it. Such 
a mirror would not cost very much. 
Besides, it could be ewung so as to re- 
flect every part of the room, so that 
with the aid of your bureau mirror, 
you can get an excellent back and 
front view of yourself. It will be a 
great help when you dress. 


Very Anxioti&—You have not injur- 
ed your skin by this excessive use of 
hot water, it will improve very quick- 
ly if you follow the bath with cool 
then cold water and occasionally rub 
a small piece of ice over the face and 
throat. 3

more quickly than long hair because 
the scalp is secreting the same as it 
would for longer hair. In such a 
case shampoo oftener than you would

hair will likely recover, but you can 
hasten it by massaging the scalp each 
day and applying a good tonic several 
times each week.

(Continued from Yesterday.) 
CHAPTER XXI. ” 
After the first burst of speed, Bard 


now- 
ing that he could neven catch her, first 
because her horse carried a burden so 
much lighter than bis own, but above 
all because the girl seemed to know 
every rock and twist in the trail, and 
rode as courageously through the 
night as if it bad road day. 
When at length they arrived at the 
old house of Drew, they had been far 
less than five hours on the way, yet 
his long detour to the south had given 
him three days of hard riding to cover 


the same points. 


_. Sally slipped from her horse and 
jerked the reins over its head. In an- 
other moment she had untied the cinch 
and drawn off the saddle. 
its weight easily on one forearm and 
went directly through the door of the 
house. 

He heard the crazy floor creak be- 
neath her weight, the saddle dropped 
with a thump; a match scratched and 
a flight of -shadows shook across the 
“doorway. He unsaddled, and carried 
the saddle into the room. He found 
Sally crouched at the fire and piling 
bits of wood on the rising flame. At 
his coming she smiled briefly up at 
him and turned immediately back to 
the fire, The silence of that smile 
brought their comradeship sharply 
home to him. It was as if she under- 
stood his weariness and knew that the 
fire was infinitely comforting. 

He sat om one of the bunks, and 
when she took her place on the other 
he studied her covertly, with side 
glances, for he was beginnng to feel 
strangely self-conscious. She _ turned, 
observed him. Her chin rested on 
her hands, now, so that when she 
spoke her head nodded a little and gave 
a significance to what she said. 

gg gray doesn’t belong to you?’ 

of - 0.” 

“Hoss-lifting,” she mused. “Who'd 
you drop, Bard?’ 
‘The one they call Calamity Ben.” 

“Is he done for?’ 

“Ves.” 

“In a couple of hours we'd better 
ride on.” 

“I don‘t intend to ride on.” 

She turned squarely on the bunk 
and faced him. 

“You're going to hit the trail in an 
hour, understand?’ 

“If I do, it will be to ride back to- 
ward Drew.” 

Her lips parted to make an angry 
retort, and then he watched her steel 
herself with patience, like a mother 
teaching an old lesson to a child. 

“Follow me _ close, Bard. It you 
don’t do what I say I'll cut loose and 
feave you alone bere.” He made no 
reply, and after a moment she said: 
“That sopnds like quittin’ cold on you. 
it unless you try some fool 
thing like riding back toward Drew.” 

“Don’t you see that the last thing I 
want is to keep you with me. A girl's 
reputation is a fragile thing, Sally.” 

“Meaning that they’d talk about me! 
Bard, they’ve already said enough 
things about me to fill a book—notes 
and all, with a bunch of pictures 
thrown in. What I can’t live duwn I 
fight down, and no man never says 
the same thing twice about me. It 
ain’t healthy. If that’s all that both- 
ers you, close your eyes and let me 
deal you out of this mess. I guess we 
van stay here tonight without no dan- 
ger. And in the morning—well, the 
morning can take care of itself. I’m 
going to turn in.” 

He rose obediently and stood at the 
door, facing the night. From behind 
came the rustle of clothes, and the 
sense of her followed and surrounded 
and stood at his shoulder calling to 
him to turn. 

At:length: “All right, Anthony. It’s 
your turn.” 

She was lying on her side, facing the 
wall, a little heap of clothes on the 
foot of her bunk, and the lithe lines of 
her body something to be guessed at— 
sensed beneath the heavy blanket. He 
slipped into his own bunk and lay 
watching the heavy drift of shadows 
across the ceiling. He strove to think, 
but the waves of light and dark blot- 
ted from his mind all except the feel- 
ing of her_nearness. 

He turned to the wall and shut his 
eyes. For a time he dared not move. 
He was feeling for himself like a man 
who fumbles his way down a dark pas- 
sage dangerous with obstructions. All 
1e knew was an overpowering will to 
see her. He turned, inch by inch, lit- 
‘la degree by degree, knowing that if, 
when he turned, he looked into her 
ayes, the end would rush upon® them, 
»verwhelm them, carry them along like 
straws on the flooding river. At last 
ais head was turned, he looked. 

She lay on her back smiling as she 
slept. One arm hung down from the 
bunk and the graceful fingers ttailed, 
nalm up, on the floor, curling a litfle, 
as if she had just relaxed her grasp on 


something. And down past her shoul- | 


der, half covering the whiteness of her 
arm, fled the torrent of brown hair. 
with the firelight playing through it 
like a sunlit mist. 
Finally he rose, and dressed with 
eaution, for he knew that he must go 
at once. He stooped and smoothed 
down the blankets of his bunk, for no 
trace of him must be seen if any other 
man should come during the night. He 
would go far away—see and be seen— 
apart from Sally Fortune. He picked 


up his saddle and stole step by step 
~aeross the floor, to the door, to the 


night. ; 
CHAPTER XXII. 

It was not long after the departure 
ef Bard that Sally Fortune awoke. 
For a step had cracked on the floor, 
and she looked up to find Steve Nash 
standing in the center of the room 
with the firelicht gloomily about him: 

n 
‘squat figure, stood Shorty Kilrain. 
“Where's your side-kicker?” asked 
Nash. “Where's Bard?” 

And looking across the room, she 
sow that the other bunk was emnty. 
She raised her arms quickly, as if to 
-tifle a yawn, and sat up in the bank. 


JUST NUTS 


She held 


PAST a 


d. blocking the door with his |. 


holding the blanket close about her 
shoulders. The face she showed Nasb 
was caimly contemptuous. 

“ie bird seems to De flown, eh?” 
she queried. 

“Where is he?” he repeated, and 
made a step nearer. “Out with it. 
‘the tenderfvot ain’t left his woman far 
away. Where's he gone? Who's he 
gone to shoot in the back? Where's 
the hoss he started out to rustle?” 

“Kind of peeved, Nash, eh?? 

He leaned, caught her wrist in a 
crushing pressure. 

“You demon; you she-devil !”’ 
( She whiried out of the bunk, the 
blanket caught about ser like the toga 
} of some ancient Roman girl, and as 
she moved she bad swept up something 
heavy and bright from the floor. 

All this, and still his grip was on 
her left arm. 

“Drop your hand, Nash.” 

- He threw her from him and stood 
snarling like a dog growling for the 
bone it feared to touch because there 
may be poison in the taste. 

“If I wrung that throat of yours,” 
he said, “I knew I couldn’t get out of 
you where he’s gone.” 

“Because I dont’ know, you see.” 

“Don’t know?” 

“He’s given me tthe slip.” 

“That‘s another lie.” 

She watched him with a strange, 
sneering smile. Then she stepped 
close, 

“T’ll tell you what ought to make 
you happy. He don’t care for me no 
more than I care for—you, Steve, I 
threw myself at him. I dunno why 
I’m tellin’ vou, except it’s right that 
you should know. But he don’t want 
me: he’s gone on withont me.” 

“An’ you like him still!” 

She merely stared, with a sick smile. 

“My God!’ he murmured, shaken 
deen with wonder. 

He turned on his heel, beckoned to 
Kilrain, who had stood moveless 
through the strange dialogue, and went 
out into the night. 

They rode off at a slow trot, like 
men who have resigned themselves to 
a long journey, and Sally watched 
them from the door. Then she went 
back to her bunk. 

No tears were in her. eyes; 


they 


were wide and solemn, looking up to 


the shadows of the ceiling. 

She woke with the smell of frying 
bacon pungent in her nostrils. What 
she saw was Anthony Bard kneeling 
by the coals of the fire over which 
steamed a coffee-pot on one side and 
a pan of crisping bacon on the other. 

The vision shook her so that she 
rubbed her eyes and stared again to 
make sure. It did not seem possible 
that she had actually wakened during 
the night and found him gone, and 
with this reality before her she was 
strongly tempted to believe that the 
coming of Nash was only a_ vivid 
dream. 

“Morning, Anthony.” 

He turned his head quickly and 
smiled to her. 

“Hello, Sally.” 

He was back at once turning the 
bacon, which was done on the first 
side. Seeing that his back was turn- 
ed, she dressed quickly. 

“How'd you sleep?” 

“Well.” 

‘Where?’ 

He turned more slowly this time. 

“You woke up in the middle of the 
night?’ 

“Yes.” 

“What wakened you?’ 

“Nash and Kiirain.” 

He sighed: “I wish I'd been here.” 

She answered: “I'll wash up; we'll 
eat: and then off on the trail. I’ve 
an idea that the two will be back, and 
they'll have more men behind them.” 

As he finished his coffee he said, 
staring into a corner: “I don’t know 
why I came back to you, Sally.” 

“You didn’t mean to come back 
when you started?” 

“Of course not.” 3 

She flushed, and her heart beat 
loudly to hear his weakness. He was 
keeping nothing from her; he was 
thinking aloud; she felt that the barge 
between them were down again. 

“In the first place, I went because 
I had to be seen and known by name 
in some place far away from you. 
That was for your sake. In the sec- 
ond place, I had to be alone for the 
work that lay ahead.” 

“Drew ?” 

“Yes. It all worked like a charm. 
I went to the house of Jerry Wood. 
told him my name, stayed there until 
Conklin and several others arrived 
hunting for me, and then gave them 
the slip.” 

She did not look up from her occu- 
pation, which was the skilful cleaning 
of her gun. 

“The next thing. is Drew?” 

“Yes.” 

“There's no changing you.” She did 
not wait for his answer. “I know that. 
[ won’t ask questions. If it has to be 
done we'll do it quickly; and after- 
ward I can find a way out for us 
both.” 
| They saddled and took the trail 
which pointed up over the mountains 
——the same trail which they had rid- 
den in an opposite direction the night 
before. 

He rode with his head turned, tak- 
ing his last look at the old house of 
Drew, with its blackened, crumbling 
sides, when the girl cried _ softly: 
“What’s that? Look!” 

He stared in the direction of her 
pointing arm. They were almost di- 
rectly under the shoulder of rocks

which loomed above the trail along 
the edge of the lake. 3 

He caught the unmistakable glint 
of the morning light on steel, and he 
turned the gray sharply. At the same 
time a rattling blast of revolver shots 
crackled above them; the gray reared 
and pitched back. 

By inches he escaped the fall of 
the horse, slipping from the saddle 
in the nick of time. A bullet whipped 
his hat from his head. Then the 
aone of the girl clutched his shoul- 
er, 


“Stirrup and saddle, Anthony 

He seized the pommel of her sad- 
dle, hooked his foot into the stirrup 
which she abandoned to him, and she 
spurred back toward the old house. 

A shout followed them, a roar that 
ended in a harsh rattle of curses; 
they heard the spat of bullets sev- 
eral times on the trees past which 
they whirled. But it was only a sec- 
ond before they were once more in 
the shelter of the house. 

As for escape, there was simply no 
chance—it was impossible. On three 
sides the lake effectively blocked their 
way. On th fourth and narrowst 
side there’ was the shoulder of rocks, 
not only blocking them, but afford- 
ing a perfert shelter for Nash and his 


men, for they did not doubt that it 
was he. 

“They think they’ve got us,” said 
a fiercely exultant voice begide him, 
“but we ain’t started to make all the 
trouble we're goin’ to make.” 

For answer a bullet ripped through 
the right-hand wall and buried itself 
in a beam on the opposite of the 
room

Today's Short Story 
BY GEORGE T. BYE 
Itlustrated by Arlene Coyle 


The 1922 Children’s Party 


Long before the first limousine had 
rolled up with a girl or boy guest, Mrs. 
Hampden suggetsed frankly to her aged 
mother that she go to bed. 

“Tt will make you miserable for a 
mnth, ma, to sit up with these high 
school children,” she said, “and you 
know there’s no helping.it. It’s the 


new style of doing things. Now do go 
upstairs, ma, and try not to worry.” 


Jeanette Hampden sighed a sigh of 


luxurious relief, while repowdering her 
plump 15-year-old shoulders, as she 


heard her grandmother go to her room. 

“Bing” Bingley was the first to ar- 
rive. Even before he had taken off his 
overcoat, he produced a silver flask 
and insisted that Jeanette have a little 
nip with him. 

“Isn’t that wonderful stuff!” he 
ejaculated. ‘“‘Ten-year-old cognac. A 
friend in Atlantic City sent father a 
half dozen bottles of it. We just go 
it today.” 

One by one, excepting for the Larri- 
more and Hennessy brothers and sis- 
ters, the girls and boys danced up the 
steps of the Hampden porte-cochere to 
greet Jeanette. Some of the boys were 
in dinner coats. All of the girls were 
radiantly bare about the arms and 
shoulders; and their flimsy little party 
skirts were as short, probably, as their 
ages warranted, yet the shortness had 
a deliberate audacity. 

“Hey, Bing, who was the charming 
black I saw you with at the Palace 
enfa ofiaw theater § Iast night ?

"Fess up?’ 


“Bing” shook his fist with a grin at 
“Red” Hennessy. “Well, I'll:say she 
was some doll—yes, no?’ he parried. 
“By the way, we ran into the English 
teacher, Miss Glegg, and a soul mate.” 

“Who'd she catch? She’s vamping 
everybody.in pants.’ 

“Why, old Schneider, the chemistry 
*prof.’ 

“No! 
kids.’ 

“Sure, but it was Schneider just the 
saine.”’ » 

The musical laughter of the girls 
was somewhat marred by the discord- 


He’s got a wife and three 


ant cackle of the changing voices of 


the boys. Mrs. Hampden stepped in, 
with a merry smile, to ask for just a 
little quiet, as her mother had gone to 
bed with a headache. 


All the boys had risen with conven- 
tional decorum when Mrs. Hampden 
appeared. “Sure thing, Mrs. Hampden 
assured Nate Larrimore. “I’ll muzzle 
the rowdies. Could I please have a 
four-finger glasses?) I managed to 
bring along some peach brandy and Ed 
like it to be sampled.” 

The brandy was generally sam- 
pled. Then there was dancing, the 
rugs having been rolled up, to the mu- 
sic of a phonograph. What with the 
dancimg and little tastes of cognac, 
brandy, gin and bourbon, everyone was 
soon so warm they walked out on the 


veranda. Then occurred the onigp 
unpleasantness of the evening. Dore 
thy Gravian flared up with protes 
“I don’t like the: way you're actin 
Nate,’ she cried. . 

However, in the excitement this ja 
gle was at once frgotten. After 19 
o’colck, Mrs. Hampden served tung 
fish salad and ice ceram. Then some 
more dancing. At 1 the limousines 
were rolling away with the happy, 
guests, 

Mrs. Hamden noticed a light in hes 
mother’s room and looked in . Grande 
or fully dressed, was reading the 

ible. .

Howard Theater—All week, Wallace Reid 
in ‘‘Rent Free,”’ and other screen features. 
“Margie.” 

(At the Atlanta.) . 

“Margie” is neither so good as its 
advance literature nor so bad as re- 
port had led us to expect, which 
made the opening at the Atlanta 
theater Thursday night rather a pleas- 
ant surprise. As a matter of fact 
with a little money expended in 
scenic investiture, a fondness for a 
darkened stage whenever the chorus 
appeared, obliterated, and a general 
strengthening of situations, “Margie” 
could be easily converted into real 
entertainment. 

It’s melodrama with music and the 
melodrama isn’t bad and the music is 
more than occasionally very, very 
good. The little seen of the chorus work 
after the electrician has done his best 
to blot out the work, revealed about 
a dozen girls, who looked better than 
the average road show coryphee and 
who didn’t sing any «orse. The chief 
difference was that they sang more 
seldom, with which no one should find 
fault in these days when choruses 
are to be seen and not heard. * 

But there was real music,. particu- 
larly when Olivia Mynfahwyn, which 
is presumably Welsh, was on _ the 
stage. Whatever her nationality is, 
Olivia, who sings the name part, sings 
like a nightingale. Her voice shows 
excellent culture and withal a liquid 
sweetness that is simply a gift. 

And there’s real comedy too when 
Elmer Coudy is on, and he’s on a 
good bit. Coudy works easily, re- 
freshingly, and convincingly, enunci- 
ates his songs perfectly, and gener- 
ally adds to the gaiety of the oc- 
casion, 

Fred Fear, a splendid old-timer, 
does a character part with finish.

Loew Vaudeville. 


(At the Grand.) 

“Toyland Frolics,” the feature of- 
fering on the vaudeville bill at 
Loew’s Grand theater for the last 
half of the week, proved a very 
delightful entertainment. The act 
is neatly and attractively presented 
by a company of three. It derives 
its title from character songs in 
doll costumeg offered by two of the 
members of the company. Some 
very excellent toe dancing and vio- 
lin selections add to the appealing 
qualities of the offering. 

John Henshaw and Grace 
Avery, remembered for their many 
past appearances ?°n musical come- 
dy, give an example bordering on 
the old-time school vaudeville as 
it was presented in former days, 
and from the liberal applause given 
them by Thureday night’s audience, 
their style is fully as popular as 
that of the present day. 

Townsend, Wilbur and company 
have a pleasing one-act comedy, 
“The Smart Aleck,” that gets over 
in rapid-fire order. It is a “touch- 
and-go” skit that does not lag for 
a second and its dramatic minute 
or two, is so well blended that it 
only increases the interest. 

Jack Case, a blackface comedian, 
has a humorous collection of orig- 
inal stories and sings his songs 
well, and Hanlon and Clifton are 
two versatile chaps in dancing, 
singing and balancing feats. 

Heading the screen program is 
Corinne Griffith in “The Single 
Track.” 


Lew Cody. 


(At the Metropolitan.) 

Departing from the established 
precedent in his personal appearance 
engagement at the Metropolitan, 
Lew Cody is putting on a genuinely 
good act, one that could easily find 
a place in the big time vaudeville, 
and one, by that same token, that 
is going over with tremendous suc- 
cess. For more than fifteen min- 
utes he holds the audience fasci- 
nated with his art. Bert Lytell is 
pleasing cenerally in his latest of- 
fering; “The Idle Rich,” a produc- 
tion based on the Kenneth Harris 
oe Evening Post story, 
“Junk.”

interest. Nor require mob scenes to 
bolster up shortcomings in plot. 
There is eomething so sweet and 
wholesome and interesting in the 
story that the blase New Yorker, 
so particular and discriminating in 
his choice of theatrical entertain- 
ment, has seen fit to give it his 
steady patronage and unqualified 
enthusiasm ever since it wag first 
shown there in September, 1920. 


Lionel West. 


(At the Oriterion.) 

An all-round good show that Is 
ranking high in the esteem of At- 
lanta picture-going people is the 
bill at the Criterion this week with 
Lionel West in person and Lionel 
West in pictures, taking off the 
honors. Perhaps it’s because he is 
a native son that Lionel West is 
receiving so generous a reception, 
and perhaps it is partly because he 
proves his worthiness of Georgia 
so nobly by standing up gamely in 
his realistic bout with Jack Demp- 
sey. Besides appearing in person 
and making a brief and very sincere 
talk, Mr. West is shown as the 
heavy in “Dangerous Love,” a good 
western picture, in which a corking 
good fight is staged. 


U. §. Supplies Here 
Will Go on Block 
At Big Warehouse 


Between five and six million dollars 
worth of government supplies will be 
sold at auction from the Atlanta 
depot, .known locally as the Candler 
warehouse, on February 6, according 
to Major Talbot Smith, co-ordinator 


of the general supply for the 4th 
corps area. ; 

Disposition of supplies stored in 
the warehouse is peing made, said 
Major Smith, in keeping with the gov- 
ernment order that the warehouse be 
given up by June 30. 

Military supplies and equipment in 
quantities large enough to meet the 
needs of the national guards and re- 
serves is being stored up in ware- 
houses at Camp Jesup, as stated by 
Major Smith. 

A list of the stock to be offered 
for sale will be on hand at the 
Candler warehouse in the near future, 
it is suid. 

Lieutenant-Commander D. G. Mce- 
Ritchie, assistant co-ordinator, has

tion of surplus property in Alabama 
and Tennessee, which will be offered

thought then and now, he said, that 
if the army had detailed a squad to 
shoot a comrade it might have detailed 
another squad to pick up the body 
and bury it. 
. Abuse Alleged. 

Much testimony relating to alleged 
abuse of enlisted men cropped out 
again today, along with further refer- 
ence to the conduct of “Hard Boiled” 
Smith: T'wo former service men tes- 
tified they had seen three public exe- 
cutions at Is-Sur-Tille, at which sta- 
tion war department records showed 
only two men were hanged. 

The hearing was adjourned until 
next Wednesday.

and that it had affected his memory.

and statements asserted that the men

Ordinary Procedure. 

Ordinarily wage negotiations in the 
bituminous industry have been begun 
between an organization of operators 
in what is known as the central com- 
petitive field, including Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, Indiana and [llinois, and the 
union. The agreement reached in this 
orn agg ee —~! of — 
agreements in a © on ou 
districts. nS 


Certain of the Pennsylvania opera- 
tors have given notice that they would 
not renew the wage negotiations this 
year in association with other. sections 
of the central field, on the ground that 
West Virgin scales, chiefly non- 
union, were the hie? competitive fac- 


erators to meet with Presid

| Forecaster C. F. 
von Herrmann intimated that a cold 
draft of air from the northwest would 
reach Atlanta, changing the moist 
and warm weather to a more clear and 
cold one. 7 

Although the temperature for Fri- 
day morning was slated to be around 
25 degrees, according to the govern- 
ment weather bureau forecast, at mid- 
night Thursday night no change in 

wea was noticed. 

As stated in a press dispatch, a cold 
wave bearing snow swept eastward 
from the Rocky mountains Thursday, 
resulting in the coldest weather known 
in the northwestern states since 1909. 
In many of the western states the 
temperature is said to be below freez- 
ing. More moderate temperatures 
were recorded at the southern sta- 
tions, the weather bureau reported. 


Sterm in Chattanooga. 

Chattanooga, Tenn., January 19.— 
A typical spring storm swept over this , 
section at an early hour this morning, 
bringing the total precipitation for the 
past twenty-four hours to 2:30 inches 
and causing the smaller streams to 
overflow. The Tennessee river has 
reached a stage of 13 feet, with a pre- 
diction that it will go to 17 feet by 
Saturday.

negotiation with the employers, This 
position has remained unchanged, al-

war and the death of a million and a 
half Frenchmen. The premier took 
notice of these accusations, saying: 

“IT have been accused of being re- 
sponsible for the war; the war broke 
eut in spite of the French govern- 
ment.” 

At this point. great applause inter- 
rupted him momentarily; then, point- 
ing to M. Cachin, he continued: 

“T should execrate myself and never 
dare to appear before the chamber 
were there a shadow of truth in that 
statement. But once war became. in- 
evitable I had no other thought than 
victory.” 

Alluding to reparations, he said: 
“With the strictest economies and the 
heaviest taxation, we can not live un- 
legs Germany pays us. Every question 
of internal politics must be subor-. 
dinated to our foreign policy. We have 
peace abroad; let us have peace at 
home. 

German Ability to Pay. 

“T neither defend nor criticise the 
Versailles treaty, but I want its in- 
tegral execution.” is 

Discussing Germany’s ability to pay, 
the premier said: 

“Her corporations return enormous 
dividends, her factories are in full ac- 
tivity. In a word, her economic 
strength grows every day, and if the 
state itself is in ruins, the nation en- 
riches itself. It was in the name of 
the German nation that the Versailles 
treaty was aacepted. 

“France, in defending her rights, 
defends international accords, and fol-| 
lows in no way the suggestion of self- 
ishness. France wishes to see Europe 
and the whole world recovered from 
the painful unrest from which they 
suffer, but general economic reorgan- 
ization depends first upon the resto- 
ration of the devastated regions. 

Key Problem. 


“The reparations problem is the key 
to all others, and if Germany fails 
to keep her engagements it will be 


necessary to consider, after seeking the } | 


advice of the reparations commission, 
what measures to adopt. The first 
will certainly be necessary guarantees 
for the establishment of efficient con- 
trol over the budget, the remission of 
per and exportation. 

ton the other hand, so long as oth- 
er conditions of the Versailles treaty, 
such as disarmament and the punish- 
ment of war criminals, are not tul- 
filled, we will be compelled to keep in 
operation the penalties provided, and, 
if necessary, take others.” 

War Crimes. 


With reference to those guilty of 
war crimes, the premier asserted he 
would establish that there was a con- 
spiracy between the imperial German 
high staff and the great financial in- 
stitutions to put the French mines, 
the spinning and weaying mills and | 
the chemical factories beyond the pos- 
sibility of operating. 

In closing a vigorous speech, he 
alluded’ to the accusation that he was 
responsible for the non-disarmament 
of Germany, because, being premier, 
he held the power of making treaties. 

“You will look in vain at the peace 
treaty for my signature,” he explained, 
“but what was omitted then can be 
done now.”

half-forgotten days. 

It was not without reason that 
someone, who is an authority on col- 
lege glee clubs, called the Emory 
songsters the “sweetest singers in 
the south.” Unlike many oraniza- 
tions of its kind, the Emory Glee club 
places the emphasis on the quality of 
the voices of its personnel. 

Those that come to the perfarmance 
to be given at the Wesley Memorial 
church at 8 o’clock Friday night ready 
for a round of merriment, will not 
be disappointed, however. The Emory 
club is a living proof of the saying 
that “it’s always fair weather when 

ellows get together.” Under 
the auspices of the University Y. 
M. ©. A., a stunt night performance 
was put on at Emory, and the best 
skits, which appeared on the boards 
at that time, were chosen for the 
1922 glee club.

humorous acts on the program, was

ed a burlesque on the modern court- 
room which was so true to life yet so 
laughable. Hollis Pemberton. a student 
of promise in the Lamar School of 
Law, figures prominently in this skit. 

A remarkable aggregation of voices 
make up the chorus, which is the 
backbone of the club. Many of the 
singers have been trained in group 
singing for years, and some have ex- 
perienced the glare and glamor of the 
footlights in vaudeville and chau- 
tauqua performances, Dr. Malcolm H. 
Dewey, musical director, has devoted 
much time in training the chorus, so 
that it is said to be one of the best 
in the south. 

Among the soloists, who appear on 
the program, are Byron Warner, who 
gave the solo “Silent Night” in the 
community Christmas celebration at 
the Auditorium on December 25, and 
J. Foster Barnes, who has received 
several offers from grand opera com- 
panies and who is said to have sung 
in the French opera “Thais.” 

Recentl® the club returned from a 
tour of points in south Georgia and 
Florida, on which trip the club cov- 
ered over two thousand miles, sing- 
ing at Waycross, Valdosta, Brunswick 
and points below the Florida line. 

Tickets for this evening’s perform- 
ance are on sale at the Cable Piano 
company and Wesley Memorial 
church. 


HELD UP AND ROBBED 
OF HIS PAY ENVELOPE 


Milton Bounds, his pay envelope 
tucked snugly in his inside coat pock- 
et, was confronted by three men who 
held up and robbed him of $100 about 


10:30 o’clock Thursaay night, shortly 
after he had stepped off of the River 
car near Gertrude place. 

The men, said Bounds, drove up in 
a disreputable looking car and parked 
in a lonely part of the road. Two of 
them kept pistols pointed at him, 
while the third robbed him: 

After the holdup Bounds said the 
men drove off in the car in the direc- 
tion of the city. The automobile bore 
no license number and no tail light. 
In the darkness the appearance of 
the men could not be discerned so as 
to furnish any description to the po- 
ice. 


ORGANIZED GANG 
ROBBING SCHOOLS, 
DECLARE POLICE 


Steps were, being taken Thursday by 
local police to break up a gang of or- 
ganized thieves, to whose operations» 
the burglary of seven schools recently 
is laid. 

The latest school to be victimized 
was the Slaton school, which was 
broken open Wednesday night and a 
Victrola, a number 6f records and nu- 
merous text books stolen. In all six 
schools robbed a Victrola was each 
time among the list of articles stolen. 

Among the schools previously looted 
were the Fraser Street school, Georgia 
Avenue school, Ira and ‘Fair Street 
schools, and the negro school op 
Mitchell street.

public has become thrifty and discrim-

He asserted that the reopening o

FEDERAL BONDED 
WAREHOUSES GROW 


Washington, January 19.—Figures 
skvwing the growth in federai bonded 
warehouses for storing of agricultural 
products have been compiled by the 


| department of agriculture for the in- 


formation of delegates to the national 
agricultural conference, which meets 
here next Monday. Federal warehous- 
ing is expected to be considered by 
the conference in connection with its 
duty of marketing. 

The figures as compiled and made 
public today show that under the fed- 
eral warehouse act, one of the laws re- 
cently put on the statute books, the 
department has licensed 277 cotton 
warehouses with a capacity of 1,200,- 
000 bales; 276 grain warehouses with 
a capacity of 14,000,000 bushels; 18 
wool warehouses with a capacity of | 
about one-seventh of the annual wool 
clip of the country, and five tobacco 
warehouses. 

Declaring the movement has receiv- 
ed a great impetus in the last year, 
officials said that an application was 
pending from a big cotton warehouse 
in New Bedford, Mass., with a ca- 
pacity of over 100,000 bales, to come 
in under the federal act. This was 
said to be the first one received from 
the cotton mill section of New Eng- 
land. Others there, however, have 
approached the department for infor- 
mation on requirements of the federal 
law, it was said. 

Officials of the department believe 
that absence of federal grades for to- 
bacco has been responsible for only 
five tobacco warehouses so far com- 
plying under the federal law, The de- 
partment is now working on tenta- 
tive tobacco grades, and when this 
work is completed it is the opinion of 
those doing the work that the tobacco 
industry will join the cotton, grain 
and wool interests in seeking benefits 
of the warehouse act.

Moreover, department of agriculture 
reports current today indicated thar 
European countries might be expected 
to continue buying wheat freely in the 
world’s markets, and there were pre- 
dictions that a new decrease in the 
United States visible supply would be 
announced on Monday. Colder weath- 
er, tuo, counted as a stimulating fac- 
tor, much of the winter crop being 
without adequate snow protection, es- 
pecially in Kansas. Under such cir- 
cumstances no important setback in 
prices took place, and the finish was 
at nearly the fep level of the day. 

Corn and oats went higher withe 
wheat. Exporters continued § afte?

mates of farm reserves of corn were

off to 8.21 into new low ground for the

ing to cover hedges. The close was un-

The raw sugar futures market was !rregu-

an indication of the faith which investors have in the south as a field 


for investment. 

These bonds were offered through J. P. Morgan & Co., Tuesday 
morning, but so quickly were they gobbled up that the subscription 
books were immediately closed with the announcement that the issue 
had been largely oversubscribed. | 

3 From the proceeds of the bonds, the Southern Railway company 
‘wilt be able to take care of the $22,000,000 of short term notes it has 
falling due, a debt of something over $2,000,000 to the War Finance 
corporation for funds advanced during the period of federal control, 
and all of its floating debt. . 

This will leave the Southern Railway company’s heals in the 
easiest position it has known in years with no large maturities in the 
near future. The device of making the four per cent bonds market- 
able by simply adding a promise to pay an additional two and a half 
per cent proved an entire success and bond men were of the opinion 
this is one of the shrewdest moves recorded in years. It is pointed 
out that the Southern still has in its treasury some fifty million dollars 
of these bonds, covering impfovements made out of earnings in the 
past, which bonds can now he marketed as funds for improvements 


are needed. 

The net operating income of the Southern railway during Novem- 
ber was the largest in years, according to reports just issued to the 
interstate commerce commission. Net for that period totaled $2,366,608, 
as compared with $368,037 in November, 1920, $965,981 during the 
same month in 1919 and $906,405 in November, 1918, 


‘These figures brought net operdting income for eleven months 
ending November 30 up to $12,165,834, as compared with $14,538,711 
during the previous corresponding period, $8,918,114 the same period 
two years ago and $27,079,994 the corresponding period in 1918. Novem- 
ber gross of the road was more than $11,159,000—largest in the last 
three years, except in 1920, when the total was more than $12,683,000. 
Gross for the eleven months was in excess of $118,210,000.

New York, January 19.—For the 
first time in a week the stock market 
today indicated an excess of offerings 
over demand, the list recording ir- 
regular or uneven changes throughogt 
the active session. 

Lacking more definite reasons, the 
market's reversal was popularly at- 
tributed to the firmer tone of money. 
Call loans opened at 4 1-2 per cent, 
rising to 5 per cent at midday, with 
a 6 per cent rate in the final half 
hour, 

The only stocks to hold or enhance 
recent gains were specialties dominat- 
ed by professionals and other shares 
in which the floating supply is believed 
to be small as to make them readil 
available for speculative urposes. 
These groups again embra the in- 
de endent steels, minor equi nts, 
utilities and sugars, where further ex- 
treme advances of 2 to 8 points were 


made, 

_ Gulf States Steel was in a class by 
itself, adding almost 20 points to its 
steady upward movement and closing 
at 82, a net gain of 16 5-8 points. 
This represents an advance of $1

announced today. The bureau

at 149 in those two months, with th

Foodstuffs, farm products, clo

Metals and house furnishing

per cent, and then advanced to 6. 
Part of this was due to withdrawals 
of balances by out of town banks, 
part to government withdrawals and 
part to new financing. J. P. Morgan 
& Oo. announced today that subscrib- 
ers to the $30,000,000 Southern Rail- 
way bonds who asked for $100,000 or 
more would only get 20 per cent, and 
those asking for more only 10 per 
cent. This financing was ‘not a great 
deal in itself, but it was enough to 
make a difference. And then, too, 
some more new finaicing is being ar- 
ranged and the bankers interested are 
not sorry to see money look a little 
higher. 

Associated Dry Goods, which was 
strong today, earned $10 a share for 
its stock last year, it is understood, 
and is figuring on paying 6 per cent

Comment on Advertisement. 


-| A solid page advertisement today by 

the Corn Exchange bank is attract- 
ing considerable talk.| Every man at 
the head of a company issuing.zeports 
to shareholders and every banker 
should send and get a copy of this 
; advertisement. 

A large part of the existing con- 
ditions in general trade is due to lack 
of confidence and the business man 
or banker who is worthy of confi- 
dence and lets his customers Know 
about it is going to get his share of 
more of business. 

The Corn. Exchange has broken 
away from the ordinary bank state- 
ment by publishing under each item 
in the balance sheet a detailed ex- 
planation of what the item means, In 
this way the d itor can see for him- 
self just how his money is sécured. 

The statement as published shows 
plainly how assets more than enough 
to cover deposits can be turned into 
cash immediately if necessary to pay 
of all deposits. That is important in 
these times. Wall street banks and 
stock exchange houses have always 
gone on the theory that advertising 
o y to misrepresentation. 
It is the other way round. Such ad- 
vertising as the Corn Exchange is do- 
ing is protective.

decline in cotton was followed by 


vate ginning figures and covering by 
shorts. After selling up from 17.44 
to 17.87, or 23 points net higher, the 
market became less active and there 


realizing, with March closing at 17.77. 
The general market closed steady at 
a net advance of 2 to 13 points. 


The market opened steady at anj|- 
advance of 2 points on December, but 
generally 6 to 11 points lower, owing 
to weak Liverpool cables and unfav- 
orable reports from the cotton goods 
trade, where buyers were said to be 
holding off for a possible revision in 
prices. There was some _ scattered 
southern selling as well as further 
liquidation, and active months soon 
showed net losses of 16 to 20 points 
with January selling at 17.50 and 
May at 17.10. 

Offerings became lighter as soon 
as the initial selling orders had been 
executed, however, and the market 
firmed up during the middle of the 
morning on the continued better char- 
acter of the spot news from the south. 
The buying was stimulated later by 
reports that private ginning returns 
indicated’ only 7,904,000 bales ginned 
up to January 16, or 20,000 bales for 
the last period. 

Brokers who were credited with 
selling heavily for western and Wall 
street accounts earlier in the week 
were active buyers on the midday ad- 
vance, which carried gg up to 
17.85 and May to 17.52, or 19 to 24

At this time it does not look as though 
the selling meant anything more than
