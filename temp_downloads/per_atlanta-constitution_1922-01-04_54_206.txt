“ (United News Staff 


Correspondent. 
Washington, January 3.—The rep-| FAVORS $75,000,000 


resentatives of the Chita government 


that the Japanese are secretly plot-: 
ting to dominate eastern Siberia, in| 


-of Siberia have made fresh charges 


the face of unequivocal Japanese de-' 

nials. 

The new accusations are clioateiat | 
by what purports to be a copy of a 
treaty negotiated between the Japa-. 
nese and the anti-bolshevist generals, 
led by Semenov. ‘The alleged treaty ' 
sets forth that the Japanese are to; 

' provide the Semenov forces with’ 

‘money and arms and ammunition, in 

return for which the Japanese would 

be granted special privileges in Sibe- 
ria. 

The document proves, the Siberians 
declare, that the Japanese are en- 

. deavoring to establish a government 

“jn the Far Eastern republic which 

they would virtually control. It shows 

as well, they charge, that the Japa- 

nese deliberately are preventing the 

re-establishment of peace in Siberia. 
Kato Flatly Denies. 

Admiral Baron Kato, of the Japa- 
nese delegation, flatly denied the ex- 
istence of such a treaty, at the same 
time reiterating denials that France 
and Japan had an junderstanding with 
regard to mutual support in Russia. 

“The documents are absolutely 
false,’ said Kato, adding that he had 
been a member of the cabinet for the 

@ past seven years, and would have 
? known if treaties had been made. 

Kato went on to explain the Japa- 
nese policy in Siberia, which is of} 
interest because of the certainty that 
Japan's failure to withdraw her troops 
from Siberia will. be aired before the 
arms conference. The withdrawal was 

a provided in the agreement . made 
among the United States, Japan, Great 

Britain and France in 1918, when 

allied troops had been sent into Si- 

beria. 
On Troop Withdrawal, 

Kato said the Japanese troops 
would be withdrawn when guarantees 
aresreceived. that Russian .orces will 
me menace’ Koréa ‘or © Manchuria. 
G/aranties with regard to the pro- 
te tion of Japanese nationals and 
properties might ilso be asked, he 
said, if they were deemed necessary. 
Kato stressed the statement that the 
Japanese had no desire to interfere 
with the domestic policies of Siberia 
in any way. 

The Siberians assert that the original 
of the Semenov-Japanese treaty is in 
the archives of the ministry of foreign 
affai It is dated June 8, 1921, and 
related principally to the. military 
operations each signatory was to un- 
dertake. 

The Japanese, according to the doc- 
“*Sument, were to pay 500,000 yen, de- 
liver military’ supplies and aid in 
‘transport. 

One paragraph says: ‘When a sta- 
ble governmental authority is estab- 
lished in the Far East, Japanese sub- 
jects shall receive preferential rights

ISSUE OF ROAD BONDS 


Holder and Hardwick Ex- 
press Hope That Public 
Will Speedily Realize 
Importance of Project. 


_— 


Pledging his “superbest” efforts to 
help place Georgia in the forefront of 
states in road construction and main- 
tenance, John N. Holder, new chair- 
man of the state highway commis- 
sion, in a speech delivered at a lunch- 
eon tendered him Tuesday’ by 
Charles J. Haden, declared that he 
will devote his entire time and, dedi- 
cate his life to his new field of work. 

In his first public address since 
his appointment Mr. Holder said the 
chief function of the highway depart- 
ment in the next year will be in 
maintaining present highways. He 
strongly recommended passage of the 


$75,000,000, but warned that it 
should be submitted to ‘the people at 
the proper time, asserting that such a 
proposal probably would be defeated 
if placed before the people for rati- 
fication at the present time. Mr. 
Holder also made the recommendation 
that the University of Georgia es- 
tablish a short course in road main- 
tenance so that men needed for such 
service in various counties in Geor- 
gia can be given proper training. 
Haden Presides. 

Mr. Haden, who tendered the lurch- 
eon to Mr: Holder, presided as chair- 
man. In addition to Mr. Holder, the 
chairman presented Governor Thom- 
as W. Hardwick and W. R. Neel, 
state highway engineer, as other prin- 
cipal speakers. In presenting Mr. 
Holder, Chairman’ Haden declared 
that no matter how people may dif- 
fer on Governor Hardwick's policies, 
the governor’s appointment of Mr, 
Holder as chairman of the state high- 
way board had met with virtually uni- 
versal approval. 

Beginning his speech, Mr. Holder 
referred to the good work done in be- 
half of good roads by Mr. Haden 
when he served as president of the 
Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He 
also complimented Atlanta newspapers 
on their continual aid and help, point- 
ing out the work of The Constitu- 
tien and The Journal in fostering 
good roads tours many. years ago. 


© Outlines Task. 


Briefly outlining the task of the 
highway department in taking over 
maintenance of the first 1,500 miles 
of the proposed state trunk line sys- 
tem of 5,500 miles, Mr. Holder said 
a bond isste will expedite, to a-mark- 
ed extent, future road construction. 
He said three-sevenths of the trunk 
line system is composed_of interstate 
highways, and. four-sevenths of inter- 
county highways. He-said 60 per 
cent of the money available will be 
spent on maintenance of the interstate 
systems and 40 per cent on the inter- 
eounty units. 

While expressing doubt as to the 
passage of a bond issue. at this time, 
Mr. Holder said he had sincere hopes 
that by the time the legislature meets 
this summer tlre people will be in a

checks had been drawn on the Mer-

McDowell, but it was also discovered 
that the signature was not that of the 
real estate dealer. He was questioned 
and it was determined that he had not 
drawn. the three checks. 

This story was brought to light: 

A well-dressed man presented a check 
at the City National bank for $850 
drawn by E. 8S. McDowell. The 
stranger. spoke to the teller and said: 

“You know me. My name.is Pat- 
rick, and I live near Griffin. I want 
to deposit five hundred of this and 
want the balance in cash.” 

And Then Disappeared.

story was told a teller at the Second 
National bank, and the story was re-

at the corner of West Hunter and

The flames ate their way from the 
front of the candy concern and soon 
enveloped and completely gutted the 
structure. For some time the Metz- 
ger Mattress company, occupying a 
three-story building adjoining 
Wiley company, was seriously threat- 
ened, but heroic work: on the part 


of the firemen and the presence of 
an excellent fire wall probably saved 
the latter concern.

Southern Cities Involved: 
in Deal,’ 


| Hine 


New. York, January 3.——A plan off 
new financing by the newly organized 
National Power and Light ¢ompany, 
intended to rehabilitate frolley and 
electric light concerns in 8ix southern 
cities controlled by the American 
Cities company, and end réceiverships 
for three of them, was announced 
today. 

Absorption by the new organization 
of the controlling company’s five and 
six per cent collateral trust bonds, on 


which there had been defayit' two 
years ago, is a feature of the plan. 


Three of the companies affected and 
which are now in receivership are the 
Birmingham Railway, Light and Pow- 
er company, Memphis Street Kailway 
company and New Wrieans Kailway. 
and Light company. It was agreed 
by the committee of the -- American 
Cities company, which decided on the 
plan that the affairs of the New Or- 
leans company should be left in con- 
trol of the Chase National Bank of 
New York. 

The other companies involved in the 
refinancing are the Houston. Lighting 
and Power company, Knoxville Kail- 
way and Light company and Little 
Rock Railway and Blectric company.

Railway, Light and Power company, 
Lee C. Bradley. receiver, stated to- 
night regarding the organization of 
the National Power and Light com- 
pany .to take over the properties of 
the American Cities company. 

Consummation of the deal has been 
expected for some time, according to 
Mr. Bradley, following an examination 
of the properties by agents of the 
Electric Bond and Share company. 
The approximate valuation of the Bir- 
mingham utilities controlled by the 
American Cities company is placed at 
$22,500,000.

New Orleans, January 3.—No av-

Entire Section Threatened. 

The mattress company's building 
contained a large amount of highly 
inflammable material, and firemen 
said that if it caught the entire sec- 
tion beyond the Terminal station 
would be threatened. 

The building occupied by.the Wiley 
company, it is said, is owned by Carl 
Witt, but Mr. Witt was not accessible 
and no statement was available as to 
its value. The building of the mat- 
tress company is a stone structure. 

When the first alarm was sound- 
ed, four fire’ companies rushed to 
the Wiley candy factory, where the 
flames had gained full headway in the 
three-stoty brick building. Soon a 
dozen or. more nozzles were spouting a

At 2 o’clock the Wiley factory WAS 
practically eonsumed, only the outer 
shell of. the. walls remaining. At this 
point the fire department turned most 
of its attention to the mattress build- 
ing. 

Emergency Call. 

Some time earlier an emergency call 
for all available equipment and men 
had been issued by Fire Chief*Cody, 
and the central companies were on 
hand in force engaged in fighting the 
fire stubbornly. 

Six hundred bales of cotton, used 
for stuffing mattresses, were stored 
in the Metzger company’s building in 
addition to extensive-equipment. This 
building was constructed of stone. 

The Wiley company is one of the 
oldest in the candy business in the 
south and is widely known in busi- 
ness circles. ‘The mattress company 
is also an important manufacturing 
concern of the city. 


BAREFOOT ROBBER 
BELIEVED CAUGHI 


A. P. Chandler, Arrested 
in Marietta, Suspected of 
Having Had Hand in Se- 
ries of Odd ewes 


ia the capture Tuesday afternoon 
by City Detective E. M. Cason, of A. 
P. Chandler, 37 years old, of Marietta, 
Ga., a manhunt which has been main- 
tained for several months was ended, 
and the man, known in criminal cir- 
cles as “the farefoct. burglar,” was 
in the toils of the law, officers said. 

Captured in 1916 and charged with 
participation in’ more than 10v in- 
dividual cases of burglary, this “bare- 
foot burglar” was sentenced to twenty 
years“in the state penitentiary. 

Because of good behavior, he was 
paroled, reports stated, in June, 1921, 
and given liberty. It was not long, 
however, before suspicion was again 
directed at him because of the nature 
of a number of burglaries which con- 
vinced police that “the barefoot 
burglar” was again at work. 

He is suspected, detectives stated, of 
a number of recent burglaries in the 
North Side section and efforts are 
being made following his arrest Tues- 
day to defnitely prove his connection. 
with several which-so far have re- 
mained mysteries. 

The operations of the “barefoot 
burglar” are said to be unique. He 
is said to remove his shoes and stock- 
ings prior to entering a home, never 
to carry a revolver or other weapon 
with which to defend himself, and to 
have a passion for money. It is said 
that he has been known to. overlook 
articles. valued at hundreds, and even 
thousands of dollars, in his search for 
money. 


burglarizing the home of 8S. 8. Dean, 
1630 ce de Leon avenue. When 
last week the home was mage gn 
ed robbed, the manner in which the 

burglary was performed contained all 
the earmarks of “the barefoot burglar” 
and Detective Cason was detailed to 
hunt for the man until he got him.

{umns. The latest is a tragedy of a | 
customs official, sent to “guard” the] 


liquor stock of an Italian ship. He 
came ashore drunk, with a companion, 
also drunk. They went to a saloon 
in the Bronx and demanded more 
drink. The bartender refused and the 
trusted customs official shot him 
through the head. He woke up in a 
cell Tuesday afternoon and wondered 
why he was there. 
Woman Found Dead 

A woman was found dead in a sub- 
way station. Beside he» was an emp- 
ty bottle labeled “Gin.” A shoemak- 
er was found, blind and partially par- 
alyzed, on the steps of his home. He 
died, and analysis showed the cause— 
wood alcohol. 

An unidentified woman was tound 
in a hallway clutching an empty bot- 
tle. She and an unidentified man 
:picked up on the street will die, 

“T killed my wife on Christmas 
day,” said a Perth Amboy carpenter, 
walking into the police station. There 
had been a quarrel over drinking, then 
murder. The carpenter continued 
drinking until he “thought his wife 
was calling him,” and then gave him- 
self up. 

Prohibition enforcement agents are 
reported as “pleased”’ with the results 
of the holiday “prohibition,” and the 
assistant chief enforcement officer has 
been roundly. complimented by State 
Director Ralph ‘A. Day on his work. 

“This Is’ Result.” 

Meanwhile, 
able to trace the soufee of the liguor 1 
which may be deémed more or less 
“good,” are making strenuous ‘endeav- 
or to find the original purveyor of the 
gallons of wood alcohol ‘that went 
into Christmas and New Year's bot- 
tles. Probably they will never find 
the source, for those who drank it are 
dead and unable to tell where they 
bought it. 

“A great many amateur chemists,” 
said an official at prohibition head- 
quarters, “think they know how to 
restore denatured alcohol to its origi- 
nal non-poisonous quality. They 
don’t know how, and this is.the re- 
sult.”

LONDON NEWS 
POINTS MORAL. 

London, January 3.—In the tragic 
results of New Year's holiday celebra- 
tion and the deaths caused by drink- 


ning News reads a stern lesson for 
England. The lesson fs that the 
United Kingdom should not follow 
the prohibition iead of America. 

The News cites the long list of 
deaths as one of the horrors of prohi- 
bition, pointing out that all Ameri- 
cans, including girls who never drank 
before, now crave stimulants, 

“The knowledge of what happens 
when you forbid any normal] pleasure 
is as old ag the human race,” it says. 
“In the case of the United States, 
this evidence of human contrariness 
has been brought to the fore .under 
prohibition. Certainly nothing we 
have seen in the effects of prohibition 
in the United States offers any in- 
ducement to follow in the footsteps of 
America.”

Dublin, January. 3.—The dail

what it is hoped will be final action 
on the Irish treaty. At the close of 
the session the impression vhsivatied 
that ratification was certain, but that 
the majority would be small. 

Sinre the proceedings began the 
rule has been for speakers for and 
against the treaty to be heard alter- 
nately, and up to the present it has 
not been found necessary to break this 
rule, sw evenly is the parliament divid- 
ed, and it is probable that the rule 
will be followed to the end. The pace 
is quickening somewhat, however, for 
while four speakers occupied the en- 
tire morning, ten were heard in the 
afternoon, and there is some hope of 
the debate terminating Thursday or 
Friday, 

Frequent attempts are béing made 
to hasten the decision» either by limit- 
ing the length of the Speeches or by 
h cloture motion, but thus far the 
leaders on both sides have not been 
able to reach any agreement on the 
matter.

Summarizing the past two years’ 
work of the committee in a report at 
the session, Chairman Haunson stated 
that the committee has no indebted-

ury to turn over to the new commit- 
tee; that it has neved had a complaint 
for illegality, irregularity or fraud; 
that it has never had a runover elec-

dum on the ballot for reading of the 
Bible in the public schools; that it

‘Tariff Progress Slow. 

- Tariff revision has been in prog-

finance committee today seemed no 
hearer completion of the measure than 
it was last November. Hearings, fill- 
ing many volumes with testimony, 
have: been had, and are continuing, 
through many repititions of similar 
views. 

Meanwhile, there ie talk in the 
house of besinning once a “scien- 
tific’ tax revision, to supplement the 
“temporary” tax bill passed recently. 
Many congressmen, who want to con-

Washington, \ January 3.— The 
American proposal to prohibit use of 
submarines against merchant vessels, 
now the predominant issue of the 
arms negotiations, has been accepted 
in principle by France, but her dele- 
gaies have yeserved final approval 


language of the declaration. 

British acceptance previously has 
been given, and although neither the 
Italians nor the Japanese had re- 
ceived final instructions tonight, 
there were indications that neither 
Rome or Tokio would interpose seri- 
ous objection if the proposal received 
France’s full approval. 

The exact nature of the French 
reservation was not revealed, but the 
impression was gathered in some 
quarters that it might concery such 
a2 definition of the terms of the decla- 
ration as would make it clear just 
what conduct would be expected from 
merchantmen in view of their immu- 
nity from usbmarine attack. 

Definition of Term. 

Should that point be raised an in- 
teresting and many-sided discussion 
might arise, for, in several quarters, 
there has been apparent a tendency 
toward the opinion that the term 
‘*merchant ships” would be strictly 
defined with express stipulations as 
to whether merehantmen are to be 
permitted to arm and whether it ig 
to be permissible to disguise warships 
as vessels of commerce. — 

The French delegation, however, in 
j mating known their acceptance 
principle 
hot ofily agree to the original pro- 
posal of Elihe Root that the new 
prolibition én submarine warfare be- 
come effectite when all nations have 
agreed to it,, but also to th amend- 
ment. of Arthur J. Balfour, which 
would make the prohibition immedi- 
ately effective as between the five 
great powers. 

At the same time the French have 
acceptéd the additional Root declara- 
tion under which any submarine conm- 
meander violating the rules of interna- 
tional law would be liable to tria! 
for an act of piracy. In regard to 
this also acceptances still are awaited 
from the other foreign governments. 
Jt is possible the delegates’ instruc- 
tion will be sufficiently complete, 
however, to permit a meeting of the 
naval committee of the whole tomor- 
row.

egations, was approached personally 
_ by the Chinese re tatives, and in 
some quarters definite results are ex- 
pected within a few days. 

Following the example of the Amer- 
ieans, the British up indicated that 
it will have no objection to the Japa- 
nese proposal to clarify further the 
‘scope of the new four-power Pacific 
treaty, so that it will not apply to the 
principal islands of the Japanese em- 
pire. A definite declaration on the 
subject, to be approved by the four 
signatory powers, is understood to be 
in preparation. 

Su 

‘ Meantime, work on two important 
collateral futures of the conference, 
involving technical details of the naval 
statement and revisions of the Chinese 
tariff system, moved forward in sub- 
committees with a promise of early 
vonelusion, The naval experts sub- 
committee spent all day clearing away 
the remaining loose ends of the naval 
agreement, and the tariff subcommit- 
tee is understood at a session late in 
the day to have reached a virtual de- 
sion regarding the readjustment of 
China’s tariff schedule. ; 

Beforé the meeting of the tariff 
body, its chairman, Senator Under- 
wood, of the American delegation, con- 
ferred at length with Albert Sar- 
raut, head of the French group, and 
they are said to have discussed the 
particular interest of France in the 
new Chinese fiscal arrangement, aris- 
ing out of conditions along the border 
of French Indo-Chffa. The entire sub- 
ject of the open door is understood 
to have been reviewed by the two 
delegates, with the result that the 
work of the subcommittee was facili- 
tiated materially. 

While the arms delegates were giv- 
ing their first attention to these sub- 
jects, they also were taking some note 
of developments on the fringe of the

with it. 
Harvey’s Instructions. - 

- It was said at the white house that 
Ambassador Harvey had not been in- 
structed to raise the submarine issue 
at the Cannes conference, but there 
were indications that if it should be 
brought forward by some other power 
he would be in a position to discuss it. 

In discussing tonight the French ac- 
ceptance of the submarine restrictions 
Mr. Sarraut declared that his govern- 
ment, accepts frankly not only the 
Root resolutions, but Mr. Balfour's 
proposal in respect to the second one. 

Asked if it would be necessary “‘to 
discuss the resolutions,” he said: 

“We accept fully the spirit of the 
resolutions, which includes also the 
spirit of the second one with Mr. Bal- 
four’s addition. The naval experts 
will give the resolutions a precise form 
so that there may be a clear under- 
standing of them.” 

, Many Problems Kaised. 

‘Previously strong misgivings ap- 
peared to have arisen in the minds of 
various delegates as to the prudence 
of accepting Mr. Balfour’s suestion 
that the submarine prohibition be ac- 
cepted now by the five powers. With- 
out waiting for the’‘universal consent” 
which Mr. Root said was necessary to 
make a fresh addition to internatiorfal 
law, naval people were said to be 
thinking of the need for clear and even 
elaborate definitions of the meaning 
of the resolution and the naval ques- 
tions opened up by it. ‘The resolution 
provides that submarines shall not be 
used as commerce destroyers under 
any circumstance. Some of the ques- 
tions raised are these: 

“If submarines may not attack car- 
riers, may they be attacked by capital 
ships or lighter sea surface warships 
or by airplanes or by mines or by 
any device employed other than by 
submarines? 

“Are merchant ships free to-run 
down and attack submarines or can 
they be converted into auxiliary naval 
craft having all the appearance of 
merchant ships, although really armed, 
or can merchant ships employed to 
lay mines be attacked by submarines? 

“If capital ships may bombard open 
towns thereby endangering the lives of

Italian Delay. 

it was said tonight, however, that 
members of the French delegation, 
while they have their views on this 
question, are not disposed to press 
them upon the attention of the confer- 
ence, but to let other delegations in- 
vite the British and Americans clar-

The Italian reply on the Koot reso- 
lutions is said to have been delayed 
because the Italian government, be- 
ing entirely absorbed by important 
questions, such as the crisis of the 
Banca Italiana di Sconto and the 
meeting at Cannes, has not yet thor- 
oughly examined the situation. ‘The 
Italian delegation has supplied Kome 
with minute explanations and inter- 
pretations of the' resolution and its 
amendment. 

What immediate steps may be taken 
as a result of the proposed interces- 
sion of Secretary Hughes and Mr. Bal- 
four in the Shantung negotiations is 
not apparent, but the latest develop- 
ment seemed to revive hope of a set- 
tlement both among the Chinese and 
Japanese. ° 

As head of the Japanese delegation, 
Baron Kato took occasion to deny ca- 
bled repor™s that direct negotiations 
concerning the Shantung question had 
been inaugurated at Peking by the 
Japanese minister. He added that 
probably the report was based ‘upon 
the visit of courtesy which the Japa- 
nese minister at Pekin paid to new 
prime minister of China, on which oc- 
casion Baron Kato said. “he might 
have mentioned the Shantung ques- 
tion.” 


LEGISLATIVE JAM 
FACING CONGRESS 


(Continued From Page One.) 


this spring, legislation to handle labor 
controversies is about ready for con- 
gress. The legislation, as yet, can- 
not be said to be a part of the Harding 
program, although eventually there is 
no doubt the president will give it his 
support. 

The president is informed on what 
has developed, he and members of his 
cabinet and senators have discussed 
the plan to be advanced, and he is said 
to be in entire sympathy with the ef- 
fort to be made,

The proponents of the plan desire to 
get as far away from the idea of ar- 
bitration as possible. They desire to 
create a court where judgment can 
be rendered in all strikes wherein in- 
terstate commerce is involved. But, 
contrary to the idea given by the pres- 
ident on several recent occasions, the 
plan is not patterned after the Kansag 
industrial court in any yarticular. 

The bill provides for the creation 
of a court on which neither labor nor 
émployers will be represented as such. 
The court will be representative of 
the public interest only snd_ the 
judges are to be chosen without regard 
to their affiliation with any groups 
directly interested in or associated 
with the labor problem. The court is 
to make i‘: decisions on’ evidence sub- 
mitted. Public opinion will be called 
on to prevent strikes during the time 
cases are on trial. And the decisions 
will carry with. them no threat of en- 
forcement, other than the threat’ of 
public opinion. These are the fea- 
tures of the plan.

Atlanta Lions’ club, presented his 
resignation as president at the club’s 
regular meeting Tuesday afternoon in 
the Piedmont hotel. The board of di- 
rectors will nominate a new president 
and will call for an election at next 
Tuesday's meeting. 

Mr. Smith, who is a member of the 
realty firm of Smjth & Rankin, was 
elected president ofthe southern ais- 
trict of Lions’ clubs at the recent con- 
vention at Rome, Ga., and gave his 
new duties as the cause of his resig- 
nation. following his .-resignation 
speech, the club gave him a rising 
vote of appreciation for his services 
during bis presidency. : 

A feature of the meetifig was the 
address on “Human influence,” by 
Rev. Thomas H. Johnston, dean of 
St. Phillip’s cathedral. He declared 
“there are people in Atlanta who are 
exerting no more influence in inter- 
civic, religious and political affairs 
here than the old ‘Red Skin,’ who 
used to stand in front of cigar stores.” 
He appéaled to the members of the 
club to exert their influence for the 
good of Atlanta, and illustrated his 
point by referring to the achievements 
of individuals in past and modern 
times. He also appealed for brotherly 
love for the man who seems down 
and out or degenerate. 

Press Huddleston, chairman of the 
entertainment committee, announced 
that the Jax saxophone quartet will 
play at next Tuesday’s meeting, and 
introduced a resolution that the first 
Tuesday in February shall be visi- 
tors’ day. The resolution was adopted. 

The program committee announced 
Tuesday that Councilman Edgar Wat- 
kins will address the club next Tues- 
day. He will thoroughly discuss the 
new form of city government as pro- 
vided in the proposed new charter 
which he seeks in a resolution intro- 
duced in ‘council Monday night.

“I do not come from the class of 
the deputy from Dublin; I come from 
the plain people of Ireland. The lady 
whose name was mentioned is, I un- 
derstood, betrothed to some man. I 
know nothing of her personally in any 
way, but the statement might cause 
her pain, and it might eause pain to 
the lady who is betrothed to me. I 
will not allow to pass without chal- 
lenge, or allow any deputy in this as- 
sembly of my nation to insult any 
lady of this nation or any other na- 
tion.” 

Daniel O'Callaghan, lord mayor of 
Cork, who succeeded Terence Mac- 
Swiney after the latter’s death, de- 
plored the heat displayed on both sides 
replacing the harmonious relations in 
the dail eireann in the past. He pro- 
posed that the question of ratifying 
the treaty be left to a plebiscite. 

Lively interchanges followed a re- 
quest by Michael Collins to intervene 
in the debate, so that he might make 
a suggestion in the interest of har- 
mony. This was objected to by 
Countess Markievicz on the ground 
that it was out of order, which objec- 
tion was indorsed by the speaker. It 
led, however, to a formal motion that 
Mr. Collins be heard. This was car- 
ried without division.

however, left the situation no better

to have no division at all on the

through and permit a provisional gov- 
ernment. to be set up, after wiich 
they could carry on their fight for a 
republic. 
De Valera Unheard. 

“You can redeem the country in 

this way,” he said, “and take all kinds 


all the shame and discredit.” 

Eamon de Valera took issue with 
this suggestion; but was imperfectly 
heard in reply, and there were many 
different impressions of what he real- 
ly said. But in effect it amounted 
to a refusal and the declaration that 
he and his followers would continue 
fighting in any event. His own pro- 
posal, which would have facilitated an 
agreement, had been turned down, he 
declared, by the other side. .

frame of mind to look on the proposi-

“If we could issue bonds right now 
it would be the greatest thing that 
could happen to us,” he said. “We 
could put hundreds of mules and 
thousands of men to work and could 
build highways much cheaper than 
in the past and cheaper than they 
can be built in the future.” 

Mr. Holder said he will work in 
perfect harmony wtih the state high- 
way department. He called on the 
newspapers for co-operation and said 
the legislature and counties would 
be asked to give full co-operation. 
He asked all interests represented to

I felt that such a man was needed

The governor agreed with Mr. Hold-

to submit the question of a bond issue

“This proposition has my full and

1,300 miles of graded roads top-sur- 
faced, had been constructed in the 
last two years, and that $15,000,000 
‘was spent in road construction in 
last year. No such sum, he 


sdded, would be spent in a single year 
in the near future. .. 


Federal Aid Money. 
“Most of the large amount of money 
available last year had accumulated 


in the federal aid fund, and when 
provision finally was made to accept 
this aid, the fund covered several 
years’ appropriations,” he said. 

Mr. Neel pointed out the great need 
of amending the Georgia constitution 
so that it will be possible for Georgia 
to accept federal aid in the future, 

“Through the To amend- 
ment, the government hereafter will 
deal only with the state highway de- 
partments of the various states and by 
this method deal directly with the 
states and not with counties,” he said. 
“At present the highway department 
is simply the agent of counties. Sen- 
ator Watson obtained an amendment 


: to the federal highway laws which will 


grant Georgia and other states three 
years in which to revise their consti- 


sition to accept state aid money. Un- 
less this is done, future of road con- 
struction in Georgia is fraught with 
grave dangers.”

An Appreciation 


and a 


Suggestion 


With the passing of the year 1921 it affords us 
much pleasure to say that we have enjoyed a most 
satisfactory business; the best year in the history 


of our business. 


- 


This, of course, has been made possible by the 
continued patronage of our friends in Atlanta and 
throughout the South, some of whom we have never 
seen, but who are friends, just the same. 

We appreciate the steady support that has been 
given.us and that has made the year one of which 


we are proud. 


Our entire organization has worked very hard' to 
merit this patronage and assure you that we shall 
not relax in our efforts during the year just begin- 


ning. 


We shall continue to give you the bénefit of our 
long years of experience in the procuring of quality 
foods for you; our purchasing power; our conven- 
fently located store with goods properly displayed, 
and with increased facilities in the way of more tel- 
ephones and delivery trucks. 

Our suggestion is that you get full value in the 
purchase of foods by selecting only those of real 
FIRST QUALITY, from a store that is a model of 
sanitary perfection and cleanliness, and fully pro- 
tected by screening against contamination from the 


outside. 


Food products that are cheap in price are gener- 
ally most expensive and less palatable. They do not 
go as far, are not as nourishing, nor otherwise as 


satisfactory. 


WHATEVER YOUR FOOD, PLAIN 
‘OR FANCY, BUY WISELY AND SEE 
THAT THE QUALITY IS THERE.

Council Is Told 


Sims Says Committee Will 
Study Ocean Rates on 
!. “Kiddie Cars.” 


Aldermanic dignity was replaced by 
widespread grins, councilmanic sides 
shook with suppressed laughter, and 
the entire assemblage of city fathers 
in “official session at the opening of 
the year 1922, for a few seconds laid 
aside the staid and sober routine of 
business and rockéd with merriment 
when council’s committee on freight 
rates and transportation solemnly read 
its report for the past year’s activities. 

There was, however, not a smile on 
the face of a single committeeman. It 
was a serious business with them. They 
admitted that their report was one of 
“the most important submitted to 
council.” 

And small wonder. ‘ Had not freight 
rates and passenger fares throughout 
the nation been lowered and had not 
transportation 


Here’s The Report. 

But read the report for yourself. It’s 
self-explanatory. -Here it is: 

“Your committee on freight rates 
and transportation has had a most 
difficult situation to contend with 
during the past year. It faced an ab- 
normal condition occassioned by the 
war and its attendant evils of high 
rates and disturbed business relations. 

“The mayor, however, doubtless 
having in mind the difficulties of the 
situation, followed a long established 
precedent and used great care in the 
selection of your committee. Your 
committee felt keenly the honor done 
them and went about their duties mod- 
estly but with a deep feeling of re- 
sponsibility. 

“Unlike other council committees, 
whose duties are confined solely: to 
local affairs and are therefore more 
or less simplified, the work of this 


committee has to do largely with prob- 


7 


wiening beyond the confines 
of the city limits, therefore making its 
duties more complexed and its respon- 
sibilities gréater. 
: “Watchful Waiting.” 

“Noting with what signal success 
the policy of ‘watchful waiting’ has 
been met with in the relations of our 
national government with the siete 
republic to the south, your committee 
adopted this policy and ‘aré glad to 
say that their action has been ful 
vindicated by results. 
' “We are gratified to state that 
freight rates cad Pullman fares hate 
been reduced and that the national 


tax.on travel and trade has been re- 


moved. To these very eh nape rey tangi- 
ble results we ‘point with pride’. These 
results have been obtained 
the expenditure of a single dollar 
from the city treasury, and yet mean 
a saving of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to the citizens of Atlanta. We 
invite a comprison of these accomplish- 
ments with those of other committees 
which have done nothing but spend 
the people’s money. 

“We regret that we are unable to 
make so favorable a report on our 
local transportation problem. We at- 


without 


tribute the failure in a measure to 


the fact that we have not had the co- 
operation of the mayor as fully, in 
dealing with this matter, as he has 
rendered in regard to our more suc- 
cessful undertakings, We feel, how- 
ever, that notwithstanding this handi- 
cap, we are one year closer to a sat- 
isfactory solution of the problem than 
we were at the beginning of the year. 
In this thought we find some consola- 


tion.” 
Statement of Sims. 


Councilman J. N. Renfroe, chairman 
of the 1921 committee, appeared to be 
gratified at the selection of Council- 
man Walter Sims as his successor, de- 
claring that in his opinion, Mr. Sims 
knows more about freight rates than 
any other member of council save him- 
self. 

In assuming the reins of transporta- 
tion leadership, Councilman Sims de- 
claredghe will give his best éfforts to 
the important post during the year. 
He expressed confidence that national 
transportation rates can be further 
punished by the committee, and indi- 
eated that he and his colleagues will 
spend most of their time investigating 


linter-ocean rates on “kiddie-ears’” be- 


!

ee 


Siberian points. 
“The future of our fair city is deep- 
ty y concerned with this important mat- 
ter,” he said. “If the committee can 
solve this problem, “it will probably 
turn its attention to transportation 
nalties inflicted on prénes travel- 
ing between California points and At- 
lanta boarding house tables. . Further 


than this, I am not prepared just yet |: 
ly to discuss our future activities.”

expected to be run successfully if he

have the public against yon, you 
might as well quit. I am fofthe in-

The resolution was seconded by J. 
A. Campbell, newly-elected to the 
commission. The vote on the resolu- 
tion was three “nays’’—Commission- 
ers W. J. Dabney, C. E. Allen and 
Guy Webb, and twa. “yeas.” 
_ Pilcher’s Action. : 
It was immediately following the 
defeat of this resolution that City 
Manager Pilcher presented the fol- 
lowing written resignation: 
“Please accept this as my resigna- 
tion as city manfger of the town of 
Decatur, Ga., effective at the end 
of the first quarter of the year, 1922.” 
Then came the only acrimonious 
debate of the meeting. Commission- 
ers George and Campbell wanted a 
vote taken on accepting or refusing 
the resignation, whereupon Mr. Pil- 
cher declared that “when a man re- 
signs it is not necessary to vote on 
it. The city’s charter says that the 
city manager is not city manager by 
‘death, resignation or removal,’ When 
I resign, I resign, ~— I quit no mat-

motion to accept the manager’s resig- 
nation, there was no more opposition 
and the resignation was accepted. 
Relative to the cause of Mr. Pil- 
cher’s resignation the following let- 
ter written by him on November 2, 
1921, to W. J. Dabney, mayor of De-' 
catur, and chairman of the board of 
commissioners, is quoted: 
“I have decided to resign my posi- 
tion as city manager of Decatur about 
the first of the New Year, 1922. 
“This decision has not been reached 
because of any lack of cordiality be- 
tween your honorable board and my- |

political complications outside of the | gro 


board—which in my opinion will in- 
evitably hamper the ‘whole city gov- 
ernment for a long time to come.” 
Commissioners Sworn In. 
Prior to. the introduction of Com- 
missioner George's resolution, Judge 
J. R. George swore in Homer F. 
George, as commissioner re-elect for 
1922, and J. A. Campbell, commission- 
er-elect. ‘ 3 
Then Commissioner W. J. Dabney 
was re-elected mayor and chairman 


of the board of commissioners, and C. 
Eugene Allen was re-elected vice 
i of the 

To fill vacancies caused on the 
board of tax assessors by the re- 
moval of citizens from the town, 
James A. Campbell and William <Al- 
den were elected. 

A petition by the Atlantic Ice and 
Coal corporation to build an ice plant 
on el avenue, which was refused 
recently by the board, again was read 
and refused. 

The plans of Mr. Pilcher for the 
future are not known. He is a na- 
tive of Richmond, Va., and is expe- 
rienced in. municipal government. He 
came to Decatur on. recommendation 
on January 1, 1921, to take charge 
of the newly-formed commission gov- 
ernment of tur. 

The question now of prime impor- 
tance is, “Who will be the next city 
manager?” 


NEW CHARGES MADE 
AGAINST JAPANESE 


(Continued From Page One.) 


erately make it impossible to stabilize 
conditions in the Russian Far East. 

“3. The Japanese are organizing 
attacks against Far Eastern republic 
for the purpose of overthrowing the 
government which was elected by the 
people throggh the constituent assem- 
bly. 

“4. The attack of Baron Ungern- 
Sternberg, from Mongolia, was organ- 
ized by the Japenese. | 

“5. The Japanese cre aiming, under 
guise of establishing a ‘democracy’ of 
bandit Semenov to create a government 
which they would practigally control. 


“6. The Japanese ay ote to 
eontrol economically the’Far Eastern 
republic and to make secure for them- 
selves special privileges and conces- 
sions.”. 

U. 8. Wants Evacuation. 

Japan’s failure to withdraw her 
troops from Siberia, as provided in the 
agreement entered into in 1918 by the 
United States, Japan, Great Britain 
and France, will be aired before the 
arms conference. , 

The United States Beppe cee to- 
day, a8 it has repeatedly stated dur- 
ing the last two years, believes that 
Japan is duty-bound to evacuate Si- 
a. The '-Japanese government, 
however, takes the same attitude to- 
day that she has in answer to previous 
American representations, - namely, 
that Japanese interests must be pro- 

rly safeguarded in Siberia before 

apanese troops can be withdrawn; 
that Japan is willing to withdraw her 
troops when these safeguards have 
beeh assured, and that Japan recog- 
nizes the obligation to withdraw under 
the four-power agreement entered into 
during the war. 

Meantime, the charges of the Chita 
government of eastern Siberia—that 
Japan and France had involved them- 


7 


Ss. 
clared he was “glad to 8 y 
statement that the documents | cue 
tion are not authentic.” . : 


No Substantiation. 


’ Farther, it was declared authorita- 
tively at the state department, this 
government’s files fail to reveal any 
official communications from its prop- 
erly delegated representatives in the 
Orient, tending to substantiate the: 
charges made by the Chita’ representa 
tives. : 
Hughes’ letter to Sarraut follows: 
“IT have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of your letter ef January 
2, in which you refer to the:text of al- 
leged official documents said: to have 
passed between the French and Japa- 
nese governments and given.to the 
press by representatives of the so-call- 
ed Chita government of eqstern Si- 


 beria. 


“T am gratified fo learn. that the 
French government formally denies 
that it has come to any agreement ‘or 
carried on any negotiations eoncern- 
ing the status of Siberia and am glad 
to accept your etatement that the 
documents in question ‘are not au- 


thentic.” 
To Air Question. 

This particular situation, however, 
does not affect in any way the inten- 
tion of Secretary Hughes to bring up 
in its proper place on the agenda, the 


question of Siberian problems, partic- y 


ularly as regards preservation of. ter- 
ritorial rights, withdrawal of foreign 
troops and other questions involving 
Siberia in much the same way as they 
have involved China. 

This will open the way to the agree- 
ment, expected in the form of a sort 
of international trusteeship over Rus- 
sia, to supplant the present practice 
whereby Japan retains forces there. 

When the original four-power agree- 
ment was made in 1918 between Ja- 
pan, the United States, Great Britain 
and Franee, it provided that all should 
send some troops into Siberia to pro- 
tect the withdrawal of some Ozecho- 
Slovak forces. It was stipulated in 
this agreement both that the terri- 
tonial integrity of Russia should be 
preserved and respected and that, un- 
der the safe evacuation of the Czech 
troops, the forces of the four powers | 
should be immediately withdrawn. 


Japs Fail To Withdraw. 


The .troops of the United States, 
England and France were withdrawn, 
but the Japanese have retained their 
troops in Siberia. In response to rep- | 
resentations made by the United” 
States to Japan, both during the Wil- 
son administration and last summer, 
by Secretary Hughes, noting Japan’: 
failure to abide by her agreement, 
Japan contended that her nationals 
and holdings in Siberia, demanded pro- 
tection by her troops until the un- 
settled state of affairs had changed. 
That is still her position today. 

Thé Siberians countered the officia! 
French denials of an understanding 
with the Japanese by issuing a state- 
ment repeating their belief in the au- . 
thenticity 
public. They replied, as well, te the 
French charge that the Far Eastern re- 
public was “psuedo republic,” with a 
declaration that it had an area of #» 
million square miles, and a popula 
tion of two millions. 

They said they expected direct re. 
plies from the French on a number o/ 
specific points, dealt with in the docu 
ments. These were chiefly as to 
whether or not France had aided Gen- 
eral Semenov, or transported the 
troops of General Wrangel from south- 


ern Russia. =:

RL RATE rom 


An agreement that«the Southern 


‘reduced rate proceedings pending be- 
fore the interstate commerce commis- 


‘sion, through ‘ts committee and coun- 
'sel at the next session of the commis- 


sion in Washipgton on January 9, was 
reached at the meeting of the league 
held in the Piedmont hotel Tuesday 
afternoon. Evidence will be present- 


_ed at the hearing before the inter- 
| staate commerce commission designed 


to show that freight rates should be; 


reduced. 


Legislation and traffic policies gen- 


erally were the other topics for discus-, 


sion at the afternoon meeting. The 
adoption of the new uniform domestic 
and foreign: bills of lading was urge:. 
Claims of shippers against the rail- | 
road administration, growing out of | 
federal control of the roads, also were | 
considered. 


40 Members Present. 


About 40 members of the league | 
drawn from the principal traffie or- 
gunizations of the south were present. 
at the meeting, as well as represen- 
tatives of industries organized in the} 
south materially interested in the re- 
duction of freight rates, such as the 
coal, cotton seed products, building 

material and naval stores interests. 

At the morning session the principal 
subject for discussion was the ques- 
tion of the reduction of freight rates 


and railroad wages, which will be con-! toward development of the race along | 


sidered at the hearing before the inter- 


ark éommerce commission in Washb-

"Peking a liberal view of the freight 
rate problem, the members of the 
league recognized the pressure that is 
being brought to bear on the roads by 
beth the public and the shippers, 
though at the same time they are 
familiar with the problems that the 


| railroads are facing. and are anxious 
ito view the question from-#l angles. ;

Seeing.these bargains—and no wom-

materials she went about getting them |

From meager reports made to the 
police, it seems that the child was on 
her way home from school and was 
struck by the fender of the car and 
knocked down. It is understood that 
the driver did not slacken speed, but 
left the child lying in the road. She 
was picked up and carried to Grady

A decrease in the number of mar- 
riage licenses issued in 1921, in com- | 
parison with those issued in 1920, is | 
shown in the figures compiled ‘Tues- , 
day in the office of Judge*Ihomas H. 
Jeffries, Fulton county ordinary. 

In 1920 there were 5,297 marriage 
licenses issued, while in 1921 the 
number dwindled to 4,225, a decrease 
of 1,072. The decrease was propor- 
tionately equal among white and 
colored people. The number of mat- 
rimonial contracts issued to white 
people in 1920 was 3,238, while last 
year the number was 2,727; for 
blacks in the same years, the number 
decreased from 2,059 to 1,498. 

It was also pointed that the number 
of insane people committed to the 
state insane asylum has slumped. 

Judge Jeffries said Tuesday that 

about 110 people had been commit- | 
ted to the state insane asylum dur- | 
ing 1921, which, he says, is the small- 
est number sent to that institution 
from Fulton county in a number of 
years.

QUR MOUNTEBANK MAYOR. 
| Atlanta’s . mountebank mayor 
celebrated the occasion of the in- 
coming of the new council by de- 
livering himself of his usual 
harangue against The Constitution. 

“dt is a pity,” he said to the as- 
sembled council, “that we have no 
remedy ample enough to suppress 
such an ‘institution.’ ” 

The titter that greeted this al- 
lusion gave evidence of the faci 
that the mayor had made just 
about he same impression that he 
did a year ago when, in his opening 
address to the then new council, 
he made The Constitution an ob- 
ject of his characteristic abuse. 

The trouble with the mayor is 
that The Constitution was not. 
decile when he and his pet gang 
of bunco clients were operating on 
a scale never heard of before in 
the city of Atlanta. 

The mayor thinks “It is a queer 
sort of patriotism that would per- 
mit any respectable institution to 
Carry on a warfare like this against 
its own city and its own people.” 

The mayor confuses his obliga- 
tion to the city with his connection 
with his former clients of the 
bunco brigade. 

‘The Constitutign, following the 
action of four successive grand 
juries, pulled the veil aside and 
exposed the bunco situation, and 
naturally the mayor has not been 
im a friendly mood towards this 
“institution” since that timé, 
‘Some of the mayor’s clackers 
who, like him, have been entirely 
satisfied with police conditions in 
Atlanta.for the past year or so, feel 
that they are now far enough away 
from the exposures of the past year 
toa contend that there never was 
any ground for complaint, assert- 
ing that only one conviction fol- 
lowed those exposures. 

The Constitution is furnished | 
with a statement from Solicitor 
General Boykin giving the names 
of seven convictions of officers of 
the department, with one addition- 
al held for bribery, and two more 
being still under indictment on the 
charge of larceny after trust. 

It would be an insult to the in- 
telligence of the city for The Con- 
stitution to enter into an argument 
to prove the truth of the charge 
of four successive grand = ju- 


_ 0 


: 


- pies—that the department as It was 


conducted a year ago was either 
grossly incompetent or corrupt, | 

Council’s own investigating com- 

mittee overwhelmingly vindicated 
, thp truth of these four grand jury 
criticisms, and the matter was fi- 
nally taken before the people, who 
at the last city election by an over- 
wheiming vote sustained the posi- 
tien of The Constitution. 
' ‘When The Constitution first sug- 
gested the big bond issue, ratified 
last year by the people, urging it 
week after week and month after 
month, the mayor went in person 
before council to tell it that the 
proposition was a monstrous oue, 
and that in proposing it The Con- 
stitution, knowing that bonds 
would not. carry, was advocating 
the proposition solely to harass his 
administration. ; 

He declared then before council, 
as he did on Monday, that The 
Constitution was a terrible “insti; 
tution” and expressed his regrét 
that he could not then and there 
suppress it. 

The bond issue was submitted 
to the people and it-carried by the. 
largest majority ever given by the 
city of Atlanta on any one, propo- 
sition, and we Will do the’ mayor 
justice to say that after denounc- 

e the proposed bond issye when 
a a by The Constitution, he later 
fej im line and rendered good sérv- 
ice in its behalf.

were created, and all of the bunco 
artists that ever operated upon a 
helpless community cannot swerve 
The Constitution from the path of 
duty. 

This great old “institution” is 
going right ahead serving the peo- 
ple of Atlanta, keeping it as clean 
as possible, advocating what it 
thinks to be the best interests of 
the city and if, every once in a 
while, we run afoul of a madman, 
a freak, or a fanatic, we simply 
count it an incident in the game 
and go right ahead doing our duty 
as usual. : 

In the meantime we welcome the 
fulminations of the mayor in so 
frequently proclaiming to council 
the virtues of The Constitution as 
an “institution’—to which he’ 
might well have added “of which

The Okefenokee swamp is one 
of the great natural curiosities. of 
this continent. 

From the standpoint of science, 
beauty and picturesqueness it» is 
equal to many of the national 
parks of the Rocky mountain fre- 
gion, though, of Course, of an en- 
tirely different—in fact, exactly 
opposite—type. 

While the _ existing national 
parks, almost without exception, 
have been designated and preserved 


their extraordinary ruggedness, 
Okefenokee is an enormous ex- 
panse of placid, semi-tropica? 
wilderness, low-lying, and level as 
a platform. It is drained by the 
historic Suwanee river, which 
heads in the heart of the swamp 
and winds its sluggish way to the 
outside world through junglelands 
and dense forests of bay, magnotfa 
and stately pine, and the mos® mag- 
nificent specimens of cypress—“the 
wood eternal”—to be found any- 
where on earth. 

The jungles of Okefenokee teem 
with animal life, some species of 
which are peculiar to this swamp; 
and it contains floral species 
which, but for the few specimens 
remaining in the remote fastnesses 
of this wonderful wilderness, would 
be extinct. 

Unless something is done to pre-. 
serve tle swamp the day is not far 
distant when Okefenokee, already 
desecrated and badly scarred in 
places, will have ceased to exist as 
an area of peculiar beauty, of char- 
acteristic grandeur and the hab'tat 
of wild life. Its marvelous forests, 
the development of centuries, will 
be gone, never to be restored. 

If the wishes of the Okefenokee 
society and the recommendations 
of the national game conference 
and of the various naturalists who 
have visited it and explored its 
depths are carried out, however, 
the great swamp willbe put under 
federal protection just as the west- 
ern beauty spots have been, and 


ground for future generations. 

It is to be hoped that will be 
done; and the people of the south, 
especially those of Georgia, can 
well afford to interest themselves 
to that end, join in the movement 
and seek to enlist the sympathies 
of their congressmen and the fed- 
ra] government in its behalf.

Old Acquaintance 


HOLLOMON _ 


Washington, January 3.-—(Spe-1 
cial.)—The republican leaders.in the 
senate now say they will restore to 
the pe t tariff bill the proposed 
duty on hides that was struek from 
the temporary bill last summer. 

And, according to Senatdr Mc- 
Cumber, they have counted noses and 


will be able to enact the provision. 

Can you imagine such 4 thing? 

Can you grasp what this means, 
first to the few big packers, who own 
and produce 60 per cent of the en- 
tire tannery output in this country? 
And, secondly, to the more than one 
hundred million consumers of leather 
products, including every man, w 
an and child who wears shoes? / 

What will a duty of 15 per cent 
amount to to the independent stock 
growers who produce raw hides? 

The average stock raiser sells his 
beef cattle to the packers, who in 
turn salt down the hides from the 
butcher pens, and then tan them in 
their own plants. 

The individual hide producers, out- 
side of the packer combinations, 
whose gross production is more than 
negligible, as compared to the whole, 
are few. ss 

The duty will’ mean’ ‘practically 
nothing to them; but will work two 
ways for the packing interests, con- 
trolling as they do both the raw and 
tanned products. 

And the millions of consumers must 
foot the bi 


bill. 

It’s a sickening storye—but, just as 
might be expected. ‘Bhe Go O, P. 
‘simply made promises to the big 
‘packing interests of the country that 
‘it feels it must keep, despite the hard- 
ships that will be: thrust upon the_ 
erent masses of the country, who 
inust pay the duty plusg profit, when 
they purchase the finished products. 

Hides were on the free list in the 
MeKinley tariff. the Dingley tariff, 
the Payne-Aldrich tariff. 

Why must they be on the duty list 
now ? 

Ask President Harding! And ask 
Senator Penrose! 

And yet they talk about building 
up a strong republican party in the 
south. , 

Never by this kind of a route! ' 

It may be interesting to know just 
how many bills there are pending in 
the sixty-seventh congress to repeal 
or amend the national prohibition act. 

It will astound the average reader, 
who has not kept closely in touch 
with this matter. 

giving a list of the bills let me 
suggest there is not a ghost of a 
chance of any of them passing. 

The most important of them fol-

H. R. 5220 and H. R. 2404—Te

justice department. 

H.-R. 8956—To amend section 26 


the procedure for seizing rum- 
ning automobiles and _ collecting 
the prohibitive tax on the legal sale 
and manufacture of liquors. 

7456—Contains provisions 


ported into this country. 

There is algo a bill pending to pro- 
vide for beer by referendum vote in 
congressional districts. 


The ‘federal enforcement depart- 
ment has submitted an estimate for 
ten. million dollars to enforce na- 
tional prohibition -for the next year, 
‘this, amount to:be included in the 
‘new appropriation bill. : 

At the recent meeting of the Na- 
tional Anti-Saloon league convention 
and the national legislative confer- 
ence it was recommended by Wayne 
B. Wheeler, general counsel and _ leg- 
islative superintendent, that only 
such legislation be urged at this ses-) 
sion of congress as is, absolutely ne- 
cessary Tor an honest enforcement of 
the prohibition act. a 

There are some pending bills which’ 
vhave the .indorsement of the united 
dry forces will doubtless remain on 
the waiting list for consideration at 
a Jater date before being pressed for 
passage. 

If the wet interests press for the 
passage of bills to repeal or weaken 
the national enforcement act they 
will start something they cannot stop. 

The dry forces are not inclined to 
press for any big dry measures in 
this session, but an adequate appro- 
priation for the enforcement depart- 
ment and similar measures relating to 
the enforcement: of the present law 
‘will of course have to be considered. 


Just think of it! 

Only ‘three or four weeks ago Pre- 
mier Briand. of France, the most 
eloduent of all the statesmen at the 
conference table, lifted his voice in 
open plenary session,,with the fervor 
and force of almcest sublime oratory, 
and assured the wofld that France 
rejoiced in the plans for a limitation 
of armament, even going so far as 
to say his country.had already ac- 
complished a “moral disarmament”

And now think how France has

{REALTH TALKS 


BY WILLiAM*BRADY, M. D. 


EASIER ON THE ARTERIES, 

The medical sage who first sprang 
that hackneyed adage about a man 
being as old as his arteries lived in 
an era when feeling the pulse and 
looking at the tongue comprised - a 
thorough physical examination. Those 
were the happy days for the “diag- 
nostician” or “consulting physician, 
for, with the proper command of per-_ 
sonality, dignity or front, he had only 
to “pronounce” the trouble thus and | 
so, and that was final and authorita- 
tive; since nobody had the temerity 
to dispute him short of autopsy, and 
autopsies were mighty unpopular 
even then. 

Nowadays diagnosis has arrived at 
a stage considerably in advance of 
mere professionpl. opinion. There 
are no longer any great diagnosticians 
or consulting physicians except a few 
gods of. high secietv still left over 
here and there. Diagnosis comes 
pretty nearly being an exact science 
today. There are plenty of pathologi- 
eal conditions which are as yet deep 
mysteries to the physicians and every- 
body else on earth; and there are 
plenty of new diseases or morbid 
states appearing as fast as the un- 
knowing find nev ways to defy the 
laws of God or nature. 

The modern art of diagnosis is no 
one ma or one mind job. It involves 
the clinical group plan—a group of 
men, each with more,or less special 
t-aining in his own limited field. And 
such reputation or fame as a -physi- 
cian may acquire in diagnosis these 
days finds him almost invariably a 
- ere unit of such a team. 

I’m sorry this is so. Nobody re- 
grets rampant specialism toward 
which it leads, more than I do, In 
fact I have perhaps given a wrong 
impression by some of my allusions 
to the specialists—a good specialist 
in time of special need is a great 
blessing. 

Modern group diagnosis costs” a 
reasonable sum in comparison with 
the ridiculou# stipends of the old- 
time “consulting physician.” Mod- 
ern automobiles cost more than the 
old buggy.. There isn’t a chance for a 
jibe at the doctors here, either. How 
much’ or how little do you value 


But the arteries—I had forgotten 
them. Well, as I say, the old-timer 
ponderonsly felt the pulse, and if the 
artery was at all hardened of course 
he noted that fact. But his practiced

| TODAY’S TALK | 


BY GEORGE MATTHEW ADAMS 
“(Copyright, 1921, for The Constitution) | 


THE RICHNESS OF FRIENDSHIP 

Lincoln once said that God must 
have loved the common people a great 
deal for He made so many of them. 

In thinking of the richness of hu- 
man’ companionship and friendship, 
I have had the same thought in mind 
~-that God must have thought wond- 


‘derfully of it, or He: wouldn't have |: 


made it so very beautiful. And He 
wouldn't have made such a wonder- 
ful world, filled with beauties of so 
many kinds, had He not meant that 
this friendship should remain as the 
one cementing power to life. 

Picture yourself with nota friend 
on €arth, and you feel so lonely that 
you do not want to live at all—even 


though you were to possess the world! 

With very little in material things, 
we may be rich indeed if we have 
friends. ' 

And if we would build a life more 
than worth while, we must ourselves 
know all that it takes to make up a 
friend. 

I think that the first thing in 
friendship is loyalty. The charm and 
loveliness of friendship lies in the fact 
that our friends have most of the 
faults andi virtues common to us. Or 
else’ we couldn’t warm to them and 
love them—in their mistakes as well 
as in their near-perfections. 

The sunsets hover about the good 
and bad im Nature—and give of their 
inimitable ¢olorings as though every- 
thing they touch was perfect. 

I feel that the greatest happiness 

of my life lies in these unpretentious 
little talks to you from day to day— 
for I think of you as one of my 
friends. And I am thrifled with warm 
joy at the many expressions of kindli- 
ness that come to me from many of 
you. 
God bless you and give you a larger 
apnreciation of the richness of friend- 
shin as you work out your particular 
tas's through the Vears., 

Every time you feel a desire to be 
n hetter human heing and more help- 
ful in the world., that minute the 
entire world grows better! 

We are small units in a very great 
whole, Our resnonsihilif¥ starts | 
within ns. And then it is possible 
far our influence to rediate—to only 
Gods knows where. He takes what 
we start and finishes it as only His 
perfeet fashioning can. 

Let us. therefore, never falter in 
onr striving.

just dead, married the second 
time a daughter of Admiral Sir 
Henry Digby. They were divore- 
ed and she married a Bavarian 
Baron. She soon after ran away 
from the Bavarian and was los 
sight of for years until she wa 
discovered to be the wife of a 
Bedouin Arab Chief and in high 
standing among the wild men of 
the desert. She dressed in Arab 
style, carried weapons and com- 
manded troops of ber wild sub- 
jects in ship-shape, 

And still the censors deleted certain 
sections of “The Shiek” when it was 
filmed as being too raw for these good 
and moral times.

Then again the editor takes us back 
into the green room and gives us a 
rather intimate peep into the private 
life of the radiant Nilsson, in the fol. 
lowing story: 


The New York Commercial Ad- 
vertiser says some  ungallant 
things about Nilsson, the oper- 
atic divinity, who recently won 
Atlanta. It asserts that she ‘has. 
a bad temper, is jealous, and 
flirts awfully. She snubs Miss

Expected to Greet 
Russian Pianist 


TO WALTER BARNWELL 


As a token of admiration. and of 
appreciation for his work during 1921, 
Walter Barnwell, retiring president of 
the Kiwanis club, was presented with 
a handsome silver’ service by the club 
Tuesday at its first 1922 luncheon. 
The presentation was made by Henry 
Heinz, a former president. 

Mr. Barnwell is one of Atlanta’s 
best-known business men. He is secre- 
tary und treasurer of the Ragan-Ma- 
lone company. His term of office in 
the club expired in December. J. 
Sherrard Kennedy, cashier of the At- 
lanta National bank, succeeds him. 

In the speech of presentation, Mr. 
Heinz stressed the fact that Kiwanis 
is not provincial, but. international, 
having clubs throughout. the - United 


*') States and Canada. 


_ “We feel that we have one of 
best clubs in the country,” Mr. Heinz 
said. “Therefore, it is a digtinct hon- 
ar to be the leader or president of 
a.. organization like this. I know. 
hecause I have pessed throngh it, and 
Y fee] that it ig indeed an honor. that 
does not come very often to a man. 

“So, today, on the first of the new 
year. it becomes my duty and privilege 
in giving a tangible token or evidence 
of our esteem for the leader of our 
elub during the year ¥921. 

Judge by Results. 

“I know how one must use his 
best talent and ability to keep the 
club in harmony and good humor, and 
1, taerefore, know that you can judge 
a man’s efforts by his results. 

“Three years ago the personnel of 
‘ue Kiwanis club of Atlanta was notn- 
ing et all like@t is today. You can 
but glance at the membership here 
present to see the representative men 
of Atlanta, men who are leaders and 
have accomplished things, men who 
are representative business men of 
Atlanta, who today are engaged in 
building, not only in their own inter- 
ests, but for Atlanta. 

“The results derived, and the per- 
eounel of this club today, are largely 
due to the assiduous, long-suffering 
and untiring energies of W alter Barn- 


e! 
“The first of last year Mr. Barnwell, 
as president, came to me and told of 
his plans and desires and hopes for 
the Kiwanis club. One thing stood 
out pre-eminently in his aspirations, 
and that was his desire to build up 
the personnel of the Kiwanis club so 
that whenever new meinbers come in 
they will feel that they are coming 
into a club of purely representative 
inen, and I think the membership we 
have with us today, which has been 
taken in during the last year, speaks | 
more eloquently than words, 
Pulling Together. 


“Another thing. The civic organi- 
zations of this city are pulling togeth- 
er now—something they did not do 
hbefore—the result of his efforts, for 
these civic organizations have gotten 
together and organized a little quorum. 
so to speak. 

‘Besides these things for the good 
of our own organization and the city. 
[ can continue indefinitely to tell of 
the wonderful work done for us. Mr. 
Barnwell knows-that he has our love 
and affection, and I ask him to kindly 
accept this silver service as tangible 
token of our love and devotion, and 
we hope that he will enjoy it all 
the more because it is given him witb 
our love.” 

Jhe retiring president responded 
briefly. “The things that I have done 
were necessary and adequate, and 
whatever I have done has been done 
from my heart, with my love for Ki- 
wanis and my love for you, and this 
token is accepted in the same spirit in 
which I have given anything that I 
may have given.”

Great Audience| 


Sergei Rachmaninoff. the great 

Russian composer, orchestral © con- 
ductor and pianist, who comes: to: the 
Auditorium for a piano recital on 
Wedensday of next week, is expected 
to be weleomed by an " audience of 
exceptional proportions, foy nd ‘only 
is he one of the foremost figures in 
the musical world today, but he has 
the added advantage of having been 
heard here before—and Atlanta sel- 
dom gives her best reception on first 
acquaintance. «But Ruachmaninoftf’s 
recital two seasons ago aroused so 
much comment that he is certain to 
attract thany more music-lovers this 
year. 
The famous Russian made a distinct 
impression then not only through his 
magnificent playing, but through his 
unique and interesting personality. 
He was quiet, even m , off the 
platform., The sorrows of his friends 
and relatives in revolutionary Russia 
were oppressing him* he had escaped 
only a short time before from the 
uprisings. His melancholy was re 
flected, too, in his playing. But the 
few who had opportunity to meet him 
and who broke through his crust of 
reserve, found him charming. 

There is nothing peculiar or freak- 

ish in his appearance. ‘Tal, broad- 
shouldered and sober of countenance, 
he does not look the typical musi- 
cian. His face is unemotional, but 
his playing commands every emotion. 
He has wonderful command of tech- 
nique, but even the most ardent of 
piano students forgets that as he lis- 
tens, for Rachmaninoff plays 
“straight at the heart.” 
* Mr. Rachmaninoff’s program has 
not been announced, but it is known 
to include some of his own works 
and representative numbers from oth- 
er composers. He is a famous inter- 
preter of Chopin. Seats for the re- 
cital go on sale Friday at the Cable 
Piano company store.

ON THRE CHARGES 


Arthur Lee West, 21-year-old negro, 
of 72 Old Wheat street, was bound 
over ‘Tuesday by Recorder George 
Johnson on two charges of burglary 


and one of attacking a young white | 
ivurse at Davis-Fischer  sanitarium. 
Toh saat was ordered held in $5,000 | 


West was arrested on December 7 
by Officers W. A. Chewning and H. L, | 
Turner. His arrest was the culmina-. 
tion of an exciting chase after the 
negro is said to have attempted to 
snatch the purse of Mrs. Cox, of 200 


est Peachtree street. 


| Linden streets shortly after 6 o'clock 
when they heard a scream. Hasten- | 
ing to the corner, they were told of: 
the attempted robbery. and __ they 


-eaught a glimpse of a negro fleeing 


he was finally cap- 
tured after hiding behind an = au- 
tomobile top, he attempted to leap 
a fence. ‘He sprained his ankle and 
his capture resulted. | 

The officers stated the negro, at his 
jae before Judge Johnson, denied 
the attack on a Davis-Fischer sani- 
tarium nurse several weeks ago, but 
they asserted they believe he is the 
man who has been sought in this 
connection. ; 
ee 2 ose Bh who — a window of 
the nurse’s home, on en street, ap- 
parently bent on robbery, was discoy- 

by a nurse, who A Bmad and 

the man, in his effort to escape and 
quiet the girl, is said to have struck 
her over the head with a blunt in- 
strument. - 


The practice of weighing diamonds 


| by karat began with the decision of 
Officers Chewning and Turner were the natives in the African diamond 


taken 
from the mines by comparing them 
with the bean of the coral tree, a 
measurement, after which buyers 
agreed and fixed the karat at 200

Lenroot Is Reported to 
Have Sought Ousting of 
La Follette From Re- 
publican Ranks. 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 
Constitution Bureau. 
Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, January 3.—(By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.)—A war to 
the finish has developed between Sen- 
ators Robert M. La Follette and Irvine 
L.. Lenroot, of Wisconsin. 
Mr. Lenroot is seeking to bave his 


former friend and political supporter 
wutlawed as a republican by his party 
colleagues in the senate, but so far has 
failed. Mr. La Follette is seeking to 
have Mr. Lenroot placed definitely as 
a reactionary republican instead of a 
“sane progressive,’ as Mr. Lenroot 
calls himself. 

Political patronage figures to no 
small extent in the fight, which is ex- 
pected to increase in intensity as the 
time for Senator La Follette to stand 
for re-election next fall draws nearer. 
1t has just been established in Wash- 
ington that Lenroo’ formally proposed 
in a recent meeting of the senate com- 
mittee on committees that La Follette 
be read out of the republican party. 

Opposed by Moses. 

Senator George H. Moses, of New 
Hampshire, an old guard protection- 
ist on tariff matters, but an ally of 
Senator La Follette in the fight to kill | 
the Versailles treaty and the league 
of nations covenant, opposed the move | 
of Lenroot. Senator Moses asserted 
that when a senator won the party 
nomination in a republican primary 
and was elected as a republican, the 
other ‘republican senators had no right 
to outlaw him or question his party 
affiliation simply because he did not 
vote “regular” on administration or 


party measures. 


Reports of the executive session at | 
which Lenroot proposed to oust his | 
colleague from the party, all of which | 
have been carefully guarded until the | 


j 
! 
| 


last few days, are that the junior | 
Wisconsin senator exhibited copies * 
La Follette’s weekly in an effort to} 
show that the senior senator was iat] 
loyal to the republican party in the 
last campaign and sought to defeat 
President Harding. It is understood 


Miuthat these copies were shown at es 


coljefsent administration before it had 


_hite house in the early days of the , 


ularen definitely decided that La Follette | 


3chould be ignored in the distribution | 


of federal patronage in Wisconsin. 
Many Ramifications. 

The fight between the Wisconsin | 
senators has many ramifications. It 
has created strong affiliation in the 
Fenate for both men. For many years | 
Senator La Follette was a bitter and | 


~ ontspoken antagonist of Senator Boies | 


time, 


Penrose, of Penngylvania, but after | 
the old guard feaders in the senate 
hlocked tue move to unseat La Fol- 
lette for his Minnesota speech in war 
the two senators greeted each 


day, 


| copal diocese of Atlanta, 


'this discussion being 


other as “Bob” and “Hotes.” Senator 
Moses and Senator La Follette fre- 
quently are seen with their heads to- 
ss on the senate floor, and Sena- 
tor Moses does not hesitate to say 
kind words for the senior senator from 
Wisconsin. 

On the other hand, Senator Len- 
root is looked upon as an administra- 
eee spokesman on some politics. He 
land Vice President Coolidge have 
ua'vy confidential discussions in the 
lounging room back of the senate 
chamber. When it has been necessary 
to work out a compromise to get 
through an administration measure, 
as when the agricultural bloc threat- 
ened to join the democratic minority 
and defeat the republican proposals on 
excess profits, tax repeal and reduc- 
tions in the higher surtaxes, Lenroot 
frequently has acted as the go- 
between. | 

La Follette and the republican mem- 
bers of th house of representatives 
who are his supporters in Wiscon- 
sin, believe they have maneuvered 
Lenroot into a position most distaste- 
ful to him as a result of his attempt 
to act as patronage distributor not 
only on statewide appointments, which 
usually are made upon recommenda- 
tions of the senators, but on postoffice 
appointments within districts repre- 
sented by La Follette republicans, 

La Follette’s Tactics. 

La Follette and his sympathizers 
in the house have pursued a consistent 
policy of recommending veterans of 
the world war and out-and-out pro- 
gressives for federal appointments, 
and have sought to put Lenroot “‘in 
a hole,” forcing him to recommend 
conservative republicans‘for the places. 
They do not hesitate to assert that 
he is depending on the indorsements 
of organization republicans throughout 
the state in filling minor postoffice 
vacancies where he could not be fa- 
miliar with the qualifications of the 
various candidates. 

La Follette republicans, like Kep- 
resentative J. D. Beck, of Wisconsin, 
whose postoffice patronage has been 
taken out of their hands, claim that 
the loss of their postoffice appoint- 
ments is helping instead of hurting 
them in their districts. Had they 
been recognized as the distributors 
they would have had to choose in most 
cases from a field of ten or twelve po- 
litical friends, and each man who did 
not get the appointment would be an- 
gered by his failure. As it is now, 
it is asserted, they leave these offices 
to Lenroot to worry about. 

La Follette admitted before leav- 
in Washington for Wisconsin that he 
was going back to look after his politi- 
cal fences. Lenroot recently has made 
several trips to the state for the same 
purpose.

per cent prohibition representatives in 
congress, violations of the law were

cellent -work of officers or the great 
number of violations and the great op- 
portunity for enforcement work brings 
out that southern states led through- 
out the country. 

In the number of arrests made, 
Ohio, the home of the Anti-Saloon 
league and the home of President Har- 
ding and Attorney General Daugher- 
ty, led with 3,334. ‘The other leading 
states were New York, Lllinois, Mas- 

chusetts, Texas, California, Mis- 
feeri, Georgia and North Carolina.

operative marketing of the south’s 
resolutions indorsing this movement. 

The principal speaker of the day 
was George W. Hanson, president of 
the Hanson Motor company. Mr, 
Hanson’s address showed faith in the 
future of the automobile business, and 
the probability of u profitable business 
this, year. But there was a complete 
absence of the reckless optimism so 
pronounced among automobile men 
during the period of war prosperity. 

His admonition to the dealers to 
continue work, and put as many other 
men to work as possible, was received 
with applause. Mr. Hanson made no'| 
effort to discount the period of de- 
pression through which the country 
as a whole. is passing, but rather 
made a * for finding and applying

sion whieh followed Mr. Hanson’s talk 
brought pledges from the automobile 
men to follow Mr. Hanson’s sugges- 
tion to employ as many unemployed 
men, as possible, even at the expense 
of wage scales. 

Mr. Hanson told the men that his 
factory has adopted the policy of em- 
ploying more men, and, as far as pos- 
sible, dividing the payroll among 4a 
greater number of people, so that all 
former employees would have an op- 
portunity to earn a living.

This film illustrated many methods | , 
which the dealer can use to increase 
his profits by increasing sales and 
rroperly controlling, the purchasing 
and merchandising of automotive 
equipment. This film had no smack | 
of advertising whatever, it being. as

‘Dancing Class 
At Standard Club. 


The Standard club dancing class will 
resume activities Friday afternoon at 


3:30 o’clock. The older members will 
assemble at 4 o’clock. 


Savannah. 

The principal address was made by 
Mrs. Albert E. Thornton, who spoke 
in her triple capacity of farmer, voter 
and advecate of good roads. 


Quotes ‘Constitution. 


_ She found the theme of her address 
in The Constitution’s editorial of 
Tuesday morning, which stated the 
plight of the progressive farmer who 
has successfully diversified his. crops 
—an economic procedure backed by 
the most scientific and common sense 
principle—and finds himself unable 
in Georgia to market his products. 

The Constitution’s editorial called 
for.a solution of the problem, which 
Mrs. Thornton declared lies in good 
roads, which wil be an answer also 
te.the problem of high freight rates. 

She explained the plan of the Geor- 
gia Good Roads association, of which 
she is president, this body recently 
organized to meet the federal appro- 
priation for goods roads with a state 
bend issue and she made plain the 
method the association’s advocates by 
which the issue may be financed and 
the bonds paid without any increase 
in taxes. . 

She asked the co-operation of the

PEOPLE WHO USE MISLI-ADING HEADLINES 


Not long ago I heara a woman com-

Minded the Individual Instance. 
She was very indignant at that mo- 

because some affair, in which 
were involved had 

made ridiculous by that method. 
don’t really think she minded the 


savor for her delectation news about 
people in whom she had no personal 
interest. 

Be that as it may, what interests 
ne about het declaration was this. 

She is a great person for putting 
sensational, misleading headlines on 
things herself. 

I once happened to be present at a 
conversation between her and  an- 
other woman in.which both got pret- 
ty angry. Later I heard her describ- 
ing that conversation to a third per- 
son. “And Mrs. B. said that the 
president of the club told her that if 
it weren’t for her work the bazar 
could never have ‘been held.” 

The News Without the Headline. 

What Mrs. B. had actually said 
was.that the president of the club 
had told her that if it hadn’t been for 
her work and that of one or-; two 


others the bazar would probably have 
been a failure. 

How is that for headline writing? 
What kind of a twist did it give to 
the interview ? 

Here is another kind of sensational 
headline writing that people some- 
times do. ‘They take one fact and 
headline it in their minds. For in- 
stance, the jealous woman will take 
one thing which her husband has said 
about some woman he has met, and 
putting aside all the other things he 
has also said, will headline this one 
remark in her mind in a way that 
gives it an importance it never had. 

The Supersensitive Person. 

Or the supersensitive person will 
take some fancied slight on the part 
of a friend, and forgetting all the real 
kindnesses and evidences of prefer- 
ence on the part of the same friend, 
will headline that one slight in a 
way that makes it the keynote of 
their relationship. 

And so it goes. 

Headlines have their place in news- 
papers—just try to fancy one without 
them—but in life I think they are a 
cause of much misunderstanding and 
unhappiness.

Committee, the Board of Directors 


controlling the Dae Health Laboratorieshave 
authorized the free distribution of one mil- 
lion large packages of valuable nutrition 


If you were to see an actual! blood test made 
on all people who are ill, weak, thin, nervous 
and generally run-down, you would probably 
be greatly astonished at the exceedingly large 
number who lack fron and whose troubles are 
due solely to this lack of from. The moment 
iron is supplied a multitude of dangerous 
symptoms disappear. 

For centuries scientists tried in vain to make 
organiciron. At last the problem was solved, 
so that you may now obtai» pure organic iron 
like the iron fm your blood from any 
druggist under the name of ‘‘Nuxated Iron”, 
which is ready for 
immediate absorp- 
tion and assimilation 
by the blood the mo- 
ment it enters the 
system. Unlike me- 
tallic fron, organic 
Nuxated fron does 
not injure or blacken 
the teeth nor upset 
the stomach. 

If you are thin and 
emaciated and wish 
to put on flesh and in- 
crease your weight, 
Yeast Vitamines should be tried in connection 
with organic Nuxated Iron, but DO NOT 
TAKE VITAMINES UNLESS YO! DESIRE 
YOUR WEIGHT INCREASED. 

Vitamines are exceedingly valuable in put- 
ting fiesh on thin people, who are too thin 
as a result of Vitamine deficiency. Some 
people are naturally too thin and will remain 
so in spite of Vitamines and everythingelse. 
Vitamines will not help everybody, but they 
are of great value in certain cases. They will 
not do any harm in any case and it costs you 
nothing to try them as explained below. 

Following the report of the Medics! Research 
Committee, the Board of Directors of the Dae 
Health Laboratories have arranged to distri- 
bute, absolately free, one million regular $1.00 
packages of Genuine Yeast Vitamine Tablets

It May Be That the Struggle of Skirts 
Will Be Transferred to Blouses for 
the Shape Worn Over the Skirt Is 
Continuing Its Fight to Oust the 
One Worn Under the Skirt. 


increasing argument on 

be featured in early spring might 
be called France versus America. Une 
can ask at many shops for the simple 
ov7erblouse that ean be worn for sports 
or under a coat suit on the street, but 
one gets slight satisfaction. The 
blouse that goes under the skirt is 
offered, or the so-called costume blouse 
which is knee length, has beaded orna- 
mentation, an ornate girdle and Is 
frankly intended to patch up a Ccos- 
tume when the, coat is removed. we 
She 


machine-knitted silk or heavy crepe de 
chine, and she does not object to faille 
or silk-watered poplin. She finds the 
utmost difficulty in getting it and 
usually ends by going to a dressmaker 
to have it made. 

All Europe is attired in the jumper 
blouse instead of the shirtwaist. There 
it is the exception to have a tuck-in 
blouse offered; women are supposed 
to prefer the kind that does not need 
careful adjustment beneath a skirt 
with a belt at the waistline. One can- 
not get the long waistline with such a 
shirtwaist, say those who sell blouses 
in France and England. 

Over here, those who sell blouses say 
that women get the long waistline by a 
belt on a sweater and contend that 
American women prefer the two gar- 
ments—the sweater and shirtwaist— 
rather than the overblouse which car- 
ries its own hipline. Here the over- 
blouse for simple wear is much ex- 
ploited and seldom found. It is ex- 
ceedingly difficult to get one in the 
great centers and impossible in the 
small towns. The shops ask astound- 
ir prices for such a shape as if its 
extra length was an excuse for the 
difference between it and the other 
kind of blouse. 

The average overblouse here is so 
short it Woes not permit of a length- 
ened waistline. It barely meets the 
skirt bel In Europe the blouse 
comes down to the bone of the hip and 
is tightened there with some sort of 
girdle which may be woven in the ma- 
terial or applied as a separate orna- 
mnt. There is no exploitation of 
the sweater and blouse combined, such 
as the Americans demand. In France 
the garment is called a jumper when it 
is intended for suits and sports and by 
that name one secures fascinating 
pieces of apparel that look as well 
without a coat as with one. They are 
as plain as pipe stems, not an inch of 
trimming showing on theie surfaces, 
and the fabries of which they are fash- 
ioned are limited. Beige, ivory and 
gray are the chosen colors. There is 
no attempt to match the color of the 
snit or the skirt.

The trade people assure us that the 


| demand in America is growing suffici- 


ently strong to induce them to order a 
few of these jumpers, but the strange 
thing is that nearly every woman who 
has been abroad has inquired for these 
garments ever since her return and 
cannot get what she wants. In choos- 
ing them, instead of a blouse and 
sweater, the French prove their repu- 
tation for economy. The proposition 
of dressing for active duties or pleas- 
ures is thus simplified. But we seem 
to be sweater mad, so just there must 
be the reason for the divergence of 
fashion between France and America, 
The waistcoat idea has taken hold 
of both countries and there will be a 
Stronger expression of this fashion 
when the southern’ season is at its 
height. The waist coat blouse is not 
looked upon with enthusiasm here, but 
there is much generosity shown to the 
deep overblouse which carries orna- 
mentation in the form of a vest. Thin 
blouses carry a stole of figured bro- 
cade or foulard which makes a brave 
showing at the opening of the jacket, 
and as none of the new coats make a 
pretence of fastening, it is well to 
have some kind of under garment that 
fills the hiatus.

THE HOUSEHOLD 


Edited by Anne Rittenhouse 
THE COLORED LINEN HAND. 
KERCHIEF. . 


ORD comes from Paris that 

the colored linen handkerchief 

as a decorative part of the 
tailored suit igs in vogue. And this 
fashion will be emphasized in the 
spring, when American women are 
prone to take to the tailored suit con- 
sisting of jacket and skirt. We may 
wear one-piece frocks and enveloping 
the winter quite 
willingly, but most of us crave at least 
one tailored suit when spring comes, 
There is.a freshness, perhaps, about 
the constantly changing blouse that we 
like. Anyway, we sponsor’ and advo- 
cate the tailored suit, especially when 
spring comes. 

So, to get back to the linen hand- 
kerchief of color, have you mastered 
the art of making it? 

It is an easy matter, and one quite 
worth while. For you can make a 
lovely little handkerchief of materials 
costing a quarter, and for the same 
handkerchief made you. would pay 
from a dollar and a quarter to two 
and a half dollars. our time and 
handiwork, of course, are what make 
the difference. 

Here’s how to do it: Draw a thread 
straight across one side of a handker- 
ch:ef size square of colored linen. This 
may be any place from half to two 
inches from the edge. Skip one thread 
and draw two more. Then pull the 
middle thread out half an inch at one 
end. Tie it around a loop in a long, 
double piece of thin colored embroid- 
ered cotton. Now carefully, by means 
of the other end of the middle thread, 
pull the colored thread into place. 

You can’ make any sort of designs 
you wish to, once you have mastered 
the art of pulling these threads. The 
edge of the handkerchief may be whip- 
ned with colored thread or hemmed or 
hemstitched. Some shops sell the 
squares of linen. Others sell it by 
the yard. A third of a yard cuts 
nicely into three.

In the Realm of Music 


BY LOUISE DOOLY 


Atlantans face for January very 
happy musical prospects in the com- 
ing of concert. artists of: interna- 
tional distinctién, an@ the preésenta- 


tion of study club events also of val- 
ue in the cultural life. 

Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose recital 
will be an event of the llth, needs 
no exploitation. His fame is draw- 
ing card enough. While not a sen- 
sational pianist in the usual accept- 
ance of the term, yet such is the 
force of his personality, combined 
with an art that places him in the 
front rank of contemporary concert 
celebrities, that his appearances inva- 
riably approach the sensational in in- 
terest. His Atlanta audience of two 
years ago will be the best advertisers 
for his forthcoming appearance here. 
. Nelson Illingworth, who comes 
on the 14th, needs a bit more of 
explanation. His looks would hard- 
ly suggest the artist. He bears a 
striking likeness to Abraham Lincoln 
in his youth, not a very prepossessing 
likeness for a singer. And yet it is 
as an interpreter that Illingworth 
has made his fame. 

The long, lank stinger is an Aus- 
tralian. Arriving last winter in New 
York in the middle of the season, he 
was soon the sensation of the musical 
life of the large cities. 

Action, as much of it as the taste 
of the concert stage will permit, is 
part of his interpretive medium, and 
so graphic is this feature of his ef- 
fectiveness that the newspapers are 
printing “serial pictures” of him; a 
succession of photographs that por- 
tray varying phases of his facial ex- 
pression of emotion. 

This Illingworth does in no clap- 
trap style, however, but it is the 
inevitable visible sign of the emotion, 
his art, his feeling, put into his 
voice. 


_He is being presented -by the Ma 
sic club in its “series in times,’ a 
fortunate thing, since the size of Egle- 
ston hall will permit very much mores} 
successfully than would a larger ha® }@ 
the full carrying home of his most. |@ 
intimate interpretive shades and ef- | # 
fects. | 

Then on the 21st, another Satu 
day afternoon affair, will be sreneheell 
the Kouns sisters, “mirror-voiced 
singers,’ whose story reads like ro- 
mance. These two beautiful women, 
who have become noted artists in 
spite of the handicap of wealth, wi 
also provide a Music club matinee. 

A special concert will be put on 
by the Music club on January 7 
when the works of Susan Dyer will 
form the program. 

Miss Dyer is the/ daughter of th® 
late Admiral Dyer, of the United 
States navy. Her mother was prom- 
inently identified with the General 
Federation of Women’s Clubs of: Flor- 
ida. Miss Dyer is the state pres 
dent of the Florida Federation of 
Music Clubs, a part of the South At- |) 
lantic district of federnted /music |? 
clubs, of which Miss Nan B. 8te- r 
phens, of Atlanta, is president. j 

Of Miss Dyer’s musical attainmen® 
much has been said by the foremost 
critics of the country. She has won 
the Yale prize for orchestral compo- 
sition, and her works for voice and 
instruments are well known, having 
had hearings in all parts of the coun- 
try. 

Then there will take place today, 
January 4 a lecture recital on “Mod- 
ern Music,” by Dean H. H. Bell 3 
mon, of Chicora college, an acy’ 
knowledged connoisseur on modern 
music, and Miss Purcell, of the same 
college, a pianist of unusual talent 
for modern works, who will be pre- 
sented at the morning meeting of th 
music club. 


Mr. and Mrs. Mills

A beautiful affair of Monday after- 
noon was the informal open house 
party at which Mr. and Mrs. William 
Haines Mills entertained their friends 
at their home, Kildaire ‘ottage, in 
North Boulevard park. 

Southern smilax, palms, cut flow- 
ers and holiday fancies were used in 
the decorations of the house. An open 
fire added a cheerful note, and un- 
shaded tapers burning in antique gir- 
ardoles afforded a soft light. Small 
silver bells were suspencel from the 
chandelier in tre iining .oom, with 
an artistic arrangement of red tulie 


and fern, whivoa led to silver candle- 
sticks on the table, hich held red 
tapers. The centerpiece on the table 
was a Christ:mis plant with brigbt red 
berries, and ‘he confections served 
carried out the color scheme cf red 
and green. Del‘cious punch and cof- 
fee were served by Misa Pearl Elii-

Who’s Who in the Story. 


Jeanne Dare, known in the little 
Iowa town whence she came as plain 
Jane Dare, has set herself up in New 
York as a wealthy woman in the hope 
of snaring a rich husband. In this 
effort she is making use of 

Richard Canby, well-known 
about town. Canby invites 
to a dinner together with 

Mrs. Adele Parkinson, a widow and 
former flame of his. At dinner she 
meets 

Vie Barstowe, heir to the reputed 
millions, who shows signs of infatu- 
ation with her : i 

Signor Bonnicetti, a famous viglin- 
ist, asks only to serve Jeanne, ahd she 
uses him as a ‘drawing card to her tea 
party. 

Adele foils Victor Barstowe’s at- 
tempt to linger for a tete-a-tete with 
Jeanne. 

As Jeanne is starting for a dinner 
engagement, Henry Harrison tele- 
phones, 

He informs Jeanne that he can bor- 
row nothing on her worthless land. 

Selby North, gossiping. elderly 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barstowes 
fhany flirtations. 

Harrison comes to breakfast to ar- 
range for the transfer of property, 
and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents him as a business ac- 
quaintance. as 

Canby offers a “market tip’ as a 
means for Jeanne to make some 
mofiey., and Jeanne, troubled by credi- 
tors, is tempted to invest, and finally 
buys some stock, assured by Canby 
that he himself will assume the finan- 
cial risk.

INSTALLMENT NO. 18. 
FORTUNE 
SMILES. 

it was a rather distrait Jeanne who 
betook herself to her dinner party 
that evening. Perfectly gowned, as 
always, smilingly gracious but grave- 
eyed, as always, her mind was dis- 
tinetly troubled by the memory _of 
that unexpected encounter with Vic- 
tor Barstowe in the Biltmore lobby. 

She believed she had been success- 
ful in concealing her annoyance from 
Canby. But she had conféssed to him 
with apparent light amusement that 
she had told young Barstowe she was 
teaing with the Barclays, and not 
with him; and that Barstowe would 
probably be rather offended at her 
obvious falsehood. 

Canby had laughed indulgently. The 
story flattered his amour propre. To 
know .that Jeanne had deliberately 
declined to tea with one of the hand- 
somest and most eligible young men in 
town, and then accepted his own in- 
vitation, was gratifying. Canby had 
reached the age when, despite the at- 

ition his wealth and social posi- 
tion brought him, he liked the assur- 
ance that he was intresting to pret- 
ty rirls 

Theater followed the dinner that 
night, and around midnight the party 
wound up at one of the fashionable 
hotels for the supper-dance. 

Jeanne was “toddling” with Selby 
North, trying not to feel ridiculous 


.bécause she was fully a head talfer 


than her partner, when she chanced 
to glance at a wallside table. 

There, cosily seated under the pink 
shaded candlelight, their heads close 
together in earnest conversation 
across the little table were Adele 
Parkinson and Henry Harrison. 

Jcanne lost step, and her partner 
grunted his surprise at the flaw in 
her usuall; perfect performance. 

“Excuse me,” she murmured, “IJ 
just saw some people I knew.” 

He twisted his head around in the 
direction she was facing, sut Jeanne 
quickly averted her glance from the 
absorbed pair. It was hardly likely, 
but barely probable, that North’s keen 
eyes would trace a. resemblance in 
the well-groomed man facing Adele 
Parkinson to the young westerner 
about whom he had quizzed her so 
closely the uit before, whe his 
cab had drewn up while she was bid- 
ding Harrien good night. 

When North took her back to the 
table where the others were hrving 
lobster salad, she found that she was 
seated facing Adele and her young 
Lochinvar. 

The rear view of Harrison's head 
and shoulders were quite unrecog- 
nizable. He wore the latest hair cut. 
Exactly the proper amount o: collar 
sho above his well-cut dinner 

His shoulders were broad and 


ani constantly, without a glance about 
them. 

is Adele thought she was showing 
him the sights ot Manhattan, she was 
going about it in a queer way, thought 
Jeanne humorously. ‘The only sight 
Henry was seeing was the charming 
widow herself. 

Jeaane, for the first time taking 
1.ote of Adele’s appearance, was 
amazed to discover a difference. Per- 
haps the change accounted for the 
fact that no other members of the 
party had recognized Mrs. Parkinson 
and haled her over to their table. 

Adele had discarded her Oriental 
effect in evening attire. Gone were 
the earrings, the enveloping chains, 
the bizarre ring’, the darkened eye- 
lids and too-crimson mouth. The 
clinging gown of abbreviated bodice 
and elongated train was not being 
worn tonight. 

The young widow was clad in a 
girlishly simple gown with a modest 
decollettage. Her hair was simply 
dressed, and finished with a comb ex- 
aggerated in neither size nor design. 
She wore a single necklace of pearls. 

Jeanne felt a warm wave of appre- 
ciation for Mrs. Parkinson’s tact. How 
few women would have been thought- 
ful enough not to try to dazzle the 
westerner with a great show of fash- 
ion and opulence. Most of them 
wouid have considered that the ocea- 
sion warranted showing him the most 
bizarre ‘and extravagant costuming 
which they could devise. 

Neither Adele or Harrison saw 
Jeanne. She contrived that they 
shouldn't by pleading a headache and 
leaving early, assiduously accompa- 
nied by Selby North, who tried to kiss 
her in the gloom of ..is car as it bore 
them to her hotel. 

She put aside his clinging hands, 
passing the sentimental moment off 
with a light Jaugh. In fact, she did 
t so well that North was not only 
not offended, but firmly convinced 
that her rejection of his advances was 
due rather to circumstances and en- 
vironment than to lack of favor. He 
earnestly believed that, given a moon 
and a romantic setting, he wculd be 
treated with more kindness. 

Jeanne awoke next morning, weary 
after the tiresome previous day. She 
had breakfasted in bed, and passed 
the morning reading the papers and 
. atches out of a popular novel that 
was arousing excited discussion. The 
I‘orbes’ guests ¢:ould be sure to talk 
about it. Jeanne wanted to be posted 
with some individual opinion beside 
the regular. critics’. 

There was a brief note in the mail 
from Harrison written just before his 
departure for the west. He had stay- 
ed over until the 2 o’clock train. He 
thanked her for a “bully evening.” 
Mrs. Parkinson was “a peach.” She 
had promised to write to him and to 
send him some of the new books. He 
enclosed a ten-dollar bill. Would 
Jeanne be good enough to send her 
some flowers—he believed she had 
mentioned liking narcissus? He hated 
to trouble Jeanne with the errand, 
knowing how busy she was: but he 
was an awful duffer about such 
things. He was “Yours as always, 
Henry.” 

Jeanne laughed aloud. : 

“You’re coming on, Henry!” she 
picked up the ten-dollar bill. This 
would fill her apartment with narcis- 
sus! 

But she dutifully picked up the 
telephone and directed the hotel florist 
to send the required blossoms up to 
Mrs. Parkinson. 

Around mid-afternoon she rose, 
bathed, and made a careful toilet. She 
felt fresh and radiant again. The 
maid came and dressed her hair, and 
packed the gowns Jeanne laid out. 
She hooked Jeanne into a smart aft- 
ernoon frock, and adjusted a veil 
smoothly over a jaunty little hat. 

It was 5 before Jeanne was ready 
to start to the Forbes’ week-end 
party. She had dallied purposely un- 
til she knew Canby would have call- 
ed for Adele Parkinson. She didn’t 
want to run the risk of meeting them 
in the lobby and being forced to ac- 
company them. Arriving in Canby’s 
car might prove the last touch to the 
impression Victor Barstowe was al- 
ready forming about her and Canby 
after that unfortunate encounter the 
previous afternoon. 

She crossed the avenue to pur- 
chase a new book to take down in 
the car, and was just reaching the 
farther curb when she heard her name 
called. 

A long, low, blue car drew up be- 
side her, and Victor Barstowe’s jaugh-

boyish smile deepened the cleft m his 
chin, “if you haven’t a previous ar- 
rangement, won't you let me play 
chauffeur for you?’ 

Jeanne was exaltant, but she hid 
it under a doubtful smile while she 
considered, brows drawn. Barstowe 
waited anxiously. 

The very card she wanted, but 
dared not hope for, had been played 
into her hand,

ONE REEL YARNS 
THE FIDDLER. 
It’ was a dark winter night. A 


knee-deep snow covered the ground. | 


“The gang” was out in full, packing 
hard snowballs, “peppering” neighbor- 
hood windows, then ducking into the 
shadows to watch the angry folk peer 
outsfrom behind the shades to see who 
was “hammering on the pane.” It 
was great sport. 

The fellows had just finished giving 
a dose of snowballs to the side window 
of the old Morton place, which was in- 
habited by a “funny old guy who 
playd the fiddle all the time.” All 
the boys had slipped quickly into the 
shadows to watch the white-haired old 
man come to the window, All of them, 
that is, except Randy McCune. He 
stood perfectly still under the window. 
The faint strains of the old man’s “fid- 
dle’ came through the closed window. 
The bunch, hidden behind trees, whia- 
pered hoarsely to Randy to “duck be- 
fore he got caught,” but Randy, still 
listening to the violin, remained. The 
gang knew Randy was interested in 
music, and violin music esp®cially. But 
that was no reason why he should risk 
getting caught. 

Suddenly the music stopped. The 
drawn shade at the window went up. 
The figure of the old man appeared. 
He saw Randy_ standing below the 
window. But Randy, much to the 
astonishment of the gang did not

OHAPTER X. 
The Battle tor a Soul. 
She real “hop-yen” got its grips 
m Dopy Dan the morning of the fol- 
owing day. A night of insomnia, 


“. troubled by growing hallucinations and 
_ gradually superinducing an intolera- 


ble desire for morphine, brought the 
wreck,. before daybreak, to a truly 
pitiable condition of weakness, an- 
guish and despair. Though the more 
acute stages of ,drug-deprivation bad 
hardly as yet commenced, already 
Dan’s eondition had grown 80 serious

him for a moment. 


‘ suffering. 


At breakfast time Bradford had 
food brought, and ate a little while 
Dan, shuddering with disgust, turned 
his face to the wall and moaned. 
Bradford forced him to drink plenty 


of water, and even a little spirit; but | 


nothing availed to quiet the patient’s 
From’ now on he grew 


ever more and more restless. Sweat- 


‘ing set in, with severe cramps and a 
dragging pain in the thighs and legs 


which made him writhe, howling, on 
the bed. At 7:30 Dan suddenly arose 
and ran to the window. Bradford 
caught him just in time to keep him 
from throwing himself into the alley, 
with shrieks that he was being done 
to death. 

After Bradford had dragged him 
back to bed the dope fiend grew more 
quiet, though he still kept up a more 
or less continual whining and crying. 
Toward 8 o’clock he seemed absorbed 
2a some kind of apology for thought. 
All at once he sat up in ‘bed, turned 
wis clay-colored face toward Bradford, 
and, in a hoarse voice, exglaimed : 

“Took-a here, mister! I’m hep to 
wmethin’ you'd give the world to be 
wise to. Gimme just an eight-grain 
tablet, an’ I’ll spill the info.” 

“Nothing doing,” answered Braa- 
tord firmly. “If you offered me a 
gaid mine, I wouldn't give you enough 
dope to dust a fly’s eye with.” 

“Yeh, but this ain’t a gold mine I’m 
sakkin’ about. I’m wise to all that 
about your moll—that Sylvia dame.

“What?” 5 

Bradford shot the word at him with 


| explosive force, and seized him by the 
bony shoulder. 3 


“She’s your moll, ain’t she? Sylvia 
Alden?” 

“You know about that?” 

“Sure I do!” And Dan grinned un- 
easily, while his skinny fingers drum- 
med a nervous tattoo on the bedding. 
“Legge my shoulder; you're pinchin’ 
me!” 


“What do you know?’ demanded 


“firadford, shaking him.

Bradford’s grip on the emaciated 
shoulder tightened till Dan’s face con- 
tracted with pain. 

“A frame? Two thousand?” criéd 
Bradford, in a veiee that stifled any 
opposition.

wouldn’t come back at him. THought

He groveled horribly in the twisted

exultation and importunity.

flung at him, recoiling from the aw-

“Rat!” howled Dan, in frenzy. “Rat

A heavy-fisted bangang at the door 
turned Bradford from the bed. 

“Hello! Who's there?” he s/outed 
in a shaking voice. 

“Me!” boomed one hoarse 
from the hallway. 

“Who's ‘me’?” 

“Muggs Rafferty! Yuh told me to 
blow back here in the mornin’. Well, 
I’m here. On de job, dat’s all, see?’ 

“God, Muggs, but I’m glad to see 
you!” exclaimed Bradford, flinging 
open the door. 

“Come in! I need you now, if I 
ever needed anybody in this world!” 

*“What’s de kick-up?’ demanded 
Muggs, astonished, as he stared in 
at the sick-room and observed the 
tumbled bed with the writing figure 
in it. “What's diddin’, anyhow?” 

“Lots! Come in Lere, and I’ll tell 
you.” Bradford closed the door again, 
behind the wondering Rafferty. “I’ve 
got a patient that’s gone. pipes, for 
a shot of uope. You've got to help 
me with him.” 

“Dan? Is it Dan?’ 

“Yes. You know all about the case. 
That’s what you came in for, last 
night—to wallop me for throwing 
Meiny out on his head and keeping 
Dan for treatment. ‘hings are in a 
devil of a mix. He's been off the 
hop, now, for twelve or fifteen hours, 
and he’s getting violent.” 

Bradford advaned to the side of 
the tumbled bed. Dan now lay there, 
apparently unconscious, with both 
legs drawn up and with his hands 
locked tightly over his stomach as if 
to ease some frightful, devouring 
pain. His livid skin showed a death- 
like hue. Almost no pulse beat in 
his emaciated wrist. Bradford shook 
him by the arm, but got po answer 
save a feeble groan. 


“He’s in the morphine-collapse, due 
to sudden withdrawal,” said Bradford. 
“This is serious, Muggs. I hadn’t an 
idea in the world he was taking 
enough hop to bring this on, when I 
cut him off. We've got to have a

“Why don’t you telephone for one?

on de corner o’ Prince.” 

“I can’t leave Dan, now. Beat it, 
Muggs! The drug store for yours. 
Tell ’em to get the nearest doc, in a 
hurry. All the docs I know are up 
in the Back Bay—no chance to get 
one of them in time. We've got to

stroked his grizzled beard. Muggs

“I think I do. None of them en-

pearing before me.” 

“Well, then, tell me—is there a

“Alden? Sylvia Alden? Mmmm.

“She is dere, I tell yuh!’ Muggs 
burst in. “I know it, see? I was

“Gray-blue eyes, hair parted on one 
side and drawn down at the back of 
the neck, a firm chin, rather a delib-

“Hm! There’s only one nurse at

“She might of shifted her monni-

suggested Muggs.

claimed. “Can you tell me anything

“I don’t know. Let’s

“She often wore a fine silver chain,

T oday’s Short Story 


BY GEORGE T. BYE 
Illustrated by Arlene Coyle 


John Hutchinson, the handsome 
young pharmacist, had an unusually 
irksome morning. He was alone be- 
hind the counter. His assistant was 
selfishly at home enjoying a siege of 
influenza. There was no telling how 
long he would be laid up. It would 
be bad business to have him coughing 
and sneezing in the store while pre- 
scribing sure cures for other people’s 
grippe. Hutchinson faced a long and 
arduously busy day, during which he 
would have to try to appear cheerful, 
for business’ sake—and the morning 
had been a nerve-wracking trial. 

A score of doleful people in the 
neighborhood had consulted him about 
depressing aches, chills, fevers, pim- 
ples and coated tongues. He had had 
to bandage a burned finger and take 
a baby’s temperature. A woman had 
asked if she could leave her little boy 
in the store “for a few minutes” while 
she went shopping, and during the en- 
suing two hours the energetic brat 
had knocked down an artistic display 
of talcum powder and broken a dol- 
lar’s worth of bottles.

s¢rawled a few hasty words. “Here, | 
this will be sufficient.” 

Bradford t«ok the note in a trem- 
bling hand. 

ey you, too, Muggs—” 


said he§“I can’t thank you properly, 
so I wot try. My thanks will take 
another form than words. Will you 
stay here, with the patient, til I get 
back ?” 


“Yes, after I phone my assistant 
to take my work. Yes, if it takes 


me a note or something, can’t you?” 


“Why, of course! 


And the doctor 


all day!” exclaimed the doctor. 


AT THE CORNER DRUG STORE 


(Continued Tomorrow. ) 


Complaints were made about the 
stuffiness of the telephone booth, the 
slowness of central in answering, and

pillow. “You sold me some heliotrope 
soap that’s made my dog sick,” she 
cried. “My husband says the soap 
did it, and the poor dog’s sense of 
smell is ruined. He won't eat a bite. 
He just whimpers all day and night. 
Now you just have to give me some- 
thing to kill that heliotrope perfume, 
so he can smell again, and enjoy his 
food. And you oughtn’t charge a 
cent.’”’ 

But this girl was consolation for the 
whole miserable morning. Hutchinson 
rejoiced that he was alone in the 
store and that no one would see how 
attentive he was to this lovely cus- 


tomer. 


girl stammered, looking down. 


“No; but I'll de all right,” Hutch- 
inson assured helpfully. “You just 
whisper what you want—and don’t 
think anything more about it.” He at 
once leaned over the counter, assum- 
ing an expression that seemed proof 
against smiles. The _ girl, blushing 
pwk and fussing with her gloved fin- 
gers on the counter, finally whispered 
nervously in Hutchinson’s sympathetic 
ear. The whispering was a conces- 
sion to modesty. ‘There was not a 
third person in the store to overhear a 
shout. 

“I understand,” gravely remarked 
John. “Just a minute. Take this 


fix you up in no time.” 
“Oh,” protested’ the girl, “it’s for

“H-h-have you a lady clerk?” | 


one woman popped frantically out 
of the booth waving a $2U bill and 
demanding change instantly as central 
had her number and*wanted the nick- 
el. Hutchinson had to run a half 
block to a grocery to get the bill 
changed, while six customers waited 
in his store. 

To round out the dreadful morning 
an irritable woman appeared with a 


trembling little dog carried on a silk ' 


a little boy.” 

“Well, it’s what is needed. Aren’t 
you new in the neighborhood? You 
must come in often.” 

‘Tbanks,” the girl smiled bewitch- 
ingly. “I'll tell my husband ‘about 
this place. He usually buys this sort 
of thing.” 

The door closed. Hutchinson crack- 
ed his knuckles on the counter. 

“A druggist’s luck!” he groaned.

Pleased. 


BY C. E. BAKER. 

Macon, Ga., January 3.—(Spccial.) 
With a record of five victories out of 
six games played, four of these being 
gained the past week through a‘road 
trip into south Georgia and Florida. 
the Mercer university basketball team 
‘Tuesday afternoon resumed practice in 
the new city auditorium by way of 
preparation for the game here Satur-| 
day night with Georgia Tech, the first 


intercollegiate basketball encounter of ed 


the season in Macon and also the 
initial college battle for the Baptist 
quintet. 

Returning to the city Sutiday after- 
nuon a little the worse for wear and 
tear that is received as a result of 
playing four games on_ successive 
nights against teams of unknown 
ability and with the tiresome traveling 
incurred the players and Coach Cody 
were the recipients of many warm 


congratulations from Macon fans and! 


Mereer supparters Sunday night and 
all of yesterday. Coach Cody is wear- 
ing an especially broad smile over the 
outeome of the trip and the develop- 
went gained by his athletes. 

The former Vanderbilt star found 
out many things about his men on the 
trip that he never could have learned 
in days/and days of practice. He was 
ssarm it his praise of,every member of 
the team. In MecWillians, a_substi- 
tute guard who took Captain 
“Smokey” Harper’s place in one or 
two battles, he feels that he has a 
siar of the first magnitude. Specula- 
tion is rife over the coming indoor af- 
fair Saturday with the Tech Yellow 


Jackets, 
Locals Look Good. 

The Atiantans, according to best re- 
ports, have one of the most furmidable 
fires in the south this season and a 
vietory for -Mercer will be quite a 
feather in the local collegiaus cap, 
‘The indoor “Golden Tornado,” let by 
Ifead Coach W. A. Alexander, is com- 
ing to Macon with a desire for te 
venge, as the Mercerians trimmed the 
Jackets in both games last season in 
Atlanta, 20 to 19, and in Macon, 41 
to 18. The visitors have practically 
the same team as Jast year and with 
the one year’s experience should prove 
2 formidable opponent for any crew. 
{t will be remembered that the Jack- 
ets played in the semi-finals of the 
S. 1. A. A. tournament in Atlanta last 
March and that they made one of the 
best impressions of all the teams en- 
tered for cage horfors. 

Macon fans are already beginning 
to expect much of the Cody maclime 
for the campaign and a record ‘crowd 
is confidently expected Saturday night. 
Macon has a reputation of being one 
of the best cities in the south for 
patronizing basketball encounters and 
the game with Tech has already gen- 


ered unusual enthusiasm. <a much

Thomasville, Ga., January 3.— 
(Special.)——The score of 21 for Thom- 
asville and 8 for the composite team 
in the grand golf match played on 
the links at ‘Tallahassee yesterday

over the composite team, consisting 
of the two best players from each of 
the five teams in the Georgia-Florida

even worse defeat for them. Follow- 
ing the game at Tallahassee Judge 
Ellis, of the Florida supreme court, 
made a formal presentation to the 
Thomasville steam of the silver cup

W. & J. AND CALIFORNIA 
ARE DISAPPOINTED 


Pasadena, Cal., January 3.—Both 
still undefeated, the football teams of 
Washington and Jefferson and the 
University of California, which bat- 
tled here yesterday to a scoreless tie, 
today were recuperating from the an- 
nual east vs. west clash. 

The W. & J. warriors prepared for 
a cog, | with relaxation frem 
training. Their plans called for start- 
ing back to Washington, Pa., Thurs- 

ay. 

Coach Earl Neale, of the Presidents, 
and Coach Andy Smith, of the Bears, 
made brief comments on the result of 
the game. 

“T am entirely satisfied with the 

showing my men made,”’~-said Neale. 
“If they had had a few more breaks 
they would have won. Thé Washing- 
ton and Jefferson team ‘outplayed Cal- 
ifornia throughout and needed only a 
little Inck to prove it in the score. 
The slippery condition of the play- 
ing field was quite a handjcap to my 
team. The work of some of the of- 
ficials was far from satisfactory to 
me.” 
“My men put everything they had 
into the game,” said Smith, “but could 
not penetrate the easterners’ strong 
defense on the muddy field. I am sor- 
ry the conditions prevented Califor- 
nia from using its usual spectacular 
plays and am convinved that if the 
game had been played on a dry field, 
California would have won. I have 
nothing but praise for the Washington 
and Jefferson squad. It-is a real 
team and gave us a real battle.”

TECH PREPS 


FOR BATTLE! 


BY JOHN STATON. 

The opening of the basketball sea- 
son is getting dangerously close for 
some of us. A great many fans go 
into winter quarters as soon as the 
footbal season is over and stay there 
until the next season rolls around. It 
is best not to hibernate this season, 


fer from all indications the baskefball 
season at Tech vill be every bit as 
successful as the football. It has 
taken Tech a couple of years to get 
her bearings in the court world, but 
this year we all hope to show some 
real stuif. We've got the best mate- 
rial to work with that we've ever. had. 
We have two of the best coaches any- 
where. So why not? 

Our season opens. Saturday -with 
Mercer in Macon. And-don't think 
that Mercer hasn’t a real basketball 
team. 
year, but that doesn’t begin to. teif 
the story as to what they have this 
season. If'we might he jallowed; to 
quote Oscar Davis, an eminent. sport- 
in authority, we would ‘say. . that 
“Mercer has a perfectly lovely team 
this season.” Charley Morgan, who 
has been playing loop-the-loop all his 
life, is the guiding hand of the Bap- 
tists. He knows basketball from the 
ground up, and should make a wonder- 
ful coach. The scrap down there 
last year was something else. It

started off to be a rather even free-for- 

all, but when things warmed up good, | 

Mercer wasn’t in it. ' 
Wrecking Crew. . 

Al Staton and Bill. Fincher were 
the official wrecking crew. They 
started off playing guard, but were 
playing t:. whole floor before the 
game was over. In all Mercer used 
thirty-three men, about thirty of 
which retired. gracefully from the 
scene after collisions with my old 
protector, Bill Fincher. 

The team seems to be getting into 
pretty good shape. The porgitions 
seem to-be pretty well settled; and 
the team work is certainly improving. 
Our trouble last season was the utter 
inability of the fellows to get together. 
We had-a bunch of good individual 
players on the team, but that was all. 
As far as team wérk was concerned, 
we didn’t haye very much; that is, 
until the tourney, when we did show a 
little get-together spirit,-and finished 
third in the tourney. age 

Réal Team Work. 

This season the individual playing 

is fading out and in its stead there is 


the players, ‘That is the kind of 
stuff that .wins games. Jenks and 
Brewster have been. going strong at 
forwards, and will probably start off 
the fireworks there. ‘Matheson is a 
mighty good runner-up for either of 
them, though. For the last day or 6o 
the coaches have been alternating Al 
Staton and Joe Eckford at center. It’s 
a toss-up there and will not be de- 
cided until later in the week. At 
guard Baby Roane, Red Murphy and 
Al Staton have:shown the most stuff. 
Anyway, regardless of who plays and 
who adorns the bench, Tech will put 

strong team on the court Saturday 
night. 

P. &S.—Several members of the foot- 
ball team intend making the trip as 
an added protection. #3 


TATE-WILLS 
FIGHT AGAIN 


Portland, Ore?, January 3.—Harry 
Wills and Bill Tate, negro battlers, 
have got to do their stuff all over 
again and for nothing, the Portland 
boxing commission decided Tuesday. © 

They left thousands of disappointed 
fans flat on the lot at the Milwaukee, 
Ore., arena Monday, when Tate left 
the ring after being fouled in the first 
round. 

The commission announced their 
purses would be withheld until they 
did fight again and set the date for. 
Friday night. All the cash customers 
who paid to see the Monday fight will 
receive tickets to the next fight. 

Wills said this satisfied him. He 
said he did not deliberately foul Tate 
in violation of an agreement to break 
clean. Tate was also smarting under 
criticism that he deliberately ducked 
out te escape the Wills’ barrage of 
gloves, 


GHOST OF JOYEUSE IS

Grand Junction, Tenn., January 3.— 
Ghost of Joyeuse, owned and handled 
by R. G. Stoner, of Courtland, Miss., 
today won the all-America amateur 
ehampionship and caused the first 
surprise of the all-America field 
trials because of the fact that the win- 
ner is inexperienced and almost in 
the puppy class. 

The setter Martins Mobile, owned 
by E. A. Richards, of Saulsbury, 
Tenn., and which had a heavy lead 
for the championship at the end of 
yesterday’s trials, won second place 
and Cole’s Dan Woolton, owned by

New York and Boston are both kicking over the trade by which 
the Red: Sox exchanged Everett Scott and others for Roger Peckin- 
The story is that the Colonels, besids Peck 
and Quain and Collins, gave a wad of money. Since the unfortunate 
preak of the Giants in revealing the fact that they paid a huge sum 
for Heinie Groh the owners are chary of mentioning money, under- 
standing at last that the public is weary of money and wants sport. 

The deal has aroused tremendous howling in Boston, but that may 
be overlooked, since everything Frazee does is the signal for a howl 
up there and the only trade that would suit the Boston fans and experts 
would be Frazee for a case of bubonic plague. New York is not at 
all enthusiastic over losing Peck, one of the greatest shortstops in the 


paugh and some extras.

CLUBS LOSING 


“USELESS” MEN. . 

The’ big point of the trade is that 
all the clubs are losing men who were 
not and probably. would not be satis- 
fied. with their old teams and: who 
may fit better into new surroundings, 
Scott is one of the gamest, coldest- 
blodded, cool-headed ball players in 
the world, who never misses a2 game 
and who ulways is in condition. 

Peck really was through with New 
York, at least he had either’ to star 
and, manage the teanYor get out. With 
Peck out, it may be possible for Hug- 
gins and Barrow to keep Ruth con- 
tented and‘:in condition. There is no 
longer any secret of the fact that two 
weeks before the world’s series there 
wis acrisis in the affairs of the 
Yankees, with. Peck, Ruth and one 
or two others; almost in open revolt 
against the methods of Huggins, who 
was ill and perhaps not handling the 
team as well:as might: have been de- 
sired, .especjally, in keeping informed 
as to the condition ‘of pitchers. Nor 
is there auy denial. of the story that 
Ruth and. Peck were gtven advisory 
powers to “help” Huggins. In effect, | 
Ruth and Peck were dominating the 
team, whether officially.or not. Such 
conditions cannet- help a bail club. 
The effort. to get. Hugging out had 
strong: backing and lasted from. the 
time of his illness, when Peck took | 
command ‘and statted the team on ‘its 
way to the pennant. 

Harris, who replaces McInnis, 
ought to have been one of the best 
men. in the country. He was injured’ 
badly in. France just at the end of 
the war and was dissatisfied with the 
treatment or lack of treatment he re-| 
ceived from the Cleveland club. He 
held out and then played independent 
ball: There is fio evidence that he 
jumped or broke any contract that I 
have been-able to discova. He can 
play first or the outfield, and he 
makes Boston quite strong. 


THE 
YANKEES’ PLANS. 


It is evident that the Yankees plan 

use Ruth. as first baseman and 
the biggest sign of promise is the be- 
havior of the big fellow this winter 
and his condition. He is twenty 
pounds lighter than he was during 
the world’s series, and Jooks well, The 
sentence imposed upen him by Judge 
Landis may really prove a blessing in 
disguise, as it gives Ruth a month 
in which to practice and train as a 
first baseman, and if he ‘s so he 
will avoid losing a number of games 
while. learning. 

The worst feature of the outlook 
for baseball next: season is the -wide- 
spread dissatisfaction among players. 
A dozen of them are growling and 
threatening to hold -out, among them 
Peck, both the Meusels, Rabbit Maran- 
ville, McInnis and others. The Meu- 
sels are not dependent upon the sal- 
ary they receive and both have griev- 
ances, one because he was fined, to- 
gether with, Ruth, and the other be-

wants more money, but should re-

same and even less in order to square 
himself for his terrific slump, which 
was the chief cause of the loss of the 
pennant bys the Pirates. 

This spirit on the part of many 
players will not help baseball, which 
needs help from every one connected 
with it. 

AMERICA’S 
GOLF SUPREMACY. 


With the prospect for more and 
greater international contests in 1922 
than ever before, America’s chances 
of sweeping through to golf supremacy 
are seemingly not nearly as good as 
they were a year ago. Last year we 
managed, with some effort, to retain 
our own champiouaships, chiefly be- 
cause Miss Cecil Leitch faltered when 
she seemed to have the woman's title 
at her mercy and because none of 
the visiting British golfefs had a 
break of luck in the amateur. 

While America will send over a 
larger delegation ts contest for the 
amateur this year than last, the 
chances of: making. as strong a bid 
for both amateur and open as we did 
last year are not*so bright. 

Should Miss Leitch. return to con- 
test in the women’s championship her 
chances of winning. are much brighter. : 
Our amateur title appears quite safe, 
but the open. championship, which 
seems to be the objective of the Brit-: 
ish, is:in grave il iw epite of the 
uality ofthe’ defenders. 

If the British fafl to take the open 
at Skokie, it will be a keen disap- 
pointment, since the invaders will! 
come with the greatest array of tal-: 
ent ever assembled in such an event. 
It has been announced that. Harry | 
Vardon and James Braid wil? come, 
Vardon to revisit scenes of former 
triumphs, and on top of that comes 
word that J. H. Taylor and Sandy 
Herd will be among the invaders. 

The task of Hutchison, Barnes, et 
al., to stop that yuartet will be a 
hard one. The four alone have won 
seventeen British championships since 
1894. Vardon has won six times, 
Taylor has won five times and tied 
once, losing that to. Vardon on the 
play-off; Braid-has won five times, 
and Herd, although ranked by British 
expert opinion as the peer of the oth-

Cambridge, Mass., January 5.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Harvard athletic authorities in 
an eleventh hour attempt to complete 
the 1922 gridiron schedule have now 
turned to the University of Florida 
and Alabama university. The date of 
November ¢ still remains unfilled, and 
Graduate Treasurer Moore is experi-

North Carolina sought a game with 
Harvard, requesting a date on this 
year’s schedule. The University of the 


request. Harvard authorities made 
their conditions known to North Caro- 
lina, offering November 4. After 
considerable and unnecessary delay 
Carolina turned the invitation down. 
The date was then offered to Sewanee 
with the hope that the matter could be 
quickly settled. 

Much to the displeasure of the Har- 
vard authorities and the disgust of the 
undergraduates it was found that 
North Carolina, in turning down 
Hartford’s offer of November 4, had 
completed arrangements for a game 
with Sewanee on that date. Graduate 
Manager Moore then -went to New 
York in an effort to secure a game 
for that date, but was unsuccessful, 
In accordance with Harvard’s desire 
to meet southern universities, the date 
was today offered to Alabama andjj 
Florida. {onsiderable resentment to-! 
wards the attitude taken by Carolina 
and Sewanee has been openly express- 
ed here, it appearing for a time that 
it would -be impossible for the Crim- 


year. because of their act. Except for 
November 4 the Crimson schedule 
is net complete. 


THREE WHITE BOYS 
~ HELD‘IN ROBBERY 


Three white boys who gave their 
names.as J. S. Childs, 18; Daniel La- 
Fitte, 15, and Alfred Webb, 17, were 
being -held at Fulton tower Tuesday 
in connection with the recent robbery 
of the home. of Dr. Ed Brown, senior 
partner of Brown & Alien, druggists, 
on Laloon road. 

The boys were arrested by County 
Lieutenant of Police Oliver, who 
stated he was leading a patrol of men 
out Baloon road.,when he saw the boys 
with a large quantity of goods, alleged 
to have been stolen from the Brown 
home. They were being held in de- 
fault of $500 bond each.

JOHN WILSON. 
IS SUSPENDED 


New York, January 3.—The New 
York athletic commission, controlling 
} professional boxing, has suspended for 
an indefinite time Johnny Wilson, 
middleweight champion, and Martin 
Kililea, Wilson’s manager, for re 


pudiating a contract to box Harry 
Greb, the Pittsburg windmill, in a 
championship match at the garden 
this month, . 

Kililea is said to have notified Rick- 
ard in writing that Wilson did not in- 
tend to go through with the match, 
stating that he egreed to the match 
for the sole purpose of obtaining from 
Rickard the $35,000 ep held up 
after the Labor day fiasco between 
Wilson and Bryan Downey. Rickard 
gave Wilson the money when he signed 
articles to fight Greb. 


Andy Chaney, who claims two 
“newspaper decisions” over Feather- 
weight Champion Johnny Kilbane, wil! 
tackle one of the toughest little men 
in the ring Friday night. Babe Her- 
man, of California, a member of Jack 
Kearns’ stable, has been chosen to 
trade mitts with Chaney in a fifteen- 
round decision bout. Both men have 
been pursuing Kilbane as the head 
of the pack, and are about the best in 
the division. . : 


Alumni of Washington and Jeffer-

ON TONIGHT 


BY ROY E. WHITE. 

President L. L. Boon, of the At- 
lanta Prep league, announces that 
there will be a meeting of the league 
directors and representatives tonight 
at the Boys’ High School br iding, 
eorner Gilmer and Courtland étreets. 
The meeting is scheduled to start 
promptly at 8 o'clock and all repre- 
sentatives are urged to be present, 

There was a committee appointed 
at the last meeting to determine 
whether or ‘not the city Auditorium- 
Armory court could be secured for 
basketball. games.. This. committee is 
expected to give its report at the 
meeting tonight. It has been rumored 
around the preps that this committee 
will make a favorable report. 

If the Auditorium is secured, it has 
been planned to bave two basketball 
games the same afternoon for the ad- 
mission price of one. The same offi- 
cials will probably handle both games. 
It bas also been planned to pool all 
the gate receipts for the season and | 
divide them equally among all the | 
teams. This plan w.ll meet with the | 
approval of practically every league | 
director and will benefit the league. 

On Same Basis. 

It will put each team on the same ' 
financial basis and will add interest | 
Several of | 
the smaller teams would be forced to , 
discontinue some of the conveniences 
that go along with the basketball sea- | 
son if this plan were not adopted. 
This act will stamp the city prep 
league of Atlanta as one of the best 
prep athletic leagues in the south. 

The big advantuge in playing both 
games at the Auditorium is that the 
spectators can see them for the price 
of one and also see the smaller ‘eams 
play. In the past all the fans turned 
out to see the best game, but now 
they will have a chance of seeing both 
brands of basketball in the same aft- 
ernoon.

| From December 29 to the end of the 


New York, January 3.—Studebaker made a new high record for 
the recent upward movement during the early trading today and the 
Steel shares, under the leadership of Crucible were strong. However, 
western selling soon started and the market grew weaker than at any 
time since Jast August or when the genera! liquidation movement creat- 


\e3 ed by “frozen” loans stopped. Since then the price trend has been up- 


ward. Lower prices are expected before the end of the week. 
Today's selling in the stock market was connected with the develop 


-}ments in the Chicago banking situation, that is with the taking over 
‘of the Fort Dearborn National bank and the Fort Dearborn Trust & 


Savings. bank by George M. Reynolds and his associates in the Contin- 
ental bank and the Continental & Commercial Trust. Wall street bank- 
ers are of the belief that the situation at Chicago is local and has noth. 
ing to do with the general banking situation. They believe the situation 
out there is the same as it was-here some months ago with the Mercan- 
tile and the same.as in Canada some ten days ago when the Bank of 


: Montreal took over the Merchants, thus guaranteeing all deposits. 


Another news development of the day that had a bad effect on the 
stock market was the unexpected passing of the 3 per cent quarterly 
Kelly-Sprim ;field tire stock dividend. This stock broke over 6 points on 
the newS ,371-4. At the same time Studebaker, Asphalt and a number 
of other }tocks in which pools have recently been active, were heavy. 

With the exception of stefling the . 
market here for all foreign exchange 
was weak. In foreign banking quar- 


ters the weakness was attributed to 
year-end adjustments.

gregating $13,058,000.

’ Oil Reduction. 

While Wall street was not prepared 
for the cut of 50 cents a barrel an- 
nounced today in the price of Penn- 
sylvania crude oil from $4 to $3.50 
and which compares with the low of 
$2.25 for the year, big oil men here 
say the Standard Oil companjes have 
been out of the market for the past 
ten days, having been tipped off that 
something in the way of price reduc- 
tions were coming. From _ well-in- 
formed oil men it was learned today 
that the cut was due to a falling off 
not in the demands for gasoline and 
lubricants as much as in the high- 
class by-products which are made 
from the Pennsylvania crude alone, 
such as expensive soaps, cosmetics, 
dyestuffs, chemicals, etc; These items 
running into the hundreds, it was 
stated, mount up to a large total. To- 
day’s price cut was the first since 
the steady advance from $2.25 to $4. 

Charles M. Schwab usually has 
something interesting to say when 
he talks. Today he said that 1921 has 
taught us that prosperity can not be 
forced by legislation; that wages de- 
pend on production; that one class 
can not thrive at the expense of an- 
other; that there is no substitute for 
hard work and thrift. 

Charles Hayden, widely recognized 
as one of the best-posted men in the 
copper trade, says that the country’s 
copper surplus was reduced last year 
by 335,000,000 pounds to 516,000,000. 
He estimates domestic sales at 637,- 
000,000 pounds axd exports at 537,- 
Price cuts of from $90 to $240 on 
all models are announced for Haynes 
ears effective at once. Wall street 
expects more announcements of the 
same kind this week before the annual 
automobile shows begins this coming 
Saturday. 

Stock exchange listings for 1922 pub- 
lished today make an interesting show-

Macon, Ga., January 3.—(Special.) 
Six hundred shopmen employed at the 
Central of Georgia railroad shops in 
Macon, today voted to work five days 
a week during the month of January, 


by eighty men. 
The company, in*endeavoring to op- 


erate within its income, found it 
necessary to make a cut in operating 
expenses for January and cuts were 
ordered in every department. The em- 
ployees were given the option of ac- 
cepting a five-day.week or having a 
number of men thrown out of em-

Local Rotari 


Witness Pruning 
Of Mock Patient 


Another person was cut in two 
here Tuesday afternoon. ‘fhe habit 
of cutting people in two equal parts 
seems to be the habit of Atlanta of 
Inte. At a loeal theater a woman 
is cut in two at every performance, 
but the new addition was a man and 
a Rotarian. Members of the Kotary 
club saw the latter operation ‘Tues- 
day, and instead of being impressed 
with the seriousness of the situation, 
they all burst out laughing. 

The Tuesday afternoon orgy was 
staged at the New Year’s luncheon 


After the committee, composed of 
Kendal Weisiger, Dr. Frank Boland 
and Dr. Delos Hill, got through cut- 
ting the immolated man piecemeal, the 
would-be victim did what the woman 
at Lowe’s vaudeville does daily. He 
got up smiling and walked off in per- 
fect health. 3 

The operation started by the bring- 
ing on the ball room floor of full op- 
erating room equipment, anaesthetic 
machine, instrument tables, aseptic 
basins and instruments, including ham- 
mers, saws and ehisels. The audience 
gasped. Then came. the committee, 
accompanied by th boni fide train- 
ed nurses from local hospitals. 

The first thing removed from the 
patient was the cigar he was smoking. 
As the ether was being applied one 
of the doctors announced that the am- 
bulance was waiting downstairs when- 
ever the patient squirmed and gave a 
muffled yell “that he didn’t want 
any operation.” 

Financial adhesions were first re- 
moved; then the fuss pocket and the 
leather lungs—too much gab. It was 
announced that the patient had been 
coming late to luncheons, and so the 
doctors removed the terrapin from the 
abdominal cavity. It was said that 
the patient butted in places where 


‘he wasn’t wanted, so the doctors re-! 


moved the “little billy goat.” It was 
said that he was a chronic kicker at 
the food served. at the club’s lunch- 
eons, so the doctors removed his feet. 
They X-rayed the patient and because 
a member accused him of being a 
typical bonehead, the doctors removed 
the offending bones. They then said 
he was entirely well and a “simon- 
pure Rotarian.” 

At the next meeting of the club, it 
was announced, there will be an op- 
eration in which part of the pep of 
those who have an abundance of en- 
thusiasm will be grafted into those 
who show a lack of it. 

Tuesday’s meeting was addressed on 
“Boys” by Willis A. Sutton, superin- 
tendent of schools, who urged the 
club to take more interest in boys who 
will be the future men of the city.

IN SENATE AT ONCE 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 


igh Hotel. 

Washington, January 3.—(By Con- 
stitution sed Wire. ?—Administra- 
tion leaders today are bending every 
effort to have Governor Sproul, of 
Pennsylvania, forego his determina- 
tion to wait until the regular Novem- 
ber elections to capture the Penrose 
seat, and to resign at once and have 
the lieutenant governor appoint him 
to the vacancy. In a_ conversation 
over the telephone with Senator Wat- 
son, of Indiana, speaking from the 
white house, the governor promised to 
give it serious consideration. The 
prospect, therefore, is that Sproul, 
who is determined to permanently suc- 
ceed Penrose, may determine to come 
to the senate at once in deference 
to thew ishes of President Harding 
and other of the old, guard leaders, 
They consider the exigencies of party 
politics as well as the perilous con- 
dition of the Newberry strength on the 
republican side demand at once a 
virile administration fighter to help 
it extricate itself from a threatened 
crisis.

Miller and Bradford have been the 
happy recipients of highest praise 
from the local critics. They have a 
skit that is entirely out of the or- 
dinary and sure to afford a pleas- 
ant quarter of an hour’s entertain-

IN SEXTON CAS 


| In 


Macon, Ga., January 3.—<Special.) 

igation of the disappearance 
of A. P. Sexton, of Royston, whose 
blood-spotted car was found abandon- 
ed near a local bridge, Saturday night, 
following the receipt of a post card by 
the police, signed “thief,” stating Sex- 
ton had been murdered and .his body 
thrown in the swamps near Macon, 
took an-entirely new turn today whe 
officers claimed to have learned at a 
local filling station that Sexton’s .au- 
tomobile had been seen there last Fri- 
day afternoon, ‘ 

A negro workman at the filling sta- 
tion is said to have identified the car 
as that belonging to Sexton by means 
of a spare tire that he transferred 
from another car to the rack in the 
rear of the Sexton machine. This tire 
had been replaced on one of the wheels 
and the old tire placed in the rack. 

The other car was driven by two 
white men. The police are now try- 
ing to locate the negro who is said 
to have driven the Sexton machine, 
and the two white men in the other au- 
tomobile. In the meantime, parties 
are seagching the swamps between 
Macon and Madison for Sexton's body. 

Alex Stephens, a negro employee at 
the street car barns here, told the 
the police teday that a drunken white 
man came to him at the barn about 
two blocks from the Spring street 
bridge, where Sexten’s abandoned car 
was found last Saturday morning, and 
told him ‘that a man was being mur- 
dered on the river span. 

Stephens said he paid no attention 
to the man. That was about, two 
o’clock Saturday morning, some hours 
before the abandoned car was found. 
Relatives and friends of the missing 


after. searching the highway from 
Reyston to Macon, left this morning 
to meet another searching party, which 
had left Royston. Si oe 

The two parties will probably meet 
in Athens and work back over the 
road again. It is expected that: the 
party that left Monday will return 
here sometime tomorrow. 


Christian Science 
Publishing Society 
Trustee Is Named 


Boston, January 3.—Judge Cros- 
by, of the supreme .court, announced 
today that he would fermally appoint 
Fred M,. Lamson, vice president of 
the Old Colony Trust company, of 
this city, and a Christian Scientist, 
as temporary trustee to take charge 
of the affairs of the Christian Sci- 
ence Publishing society, as soon as 
certain details as to his duties have 
been defined. The trustees of the 


of the First Church of Christ, Scient- 
ist, had informed the eourt that they 
had agreed upon Mr. Lamson. 

Judge Crosby decided that Mr. 
Lamson should be designated as tem- 
porary trustee, rather than temporary 
receiver, as had been suggested by 
counsel for the trustees, but that he 
should be responsible te the court and 
Should not exercise powers given by 
Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy to the trus- 
tees under her deed of trust. He will 
hold his post until the court has de- 
termined after further hearings 
whether the directors acted in good 
faith in removing Herbert W. Eusta- 
cem and Paul Harvey as trustees, and 
has acted on various other matters 
before the court. 

Counsel for John V. Dittemore, 
who is contesting his removal from 
the board of directors, also agreed to 
the appointment of Mr. Lamson. 


KLAN CASEISSET  . 
FOR. HEARING TODAY 


According to the calendar prepared 
Tuesday by John S. Holiday, deputy 
clerk of Fulton superior court, a civil 
su against the Ku Klux Klan 
brought by Z. R. Upchurch, is set for 
hearing before Judge John T. Pendle- 
ton Wednesday. 

This suit to be heard Wednesday 
was brought by Z. R. Upchurch 
against Edward Young Clarke and 
Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler, officials of the 
klan, in which Upchurch is seeking 
to prevent the transfer of property 
by Mrs. Tyler to Mrs. Dorris Man- 
ning Jett. The suit was filed De- 
cember 16 and Upchurch alleges Mrs. 
Tyler has transferred ‘most of her 
property to Mrs. Jett in order to 
keep him from recovering on a suit 
previously brought by him against 
Mr. Clarke and: Mrs. Tyler in which 
he cailed for an accounting between 
them. ya 

This is the first of the suits against 
the klan to be set for trial.

Is Named Judge 
Ot Juvenile Court 


Becomes First Woman Jurist 


Office At Once. 


Dublin, Ga., January 3.—(Special.) 
Mrs. O. L. Anderson, prominent Dub- 
lin woman and wife of a well-known 
railroad official, late this afternoon 
was informed of her appointment as 
juvenile court judge by Judge J. L. 
Kent, of the Laurens superior court. 


The appointee was not an applicant 
for the place and did not know, until 
informed, that her name was being 
considered ag the first woman judge 
in Georgia. 

This appointment means that Lan- 
rens county will havea tribunal for 
tryi.g of cases of minors charged with 
oftenses of the law and who often are 
thrown into prison, where conditions 
are not very conducive for .good to 
children in a formative period of life. 

The appointment of such an offi- 
cial here is thought to have been the 
result .of agitation and interest of 
local women in certain cases recently 
where minor children were jailed on 
charges of infractions of the law. 

Only a few weeks ago, a 14-year-old | 
boy was found guilty of murdering his 
17-year-old playmate and seritenced to 
life imprisonment. Mrs. Anderson 
will assume her new duties imme- 
diately.

OREAM CLEARS A 
STUFFEDAP HEAD 


Instantly Opens Every Air 
Passage—Clears 
Throat. 


Ga., 


If your nostrils are clogged and your 
head is stuffed because of nasty ca- 
tarrh or a cold, apply a little pure, 
antiseptic cream into your nostrils, It 
penetrates through every air passage, 
soothing and healing swollen, inflamed 
membranes and you get instant relief. 

Try this. Get a small bottle of 
Ely’s Cream Balm at any drug store. 
Your clogged nostrils open right up; 
your head is clear; no more hawking 
or snuffling. Count fifty: All the 
stuffiness, dryness, struggling for 
‘breath is gone. You feel fine.—(adv.)
