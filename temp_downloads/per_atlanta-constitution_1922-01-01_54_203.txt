discussions, the delegates of the Unit- 
ed States. Japan, Great Britain, 
France, Italy and the Netherlands, 
put their heads together and came to 
a general accord over the cable. prob- 
lem. 

Under the proposal, yet to be for- 
mally accepted, the United States 
would. secure title to the Yap-Guam 


{ cable, Great Britain would secure the 


Yap-Shanghai line, and the Nether- 

lands would become possessed of the

The section would:expand, but not 
invalidate, the agreement previously

finally end, the concroversy over Yap 
and its cables which began at Ver- 
sailles. : 

Of the expert subcommittee, three 
reached agreements: and a fourth re- 
ported substantial progress. 

The subcommitte on aireraft com- 
pleted a report said to recommend 
against any present attempt at limi-

against any restrictions that might 
curtail commercial aerial development. 

Drafting of the Root resolution on

completed by another subcommittee. 
Only minor verbal changes were made 
in the original proposal to reaffirm 
existing principles of international law 
in respect to search and seizure,

There was the usual ringing of bells

BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Bureau, 
Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, December 31.—(By 
Constitution Leased Wire.) —An 
analysis of formal statements given 
The Atlanta Constitution today «by 
representative officials of the govern- 
ment, including Secretary of the 
Treasury A. W. Mellon, Governor 
G. Harding, of the federal re- 
serve system; Eugene Myer, Jr., of the 
War Finance corporation, and S-e P. 
Gilbert, undersecretary of the treas- 
ury, indicate a genuine belief in the 
restoration of business ‘activity and 
an optimistic outlook for the country 
in general during the coming year of 
1922 

a as the father, whose cimeelaall 
instinct stands guardian over and 
directs the destiny of youth, thesé 
government officials, ag representa- 
tives of the peaple, share the respon- 
sibility of the nation, and expressed 
themselves with all hope and belief in 
the ability of the New Year to bring 
forth intrinsic stability out of the 
past disrupted economic conditions of 
the country, following war. 

Mellon Voices Keynote. 

The statement to The Constitution 
from Secretary Mellon that “the re- 
covery in the general situation during 
the past fine or ten months has been 
greater than anyone had reason to ex- 
pect a year ago, and it gives some in- 
dex to the prospects of the future,” 
is in a word*the sentiment expressed 
by all. 

Continuing, the secretary of the 
treasury ‘said : , 

“The country’s financial condition 
has proved to be sound, and the ‘bank- 
ing situation has greatly improved: 
the reserve percentage of the federal 
reserve banks has risen from but lit- 


tle over 40 per cent to over 70 per

FOR CITY MARKET 


Petition for Restraining 
Order Is Filed by W. 
Paul Carpenter and Al- 
dine Chambers. 


JUDGE FIXES HEARING 
FOR MONDAY MORNING 


Illegal Expenditure of 
Maney and Attempt to 
Evade the Law Charged 
in Petition. 


Mayor Key, members of council, the 
aldermanic board and other city offi- 
cial were temporarily enjoined Sat- 
urday by Judge George L. Bell, of Ful- 
ton county superior court, from ex- 
pending $42,500 in the purchase of a 
lot on Edgewood avenue, on which it 
is planned to erect a municipal market. 

Hearing on this petition which was 
filed by Aldine Chambers and W. Paul 
Carpenter, for C. A. Peacock, has 
been set for 10 o’clock Monday morn- 
ing before Judge Bell. 


The $42,500, asked by friends of the 
market, which is half of the entire’ 
sum needed, had been voted by council 
and passed by the aldermanic board. 
Final action was dela fed, however, by 
notice of a motion to reconsider and 
the board was scheduled to meet Mon- 

to. take: the final voteon 
the appropriation. “It was confidently 
expected that the fund would be voted 
and that the mayor Would sign at 
once. Unless the injunctian petition 
is decided upon before the board meets 
it will be the last chance for the pres- 
ent council to pass the appropriation 
since a new council goes in Monday 
night and the ‘entire matter would 
have to be considered again, without 
any reference to what was done in 
1921, 

Reasons for Injunction. 

Permanent injunction is asked on 
the grounds that the city, is undertak- 
ing to spend illegally a large sum of 
money belonging to the tagpayers for 
a wasteful purpose. 

The suit sets out that the mayor 
appointed a committee composed of 
some members of-council and promi- 
nent citizens not belonging to that 
body who compose a committe on 
municipal research, which committee 
has agitated the market question to 
such an extent that it has been inti- 
mated that a member thereof, who is a 
real estate dealer, was financially in- 


terested in selling a tot to the city 
on which to build a market. 


; 


‘These intimations became so pro-! 


nounced that one member of the com- 


mittee resigned under pressure.” 

It is alleged in the petition that this 
committee which is known as the com- 
mittee on municipal research has

25,000,000 bottles of Tanlac in the

Mr. Willis believes that this record 
enables him to declare thac more Tan- 
lac has been sold than any other med- 
icine that the world has ever known 
in the same length of time. 


$1,000,000 Net Earnings. 


In 1920, net earnings returned for 
taxes, amounted to apprexinately $1, 
000,000. ®Naturally this development 
and the magnitude of the business Mr. 
Willis and Mr, McDuffie transacted 
attracted eastern capital. The possi- 
bilities seem unlimited and -Saturday 
they sold to a group of capitalists 
represented by E. K. Hutton & Co., 
one of the» largest brokerage firms 
operating on Wall street. 

“The parent of $2,000,000 in cash 
carries ,000 shares of the common 
stock, with 10,000 shares outstandin 
on the New York curb sxthanse, Said 
Willis. 

“We have confined our operations 
to the United States, Canada and 
Mexico, but the purchasers’ plan to 
extend these operations in the next 
few months to England and South 
America and finally throughout: the 
civilized world.” 

The present organization wil] re- 
main practically intact. Mr. MecDuf- 
fie will remain. with the company, al- 
though he elosed out his stock hold- 
ings along with those of Mr. Willis. 
“Personally I don’t see how the com- 
pony could get along without. Mr. 
McDuffie,” said Mr. Willis. “He has 
been invaluable. to me, not only as a 
lawyer, but as organizer, executive 
and companion.”

McDuffie, Miss Crumley and the de- 
partment heads, E. C, Harris, of the 
contracting department; Gilbert Jobn- 
son, Joseph Ps Babb and Charles J. 
Kelly, of the advertising department ; 
L. R. Minor, of the copysdepartment ;

In speaking of his business career, 
Mr. Willis said that he wishéed to pay

Ohio, president of the Cooper Medi-

“I attribute! my entire success in 
this business,” he gaid “to the friend- 
ship, generosity and fair dealing of 
Mr. Cooper.” 

Mr. illis has no very definite

said something about a little winter

run over to Miami, where with Mr, 
McDuffie and L. T. Cooper,

After that, he says, his thoughts run

Relapse Thursday. 

Until a few moments before his 
death Senator Penrvse, his physician 
said, war quite comfortable, although 
he soon relapsed into unconsciousness 
and it was realized that his condition 
was desperate. 

Senator Penrose’s illness, after his 
recuperation from a long siege which 
kept him away from the senate for 
months, started early in the week with 
a bad cold. There was a change for 
the better on Wednesday, but he suf- 
fered a slight relapse Thursday. De- 
spite that, however, he was.able to 
be up and around his apartment. 

The senator’s brother, Dr. Charles 
Penrose, of Philadelphia, came here 
to see him after the first cold attack, 
but returned home Wednesday, feeling 
on the 
Penrose most of the afternoon and 
throughout the evening. 

Died at 11:30 P. M. 

Senator Penrose occupied a large 
suite on the top floor of the hotel and 
it was said that he was able to look 
out over the city this morning before 
his condition began to change for the 
worse. It was said that he was par- 
ticularly anxious to recoup his 
strength so that he could return to 
his duties next week as chairman of 
the finance committee hearing wit- 
nesses on the tariff bill. 

Dr. Adams gave the time of the 
senatof’s death at 11:30 o’clock. 

Friends of Senator Penrose said to- 
night that the sudden death recently 
of his colleague, Senator Knox, had 
been such a shock to him that it had 
affected him several ‘days ago while 
he was doing his best to shake off a 
deep cold. Like Senator Knox, he 
died suddenly, for as Dr.- Adams ex- 
plai. ed that while he knew the sena- 
tor was quite.ill, he did not anticipate 
death. )

“Charge of an attempt to evade 
the law is also made in the suit, to 
the effect that the research commit- 
tee, which is composed of council 
members and others appointed by the 
mayor, has négotiated a trade where- 
by they have agreed to buy an op- 
tion on certain adjacent property to 
the site. 

“In order to acquire a lot large 
enough to erect a market upon, even 
its proponents found it necessary to 
purchase several small tracts of land 
lying together and adjoining each 
other. The price which they agreed 
to pay is 000. The city has 
available only about half of that 
amount. To buy only half that land 
would be a complete waste, as that 
qnantity is insufficient to. carry out 
the market scheme, and unless that 
scheme could be carried out, the lot 


and then to a ve same.

ix admittedly of practically no value. 
“The charter of the city expressly 
prohibits that the mayor and general 
rouncil from expending any money 
in doing or attempting to do anything, 
that cannot be completed in the cur- 
rent year. This they pecognize. The 
courts have decided that an attempt 
to do anything by indirection that can- 
not be done direetly is also illegaf. 

“Notwithstanding that fact, the 
committee on municipal research went 
right along with its propaganda and 
negotiated a trade with the owners 
of several lots for the purchase of 
their property and agreed to pay to 
them $42,000 for certain tracts here- |. 
inafter described, and as that would 
only purchase a part of the land re- 
quired, they agreed with the owner 
of an adjacent tract to pay her $500 
for an option for six months upo’ 
her lot, with the further agreement 
that if the option were exercised the 
$500 so paid was to be credited on 
the purchase price, which was fixed 
at $43,000, 

Illegality Alleged. 

If it were not exereised. then the 
$500 belonged to the seller. In a 
way, this agreement, if adopted, is a 
purchase by the mayor and general 
council of 1921, of a piece of proper- 
ty for the sum of $33,000, $500 of 
which is provided by the council of 
1921, from the revenues of 1921, and 
obligating the mayor and_ general 
counci] of 1922 .o provide the remain- 
ing $42,500 out of the revenues for 
1922. This is clearly illegal:

Which leads us to Resolution Number Three. Thirty 
years ago the first Rogers’ store was established. Its 
= was to show the advantages of buying groceries 
or cash. To the people of this city, this was indeed an 
innovation. Like all innovations, it must prove itself. 
So sound were the fundamentals upon which it was 
founded, that shortly another store was necessary to 
serve its patrons. Then another was added, and yet an- 
other, until each succeeding year found the chain grow-

‘BY U.S. AND GERMANY 


Washington, Decsather 31.—Diplo- 
matic relations between Germany and 


the United States were resumed offi-. 
j cially iate teday, when Karl Lang, 


ciiarge d'affaires from the Berlin gov- 
ernment, presented his letters of cred- 
ence and ws received by Secretary. |. 
Hughes, 

The German charge presented -fis 
credentials to Mr. Hughes at 2:30 
oclock. and. at that exact moment 
were resumed the diplomatic relations 
which have been broken since Febru- 
ary 3, 1917. when Count von Bern- 
storff, the German ambassador here, 
was handed his passports. 

The reception by Secretary Hughes 
of Herr Lang was rather, an untisual 
ineident, in that Mr. Lang arrived in 
Washington only last Wednesday, and 
it has not: been customary for new 
envoys to present their credentials j 
so short a period of time after arriv- 
The haste to have Mr. Lang rec- 
ognized as Germany's official diplo- 
matic representative was occasioned 
by his desire, te be received with other 
members of the diplomatic corps by 
President Harding at the New Year's 
reception next Monday. In accord- 
pnce with that desire, state depart- 
ment. officials arranged an audience 
with the secretary today and it is ex- 
pected Mr. Lang will be received with 
the other diplomats by President 
Harding on New Year's Day. 

The new Austrian charge, Edgar A. 
G. Prochnik, also will be among those 
to be greeted by President Harding at 
his reception.

looking after Austrian interests in an | 


| unofficial capacity, presented his cre- 
dentials as Austrian charge to Secre- 
tary Hughes early this week.

expressed by Mr. Neel, when he said 
that Georgia must develop an ade-

‘of transportationg which will enable 
Georgia products to oe marketed with- 
out the present high freight costs, 
and that the only means which will,

us far, if outward manifestations 
rare taken as a. guide, the future con- 
-ference question has been one of thé} 
least clearly defined of. all the issues 
considered here. Most of the delegates | 
believed. they can see the end of their 
labors in connection with both arma- 
ment and the Far Kast, ..but none 
‘seems to: Bave a clear idea of what 
action is likely fo be taken in the di- 
‘rection of.a reconvening of the powers } 
‘to diseuss world problems. 


When the president's suggestion for 
a continuing series of international 
gatherings first emanated from the 
white house early in the arms n 
tiations, it was said by high admin 
tration: officials that the plan might 
be regarded as a stepping stone'to an 
“association of nations.” Mr. Hard- 
ing, it was declared, would be great- 
ly disappointed if no agreement for 
fature meetings came out of the 
Washington eonversations, 

Later Developments. 

‘At that stage of the conference, 
when definite settlements appeared 
likely in regard to all classes of naval 
armament as well as all the troubled 
problems of the Far Hast, the sugges- 
tion fourtld support in practically every 
one of the foreign delegations. It was 
agreed that some action to fulfill the 
president’s desires seemed likely as 
soon as the primary purposes of the 
conference were attained. 


Developments since, however, have 
considerably beclouded the prospect. 
Failure to agree on submarines and 
auxiliary craft, and obstacles encoun- 
tered in the Far Eastern negotiations 
are conceded to have presented @ some- 
what changed ‘situation. 


Upon highest authority, it now is 
said that the American delegation 
sees no reason to plan a future meet- 
ing to discuss auxiliary naval arma- 
ment until there has been unmistak- 
able evidence of a charge of attitude

train and nobody is accompanying 
ine. Things have come to.such a 
pass in this country that if a man is 
supposed to have money he cannot be 
courteous to a woman without being 
accused of matrimonial intentions. 

“My wife died three years ago. 
but her death did not eliminate my 
many friends among women from 
my life or rélieve me of the respon- 
sibility incumbent upon every gen- 
tleman of being courteous to women. 

“IT met the lady whom gossip is 
connecting with me in 1918, She 
was chief sponsor on Colonel Van 
Zant’s staff at the Reunion of Con- 
federate Veterans. She also was a 
delegate to a convention in Geneva 
in 1920 and -is a cultured, charming 
woman. 

“At the convention of the League 
of Women Voters at Atlanta in 1920, 
I entertained 102 women at lunch- 
eon’ and have always believed that 
lady visitors sHould be treated with 
the utmost courtesy. But I am afraid 
to take a lady home from church any 
more lest I become an object of idle 
gossip.

“When my good brothers went to 
my office on my birthday and learned 
that I had left for California they 
evidently were surprised ‘that I had 
not given notice of my intentions, 
but here is the wire they sent me,” 
he added, handing over the telegram 
which read, “Loving congratulations. 
May’ you live to enjoy many more 
years of usefulness to the world and 
joy to your loved ones.’ 

“The best usefulness I have given 
to the world was to lubricate dry 
throats with Coca-Cola, ‘for there is.

OPTIMISTIC ON 1922

sober conviction that basic financial 
conditions in the country are very 
much better today than they were 
twelve months ago. “There are many 
surface indications which bear out 
tnis statement, and those who know 
the general situation appreciate this 
fact,” he said, thereby lending an op- 
timistic hue to the business outlook 
for 1922 

Governor Harding expressed the 
opinion that the outlook for the farm- 
ers is more hopeful than appears on 
the face. 

“They have, no doubt, been and will 
continue to be benefited through the 
activities of the War Finance corpora- 
tion, which although it can not make 
direct loans to individuals. is redis- 
counting paper for banks which be- 
cause of long maturity is not eligible 
for rediscount with the federal reserve 
banks,” he stated. 

Importance of Cotton. 

Bearing more directly on the outlook 
for improved conditions during the 
New Year in the south, Eugene Myer. 
Jr., stated that the policy of the War 
Finance corporation, in | recognizing 
the importance of cotton. upon the 
business of the country and its will- 
ingness to see that the farmers ob-« 
tained a fair price for the product 
would play an important part/in the 
restoration of normalcy in thdse re- 
gions. \ 

He stated that the corporation 
would actively assist in making condi- 
tions improve to the fullest extent.\ 

Mr. Meyer said: 

“Nineteen twenty-one is pai 
more hopefully than it began for ‘the 
south and for the country as a whole. 
The year just passed will always stand 
forth as one of the most distressing 
and gifficult periods which the United 
States and.the rest.of the world has 
had to exneriénee, but I

x believe that there is no one fac- 
tor in the whole economic structure 
fof the world that is nwre mmportant 
than cotton. It inyolves the welfare 
of 20 many states and so many mil- 
 fions.of people that it is inconceivable 
to imagine the United States prosper- 


‘ous if the cotton producers are in dis- 


tress. The consuming puwer of the 


‘southern states is no less important 


than their producing power, and the 
north and the west cnn not be prosper- 
ous nor can the countries from which 
we import large quantities of commod- 
ities be prosperous with the buying

lesson of the last year should be an 
understanding of the interrelation of 
all activities and the common interest 
that we have in each other’s welfare 
at home and abroad. I believe that we 
may look forward. to a happier and 
more prosperous new year. 
Congressman Larsen, of Georgia, 
expressed the feeling that some hope 
for restoration of normal conditions in 
1922 is found in the attitude of con- 
gress to lessen the burdens of taxa- 
tion. His advice was: Hold fast and 


‘stick to the job—conditions are on 


the right road and may not be long 
delayed.

which h:s seen this much progress

ness and industry on a peace-time 
basis, through the operation of natu-

1922 TO SEE 
RECUPERATION. 

W ashington, December 31 —(By the 
Associate * Press.)—Much of promise 
in the new year is seen by Secretaries 
Hoover and Weeks, who, in statements 
issued tonight, declared the American 
people could look forward -into 1922 
as a year of recuperation. 


“Rediscount rates of Mderal reserve 
banks have fallen ftom 7 per cent to | 
2 per cent in the financial centers, 

and ‘interest rates generally are moving 
toward a lower level. The treasury 
on its part has made substantial prog- 
ress in the refunding of the short- 
dated debt and has already succeeded 
in bringing #bout a better distribution 
of the early maturities of the debt. 
About $700,000,000 of the Victory 
Liberty loan has heen refunded into 
later maturities, the Victory notes out- 
standing have been reduced to about 
$3,500,000,000 and the treasufy certifi- 


adjustment of- 1921,” said Secretary 


“Considering that we have. gone

Prominent characteristic of land val- 
“mes in Atlanta during the past year's 
ns, Mr. Wight declared Sat- 
urday in peer vl te real estate con- 
. ditions for 1921. 


“The year 1921 was marked by 


‘violent changes in commodity val-. 


: Mr. Wight said. “However, 
am real estate has had very little fluctua- 
t 

“During the past year of deflation, 
there are several characteristics that 
stand out. In a discussion of the 
market during 1924, somé distinction 
should be made between land and im- 
— rovements. ‘The principal inflation 

the real estate market was in the 
cost of improvements. Building costs, 
@uring the inflated period, arose to 
unprecedented height. These _ costs 
maturally began to drop along with 
the general decline in all commodi- 


ties. 
Difference in Price. 


“It is true, however, that the en- 
tire difference in the selling frrice 


| 
of a home today compared with two 


years ago is equivalent to the dif- 
ference in the cost of building the 
house. There has been se deflation 
in the value of a residence lot, be- 
cause there never was oo inflation. 

‘The outstanding resuit of lowered 
building costs this year has been a 
large increase in the number of resi- 
dences built. Approximately 1,200 
homes were built in 1921. That rec- 
ord exceeds the number built an 
year since 1910. That has been so 
beneficial to the city in relieving our 
housing shortage, which is still a mat- 
ter to be reckoned with. Authori- 
ties have issued figures to show that 
we are still 5,000 homes short of 
our normal needs. 


“A prominent characteristic of land 
values in 1921 was the marked stabil- 
ity. Except in isolated cases, there 
has been little variations in sales com- 
pared with 1920. Prices have sur-; 
prised students of valves in the way 
they have held up 


“Downtown values have shown no 
effects of the depression that has 
marked other commodities. During 
the past year a lot on’ Whitehall 
street, between Alabama and Hunter 
street, sold for $8,000 a front foot. 
“hich is the est figure that an in- 
side lot has brought on the street. 
On Peachtree street between Auburn 
avenue and the Candler building, a lot 
sold this year for $7.000. per front 
foot. This‘ compares favorably with 
a more desirable lot on Peachtree 
street. near Five Points, which sold 
in 1920 at $8.500 per front foot. 
re is the record price for an in- 

«e lot on Peachtree street. . In pass- 
iar. it is worthy of note that only 
five wroperties, on the east side of 
Peachtree street hetween the Candler 
building Points, ~ have

Lack of Inflation. 

“There was a marked lack of 
flation in downtown property during 
the boom period. The increase in 
rental values was not followed by 
sales on an inflated basis. This is 


is not very much land left 
available for cutting up into bome 


2 principal reason for the strength | si 


shown in downtown values. 

has always been a reserve buying pow- 
er ready to buy business property 
when it is offered at a market price. 
An example of this was shown this 
year in ‘the sale of an improved 
lot on Peachtree at Baker, at slight! 
The ok 
market has lost its attractiveness to 
2 great number of people this year, 
thereby increasing available funds for 
investments in real property. 

“A prominent feature of the year’ 
has been: the ready sale of building | 
lots. Most of these were bought for 
immediate use, as shown by the large 
number of houses built this year. This 
has been a very successful year for 
subdivisions. The demand has been 
such that a good building lot has fre- 
quently sold two or more times dur- 
ing the year at advancing prices. The 
Linw subdivision, in the Ponce 
de Leon section, has been sold out 
during the year, with gratifying re- 
sults to the owners. The Murphy 
Real Estate company has sold a large 
part of their holding in West End. 
and numerous homes have been built. 


Wonderful Demand. 


“The Peachtree Heights Park com- 
pany has had a wonderful demand 
for their wooded tracts in the Peach- 
tree section, and beautiful homes are 
springing up throughout the subdi- 
vision, The same thing applies to 
Druid Hills, where the demand for 
rood building sites is keeping a force 
of men busy opening up new streets. 
The vacant lot, despised through the 
hoom period, has come into its own 
during the past year.” 

Disenussing prospects for the real 
estate business in 1922 the president 
elect of the board said: 

“The price of houses will have to 
be in accordance with the new costs 
of building. ‘The reproduction value 


of houses is certainly quite a bit be- 
low the prices that ruled two years 


winter season is over. 
ible that renting houses will be 
iit. Yt has been several years since 
houses have been built for rent, and 
we have a real need for a larce num- 
ber of houses for rent. There is 
an especial demand for working peo-

dozen such houses have been built 
this year for rent, 
Cheaper Money in Sight. 

“With cheaper money in sight, 
there is a growing demand for invest- 
ment real estate. With the return- 
ing confidence in conditions, the new 
year should see an ine interest 
in the purchase of seasoned rent in- 
vestments. 

“And for:the premier investment— 
downtown. property under lease— 
there will be, as usual, a market for 
it at market prices. 

“A very noticeable’ stimulation 
shoulé come from expenditures under 
the $8,850,000 bond issue. It is pos- 
sible that one-half of this money 
will be expended during 1922, and 


this will have a fine effect on real 


estate conditions. In addition to this, 
it is estimated that.two million dol- 
lars will be spent for street paving, 
a gool deal of which will come from 
baby bonds.”

th- | Department Store to Be 

Established and Head- 
quarters of Chain Store 
Concern Moved Here. 


Lease of the former George Muse 
Clothing: company building, at 3, 5 
and 7 Whitehall street, by M. Rich 
and Brothers company for a term of 
freight years to Leonard-Fitzpatrick- 
Mueller, Inc., chain store concern, 
and announcement that the latter or- 
ganization will move its headquar- 
ters from Jacksonville, Fla., to At- 
lanta, were made public Saturday 
afternoon by Frank Adair, head of 


the chain stores leasing department 
of the Adair Realty and Trust com- 
pany, who handled the transaction. 

The building is lecated in the cen- 
ter of Atlanta’s shopping district and 
is one of the most choice and yalu- 
able pieces of property in the city. 
Although the amount of rental in- 
volved in the lease ‘as not been dis- 
closed by the transacting parties, it 
was learned that the sum is a large 
one, and that the rental is higher 
than the amount for which the build- 
ing was leased to the M. Rich and 
Brothers company about _ twelve 
months ago. 


Department Store Chaim. 
The  lLeonard- Fitzpateick-Mueller, 
Inc., has been running successfully a 


ment stores, with headquarters in 
Jacksonville and with stores at Mont- 
gomery,’ Mobile, Dothan and Annis- 
ton. Headquarters of the concern, 
which is highly rated in financial cir- 
cles, will be moved soon to Atlanta, 
and W. E. Leonard. president, and 
Ben Fitzpatrick, secretary and treas- 
urer, will make their homes here. 

Rich and Brothers company 
leased the property a year ago from 
the owner, J. W. Grant, with an idea 
of possibly occupying the building for 
a branch. of. their department. store. 
During Christmas week the Rich com- 
pany did a large business there with 
an assortment of toys and gifts. The 
officials of the “L.-F.-M.” stores saw 
the possibilities which the location 
offered for business, and leased it. 
The lease becomes .effective January 
1, .3922 !

, Headquarters Here. 

With a chain of stores and their 
policy of: buying in large quantities 
for cash and selling #ily for cash, the 

“L.-F.-M.” company is — peculiarly 
fitted to enter business here. Frank 
| Adair said Saturday ‘that the decision 
of the “L.-F.-M.” company -to open 
a large department store here and to 
make headquarters here is another 
| Proof of the. importance of Atlanta 
and the prosperity of the south. 

“During this period,” said Mr. 
Adair, “while so many people in dif- 
ferent sections of the country are 
crying ‘hard times,’ the decision on 
the part of this splendid firm to come 
to Atlanta is just -an evidence, of the 
faith business peonle have in our city 
and our continued prusperity. 

“Almost every day I come in con- 
tact with positive, concrete evidence 
that this ‘faith exists and that the 


improving and all this justifies me in 
predicting a srlendid increase in our 
business for: 1922.”

ARGUMENT IN CASE 
OF BOUNDARY LINE 


Attorney-General George M. Na- 
pief will leave Sunday afternoon for

appear before the United States su- 
preme court Monday to submit an 
argument for the state of Georgia in 
the boundary line litigatiog now in

The question involved is whether

qeustion: down to the present date..

Here Christmas 
Repeated Today 


Thousands Unable to See 
Performance Given Last 
Sunday. 


The Christmas pageant presented 
last Sunday will be repeated today, 
because of the request of thousands 
who were not able to gain entrance 
to the Auditorium for the perform- 
ance Christmas day. 

The pageant will begin at the same 
hour ag did the one helt last Sunday 


and will be staged in an exactly simi- | 


lar manner. Christmas carolers and 
Girl Reserves of the Y. W. C. A., who 
led the Christmas day processional, | 
will meet in Taft hall at 2:30 o'clock 
in the afternoon, as they did before. 
Choir members not wearing vestments 
will be provided with costumes. 
Will Provide Seats. 

Arrangements “have been made by 
the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce for 
bringing inmates of the Old Soldiers’ 
home, the Home for Old Women, the‘ 
Hapeville orphanage, the Decatur Or- 
phans’ home, the Hebrew orphans, the 
Georgia Child’s Home society, the 
Home for the Friendless, the Scottish 
Rite Children’s hospital, the Atlanta 
Children’s home and the wounded sol- 
diers to witness the pageant. Seats 
provided for these institutions will be 
the only ones reserved. . 

The performance will not start until 
3:30 o'clock, but the doors will close 
promptly at 3’in order that the pro- 
cessional may move without interrup- 
tion or delay from Taft hall into the 
main auditorium, 

Seating of the guests and the pro- 
viding of programs will be under the 
charge of Julian Boehm, chairman of | 
the house committee, and thirty-odd 
members representing the inter-civic 
organizations of the city, the Boy 
Scouts ,under Scout Director Jame- 
son, and the Girl Scouts. 

Henceforth the Christmas festival 
may properly be looked upon ag a 
municipal institution, for the response 
that the movement has met at the 
hands of the mayor, council, the lead- 
ers in-ciyic life and city authorities 
generaNy gives final assurance of a 
permanent place in the traditions ot 
the city. And if any encouragement 
had been lacking the enthusiastic ap- 
proval of the people of Atlanta fur- 
nished the deciding cote when the big 
Auditorium was crowded to its utmost 
capacity last Sunday. 

Opens at 3 O’Clock. 


The reception committee is especially 
urged to reach the Auditorium prior 
to 3 o'clock and serve as hosts to the 
gathering that is anticipated when! 
the New" Year's performance is staged. | 

The most generous co-operation has 
been accordeau the producing ‘commit- 
tee in the preparation and presenta- 
tion of the pageant. Voicing che ap- 
preciation of its members Miss Anna 
iugene Aiken, director of pubiicity 
for the pageant, said, “Without the 
generous support of the nrayor and 
council our enlarged undertaking 
could not have been a success; with- 
out ‘the untiring efforts of hundreds 
who aided in innumerable ways the 
task wou.d have been colossai, but 
without the whole-hearted, efficient 
and unfailing championship of the 
press in the news columns and the 
splendid editorial support the move- 
ment could never have attained the 
splendid proportions that brought 
forth the admiration of every person 
who calls Atlanta his home. There- 
fore to the newspapers of Atlanta we 
give a doubly sincere vote of thanks.” 


School of Oratory. 


The recular winter term of the At- 
lanta School of Oratory and Expres- 
sion, to be held in its studio in the 
Baptist Tabernacle, will open Monday, 
January 2, 1922, it is announced. 


Classes will be under supervision of

FRUITS OF “ISOLATION.” 

In the course of a powerful ad- 
dress before a gathering of Tennes- 
see democrats, on December 28, 
Cordell Hull, chairman of the dem- 
ocratic national committee, made a 
resounding attack upon the repub- 
-Hean policy of “isolation,” and 
painted a vivid word picture of 
what the application of that prin- 
ciple has cost the Americampeople. 
‘He cited the fact that, as every 
well-informed citizen remembers, 
immediately following the world 
war the banking and business and 


~ farming interests in America were 


“nointing to our tmpregnable posi- 
tion in world finaffce, commerce 
and production; to the extreme 
scarcity of foodstuffs, raw mate- 
rials and manufactures in the other 
half of the world, and predicting 
for America an uninterrupted peri- 
od of unparalleled prosperity.” 


Then, he asked, “What oc- 
curred?” 


“*‘What care we,’ they (the re- 
publican political leaders) shouted, 
‘about foreign trade, commerce 
and finance! We are a self-con- 
tained nation. We can live within 
ourselves, selling and . consuming 
our products among each other!’” 
and the result, as Mr. Hull pic- 
tures it, is indelibly impressed 
upon the memory of every living 
man and woman in -the United 
States! 


Europeans’ industries remained 
dormant because of their inability 
to procure raw materials from this 
country with which to operate; 
men, women and children, thou- 
sands upon thousands of them, not 
only suffered frum the lack of 
clothing, but literally starved be- 
cause they could not tap the Ameri- 
can stores of food; scores and 
scores of banks and business in- 
istitutions of Europe went to the 
wall and were ruined, because the 
channels of financial and commer- 
cial intercourse between the new 
world and the old world were effec- 
tively dammed. 


Concurrently depression and in- 
solvency and unemployment and 
all manner of suffering became 
general in this country because 
Europe could not buy our surplus 
raw materials, our agricultural 
crops, and excess food supplies. 


Even at this tine Europe is still 
stagnant and starving, while more 
than half of the world’s supply of 
gold is locked up in the American 
treasury, idle, doing nobody any 
good. 

And the republircan.congress and 
the republican administration has 
as yet done nothing to relieve the 
situation, nor offered a single rea- 
sonable suggestion pointing to a 
way out of the predicament! . 


This policy of “isolation” and 
aloofness from “foreign alliances’’ 
to which the republicans’ commit- 
ted the country in order to “get 
even with Wilson” by repudiating 
the Versailles peace treaty and 
league of nations covenant, has 
cost the farmers of the south $50 
on every bale _of cotton that has 
been produced since 1919; and the 
tax it has levied upon all other 
farm products, and upon industry 
and commerce, everywhere, has 
been correspondingly as great! 


And there is no means under 
God's heaven by which the mis- 
ciutef that the pepublicans have 
done can ever be undone; nor by 
which this country can ever attain 
‘its normal status of prosperity— 
leaving the human equation entire- 
ly out of the argument—until it 
assumes its place as a nation in 


the family of nations, willing to- 


help others while nelping itself and 
to co-operate with the balance of 


J the ~world. 


will be for-America and for all 
mankind! 


A CHEERFUL KEYNOTE. 

As a conservative, truthful an- 
alysis of the economic and business 
situation in the south, from the 


'| viewpoint of the farmer, and as an 


optimistic forecast of possible de- 
velopments during 1922, we com- 
mend the-article by Harvie Jordan, 
which appears elsewhere on this 
page. 


sion,” the expressions of gloom and 
‘the croaking about “hard times,” 
etc., that have been so prevalent 
during the year that has just pass- 
ed into history, it is, indeed, re- 
freshing to note the picturesque 
spirit of cheer and optimism that 
prevades this discussion by Mr. 
Jordan, who long has been recog- 
nized as one of the leading spokes- 
men of southern agriculture. 

We hope that every reader of 
The Constitution today will give 
thoughtful attention to what he 
has to say. 

He makes no effort to minimize 
nor to make light of the hardships 
the farmers have had to face dur- 
ing the last year. 

Conversely, he starts out by 
boldly declaring that 1921 has 
left a “pathway of financial 
wreckage unsurpassed among the 
farmers of the nation since the 
foundation of the republic.” 

But he would impress upon his 
readers the fact that 1921 is a 
thing of the past; that all of its 
bitter experiences are water over 
the dam; that we are now livirg 
in 1922, with the future to face, 
and that the way to make the most 
of it is to face it with courage and 
hope and confidence. 

He admonishes the farmers of 

the south to “let the watchwords 
for 1922 be economy, activity and 
determination to win;” and he 
says that if every tiller of the soil 
and every business man of the 
south—whose welfare and prosper- 
ity likewise depends upon agricul- 
ture—will buckle down to his 
work in accordance with that slo- 
gan “the economic development of 
the marvelous natural resources 
of the south along sound and sane 
methods of procedure will make 
our rehabilitation swift and per- 
manent.” 
“Deflation,” -in the opinion of 
this prognosticator, “has-run its 
course.” He says, “the dawn of 
1922 beckons the man with back- 
bone and courage to the rebuilding 
of the nation’s business;” and “the 
calamity howler in 1922” and “the 
slacker of 1918,” he puts in the 
category, neither of whom, he de- 
clares, “will be tolerated in this 
sunny southland of the courageous 
Anglo-Saxon!” 

Mr. Jordan very appropriately 
reminds his readers that “the farm- 
er’s problem is likewise the prob- 
lem of the banker and the’ mer- 
chant,” and the mental attitude to- 
ward life and the developments of 
the new year which he bespeaks 
for the farmer is to be commended 
with equal force to all other groups 
of southern citizens frrespective of 
their relative propinquity to the 
soil. 

Between them all, he truthfully 
says, “there must be the closest 
co-operation - if satisfactory 
economic results are to be achieved 
and prosperity once again be made 
to take its place among our peo- 
ple.” 


THE OLD YEAR'S GIFTS. 
The old year did not go out 
without the grace of blessing four 
the good gifts it brought the coun- 
try, along with its not unexpected 
troubles. 

For these gifts it well deserves 
the credit it is ‘getting as its vale- 
dictory is spoken. All things con- 
sidered, it has done pretty well! 
Commenting on the plentiful food 
supply in the country, as evidenced 
on Christmas Day, as well as the 
ample charities of the season, the 
New York Globe has this grateful 
summary— 


“Most Americans had enough to 
eat. Millions had too mich. There 
was food enough in the country for 
everyone. Not everyone got all that 
he needed, but that was not due 
to the inadequacy of the supply. If 
we had known how to distribute 
what we have, all of the hundred 
millions who inhabit this .land 
might have gone to bed with A 
sense of having eaten abundantly, 
if not wisely. Despite unemploy- 
ment and hard times this is the 
land of plenty.” 


And wherever there was a work- 
ing chance for that plenty in 1921, 
it did not fail. The substantials of 
life were ours. 

That is why a Georgia paper, the 
Cordele Dispatch, adds its “amen” 
to the above and says~-— 


“Thinking of all the blessings 
brought us in the past twelve 
months, We look upon Old Man 
1921 with a kindly feeling and 
co.':d wish for the good that has 
come, we might have that much of 
last year remain. So, when the 
doctor comes, let him be a sur- 
geon—one capable of finding all 
that we should not retain of the 
storms and stress of 1921, cut them 
out and away with them! But the 
good, let him bind in cherished re- 
membrance of good men and good 
women and use it to strengthen 
us for stronger battles onward and 
upward as we pass into other years 
of usefulness!” 


“This is the land of plenty.” That

THE TUGALOO PROJECT. 
Announcement by the Georgia 
Railway and Power 
which appears in the news col- 
umns of The Constitution today, 


work on the Tugaloo hydro-elec- 
tric power project have:been made 
and that construction will be re- 
sumed immediately, to be carried 
on to completion by January 1, 
1924, will be highly gratifying to 
the state. 

The Tallulah-Tugaloo river 
water power project in its entire- 
ty comprises six units, each, 
though distinct within itself, con- 
stituting a link in a continuous 
chain of power sites. 

Of these six units, the reservoirs 
of three—the Tallulah Falls, the 
Mathis-Tallulah and the Burton 
projects—are in operation, having 
a combined water wheel capacity 
of 153,000 horse-power. 

When completed, the Tugaloo 
development will add 75,000 horse- 
power to this developed capacity; 
leaving but two of the six units— 
the Seed and the Ralston projec 
—having a combined total of 52, 
500 horse-power water wheel ca- 
pacity—undeveloped. 

The completion of this entire de- 
velopment on the Tugaloo and Tal- 
lulah rivers would, therefore, pro- 
vide a grand total of 262,500 horse- 
power,.water wheel. capacity, or a 
capacity for.a total annual output 
of 801,960,000 horse-power hours, 
from this power development alone, 
which is only one of many other 
potential hydro-electric power 
sources .in Georgia. 
the significance of the develop- 
ment of the Tugaloo project in its 
bearing upon the commercial, in- 
dustrial and economic activities 
xf Georgia, is pointed out in the 
descriptive story carrying the an- 
nouncement to which  =teference 
has been made. 

Georgia is sorely in need of the 
"ditional electric energy it will 
make available; but its chief sig- 
nificance lies in the fact that it 
brings Georgia just that much 
nearer the day when not a ton of 
coal will be used for purposes of 
power development in this state, 
and when every factory, every 
commercial industry and every 
mile of railroad within reach of 
the Appalachian water-shed, from 
the Potomac to the Gulf of Mexi- 
co, will be operated by hydro-elec- 
‘ric energy. 

That day is not far distant; and 
the sooner it comes the better it 
vill be for Georgia, for the south 
and for the country as a whole. 
The Georgia Railway and Power 
company deserves, and doubtless 
will receive, not only the approval 
but the whole-souled co-operation, 
f the public. thus encouraging 
ond hastening the development of 
the power resources of Georgia to 
the maximum of their possibility 


THE HELPFUL BANKS. 
There are three banks in the 
town of Metter, Georgia, and that 
fact alone advertises the town 4s 
a live, progressive one, 

In addition to that, the banks are 
among the best advertising patrons 
of the local newspaper, The Metter 
Advertiser, their several announce- 
ments occupying from a quarter to 
a half-page in every issue. 

That helps the banks, the paper 
and the general business of the 
community, for it means that, by 
reaching out in this way for more 
business, the banks have business 
back of them. 

In this connection the Walton 
(Ga.) Tribune says— 

“The Metter banks are unusual 
in that they use large space every 
week, though as a general propo- 
sition the banks. are pretty good 
advertisers all over the state. There 
are exceptions, however, and in a 
great many places the advertising 
done by these institutions is either 
negligible or fitful and spasmodic. 
“This is a poor recommendation 
for such banks and the communi- 
ties that support them. The banks 
are the mainstays, the cog wheels 
and barometers of business and 
they never had such an opportunity 
to reach the hearts and homes of 
the people and render them invalu- 
able assistance in the way of ad- 
vice and counsel.as now, so they 
are embracing their opportunities 
for leadership.” 

The banks are among the best 
of the town-builders, and the small- 
est town that supports a bank may 
well feel that it has a business 
future. 

Bésides, it is mutual support; 
the one helps the other, while the 
money placed in the home bank is 
saved while it circulates, and helps 
the bank to tide business over in 
times of financial stringenty. The 
dollars in the bank are the working 
dollars. 


The New Year resolution is by 
no means obsolete, but there ig 
less ehance now to celebrate it. 


It seems impossible to round up 
the bandits for a disarmament 
meeting. 


By this time tle bandits should 
be well enough off to swear off in

_THE BOY AND HIS “DAD.” 
- In an article on “Age and Mod- 
ern Youth,” in Harper’s Magazine, 
Meredith Nicholson defends the 
bright, advanced youngsters of to- 
day as to the charge of parental 
disrespect, so often brought against 
them. 

It is pointed out that people ‘who 
sometimes arraign them on that 
charge don’t understand them at 
all, and so pronounce haphazard 
judgment. They are sentenced 
without going into the case— 
“without trial.” 

The point is made, by their de- 
fender, that the boy of today, in 
all. well-governed families,-is more 
the comrade of the father than the 
boy ever was, and where this is 
the status, all things work together 
for good in that household! 

Taking up the charge of less con- 
sideration in the attitude of chil- 
dren towards their parents, Mr. 
Nicholson says— 


“The fact that children don’t run 
to bring father’s. slippers as they 
used to doesn’t mean any lack of 
consideration for the parent who 
has worked hard all day to sup- 
port his family. I prefer to think 
the passing of this custom indicates 
a hope in the young mind that~fa- 


ed age, but still has a stomach not 
wholly satisfied with warmed-over 
cabbage. 

“Slippers are the symbol, the out- 
ward and visible sign of approach- 
ing senility. Father would be a 
lot better off if he forsook the old 
armchair and took the family to a 
vaudevi:ile show or a movie. When 
my 15-year-old son looks in on me 
when I’m shaving and asks, cheer- 
fully, ‘How’s the young hero feei- 
ing this morning?’ I am flattered. 
He doesn’t mean to be tmpudent; he 
is merely greeting me as though I 
were a comrade of his own age.” 

And that sort of greeting makes 
“dad” feel young again! It is like 
the challenge of the morning light 
to the dim, reminiscent chimney 
corner. 

And this spirit of comradeship 
keeps the graying fathers of today 
from hugging the chimney corner 
as of old. As a rule, they’re “good 
sports,” with the home-boys! 
Even the grandfathers nowadays 
are younger than they used to be, 
and the silver-haired grandmothers 
of the home are, for the most part, 
more active in the world’s work 
than formerly—as far as they may 
be able to assist tn it. In spirit 
they are as young as their grand- 
daughters. 

The New Day is here, with all 
sorts of changed conditions, and 
the “aging” ones must fit in with 
it as well as the young, and so 
help to keep the world’s. work 
going. 

And it’s a great, all around good 
thing that the children, who take 
their places in the world’s work 
earlier now, have more fellowship 
with father. 


THE BRIGHT SIDE. 
The cheerful outlook for the New 
Year is the product of the old in 
every progressive community that 
has worked for, and made the best 
of, whatever prosperity there has 
been. 
That is why so many optimistic 
editorials are appearing in our 
Georgia exchanges from every sec- 
tion of the state, in line with the 
following, from The Swainsboro 
Forest-Blade: | 
“We couldn't be a pessimist if we 
tried. To save our soul we cannot 
see where the people of this section 
have any cause for complaint. We 
have plenty to eat and plenty to 
wear, and’ we believe that we are 
eventually gging to pay every dol- 
lar we owe. ‘What more could peo- 
ple desire?” ‘ : 


That’s the bright, hopeful word 
that helps all around—that makes 
cther communities take stock of 
what they have to be thankful for 
and get out of the growling rut. 

If the people of every town and 
section would devote as much time 
to summing up their blessings as 
they do to counting their troubles— 
often more imaginary than real— 
the prosperity of which they dream 
would “come home to stay.” 

That would put them on the 
brighter side: They would have 
less time to worry, and more time 
to work. 


THE MOONSHINE PERIL. 

“Sixty Chicago Graves and 50 
Hospital Cots Filled by Moon- 
shine” is the headline to a Christ- 
mas celebration aftermath news 
story. 

The Cook county coroner, ac- 
cording to this story, says that 
during the year 1921 a total of 
sixty people have died in Chicago 
from alcoholism, caused by. drink- 
ing moonshine and smuggled-in 
whisky. 

Following the recent Christmas 
celebration there were fifty vic- 
tims of moonshine whisky carried 
to Chicago hospitals for treat- 
ment, some of them in a preca- 
rious condition. 

One of the sufferers was s0 
dead drunk and completely para- 
lyzed that, as the story goes on 
to say, “surgeons took ten stitches 
in his badly lacerated face and he 
did not even notice it.” Moon- 
shine whisky had him completely 
anaesthetized! 

And yet there are men who 
make a business of making and 
selling such deadly stuff,. and 
othess who are foolish

Cordell Hull Shows Result 
Of Policy of “Isolation” 


Cordell Hull, chairman of the 
democratic national committee, de- 
livered a powerful address at a 
state-wide democratic meeting in 
Nashvi.le, Tenn., on December 28, 
in which he made a striking com- 
parison between the records In of- 
fice and the policies of the two ma- 
jor political parties. 

He said in part: 
| “In order to suggest remedies for 
the present problems of the nation, 


it is most important that we shoula 
first locate the causes of our dis- 
tress. 

“After: the armistice and during 
1919, every banker and _ business 
man in America was pointing to 


our impregnable position in the 
world finance, commerce and pro: 
duction, to the extreme scarcity of 
foodstuffs, raw materials and man- 
ufactures in the other half of the 
world, and predicting for America 
an uninterrupted period of unpar- 
alleled prosperity. 


“At this crucial juncture the old 
guard republican leaders, represent- 
ing all the vicious forms of specia) 


privilege which when in control 
of the government always keeps 
one hand in the treasury and the 
other in the pockets of the peo- 
ple, planned their fight to gain con- 
trol of the government. The pro- 
ram included blind and bitter op- 
osition to most all domestic poll. 
cies of the democratic administra: 
tion and a strong demand for com- 
mercial isolation. 

- “What occurred? ‘What care we,’ 
they shouted, ‘about forelgn trade 
commerce and finance! We are & 
self-contained nation. We can live 
within ourselves, selling and con- 
suming our products among each 
other.’ Our foreign commerce then 
amounted to ten billion dollars ana 
constituted the biggest factor in 
our tiomestic prosperity, present and 
prospective. The democratic ad- 
ministration during 1919 and 1920 
solemnly warned the people against 
this blind and suicidal proposal] ana 
strenuously insisted that the nation 
must promote and maintain its for-, 
eign trade so as to afford ready 
markets for all American surpluses 
at good prices. 

Democratic Reconstruction Plan 

Killed, 

“The democratic administration. 
in the early part of 1919, formu- 
lated the soundest ahd most com- 
prehensive program of reconstruc: 
tion offered by any government fol- 
lowing the world wer. These plans 
embraced among other things, cred- 
it and other facilities to promote 
our domestic and foreign trade— 
maintaining the international. cred- 


the early return of public utilities 
to private operation, vigorous han- 
dling of the. high cost of living 
problem, the speedy demobllization 
of the army, early removal of wai 
restrictions. regulations, etc., dis- 
armament, reduction and readjust- 
ment of the system of war taxes to 
a peace basis, speedy budget and 
water-power legislation, punish- 
ment of criminal profiteering— 
these and other wise and needful 
proposals were contained in the 
democratic reconstruction program. 


“Republican leaders in contro] of 
both houses of congress, following 
the election of 1918, bent on every 


sort of pandemonium in all ow 
business, economic and social] af- 
fairs, in order to carry the election 
to follow, played cheap, narrow ana 
venomous politics at every step, de- 
feated or delayed the wonderful re- 
construction program proposed. 
deadlocked the government from 
1918 to 1920, choked and stran- 
gled our fvreign commerce unti) 
it has suffered a loss of s!x Dillion 
dol’ars within the past twelve 
months, and an almost vertica! 
slump in prices in America of 30 
to 50 per cent, and, in purchasing 
power of farm products, of 66 per 
cent, quickly followed. 


Undermine Foretgn Trade. 
“This nation had no inflation of 
money, had no uncontrollable infla- 
tion of credit. Prices in America 


should have gradually declined over 
a period of years, corresponding 
to the progress made by the work 
in catching up with production. Re- 
publican politicians, however, un- 
dermined our foreign trade struc- 
ture and it measurably collapsed, 
with the result that Europe, fail- 
ing to get our foodstuffs and raw 
materials with which to go to work, 
lost her purchasing power. which 
occurrence in turn caused a loss in 
America of our foreign markets at 
the most crucial] time. Panic con- 
ditions then rapidly spread. 


“For two years prior to March 4 
1921, republican leaders offered no 
sort of program as a remedy fo1 


post-war conditions save an anti- 
quated high tariff and the archaic 
doctrine of commercial isolation. 
Politics only, not the country’s wel- 
fare, was uppermost in their minds. 
They have no domestic program 
since taking complete control ot 
the government, except to serve 
certain groups of specail privilege 
which made large campaign con- 
tributions prior to the election. 


“The comparison of democratic 
achievements during its firsf ten 
months of power in 1913 with the 


first ten months of republican rule 
in 1921, is like comparing Mt. Ever- 
est to a mole hi'l—the former is 
filled with great constructive acts 


it, finance and exchange situation— 
cautious'y dealing with credit ex- 
pansion, suppressing. wild specula- 
tion, promoting full and peacefur 
employment of labor and capital. 


| 


and policies calculated wonderfully 
to promote the welfare and happi- 
ness of every individual; the latter 
‘is almost as blank as a sheet ot 
| uninked paper.”

What Might Have Been 


Y. JONES : 


Looking backward seems to bring 


with ity more or less acutely, a sense 
of regret. Often it is a sigh which 
comes from a sense of having lost 
something out of life. Memory is a 
picture gallery of that which is past. 
Too often, perhaps, memory’s picture 
stands out contrasted. with the picture 
which hope once pafhted of “that 
which may be.” Life itself did not 
come up to the plans and specifications 
which we had made for it. 


It is just as natural to defend one’s 


self morally as physically. As one 
faces the failures of a past year, it 
is so natural to say “If things had 
How instinctive 
it is to attribute the failures to one’s 
surroundings. There will come the 
suggestion that if I had only lived 
somewhere else, or had possessed more 
wealth with which to enrich life, or 
if people had only given me a better 
chance, and a score of other ifs. Of 
course, we all overlook the most im- 
portant point. Instead of supposing 
that my surroundings had been dif- 
ferent, what an interesting game _ it 
would be to suppose I had been dif- 
ferent. 
Cultivating an Environment. 

It is hard for us to believe the fun- 
damental truth that life, after all, is 
within and not without. It is not 
nearly so important where I am, or 
what I have, as what Iam. I do not 
mean for a moment that external 
things do not play a part in a man’s 
life, but I do mean that they should 
not play the principal part. The 
deadly danger inthe life of every man 
is to allow his environment to domi- 
nate him, instead of mastering his 
surroundings. Thé real art of life is 
like the art of agriculture. Every 
man’s environment is a field of possi- 
bilities which depends upon himself 
for cultivation. He may pass a piano 
every day, in which there is a wealth 
of harmony if he only knew how to 
‘elicit it. ‘He may be surrounded by 
the best literature of the ages, but it 
will depend upon him as to whether 
he will live in company with the spir- 
itual aristocracy of the world, or 
pass on, unconscious of their pres- 
ence. So with the people all about 
him. To a very large extent their 
lives will be a response to the call 
of his life, an answer to the appeal 
of his personality. . 


on the past year all of us will be able 
to see how at times we have poisoned 
the very atmosphere which we have 
breathed. Some word or act has in- 
jured a friendship. The pain given to 
some loved one still finds its reaction 
of suffering in your own heart. Some 
act perchance has been so mean that 
it has made the very day on which it 
| was performed distasteful. The keen 
regret, repentance, remorse, or what- 
ever we care to call it, which comes 
with the memory of the past, comes 
from a knowledge that the act which 
caused it was so useless, It might 
have been different. 
What May Be. 
All of which means that there was 


within each of us the possibility of a 
better man than the one which got ex- 
pression in life. There was a self 
which could have acted far better and 
found a life much richer and fuller and 
sweeter than the life which memory 
now recalls. Indeed it is marvelous 
to think of how many different kinds 
of people each one of us might have 
been. One might have been far worse 
than he was. The evil which was 
expressed is only an intimation of 
that which might have been. The pas- 
sion which sometimes almost masters 
us, brings for the moment the con- 
sciousness of kinship to a murderer. 
Covetousness is at times so strong 
ae we have a fellow feeling for a 
thief. 


But in looking back on a year that 


is past we can all remember those 
“better moments,” when that which 
was best within us came into. con- 
sciousness. ‘Those were times when 
the heart beat responsive to the 
noblest sentiments, and the spirit 
thrilled with the purest passions and 
the highest ideals. Appeals for right- 


like clarion calls, and we volunteered 
for service. Then like the mountain 
climber who descends into the valley, 
we seemed to descend to some lower 
ome level. Perhaps we smiled 

amefacediy, and declared that we 
were carried out of ourselves. But F 
am insisting that you were not car- 
ried out of yourself, but carried into 
what might have become your real self.

cial.)—Official Washington loves to 
‘gossip. It usually confines its gossip, 
however, to political rather than social 
scandals—or perhaps “breaches” would 
be a better or a more polite word than 
“scandals.” 

Everybody remembers how it gossip- 
ed for months before the final sever- 
ance of diplomatic relations between 
Woodrow Wilson and William J. 
Bryan— 

And how it. gossiped for months 


ardor of the silent and mysterious 
Colonel House— 

And how it gossiped for weeks in 
advance of the summary dismissal of 
Secretary of State Lansing because 
two great minds didn’t happen ‘to be 
drifting in the same channel. 


When ‘official Washington begins 
to gossip—look out! Something is 
just as surely going to happen as the 
morning sun is going to peep out from 
the east— 
Official Washington generally 
knows what it is talking about. When 
the gossip begins to mold itself into 
something tangible it is a composite 
icture of information that has leaked 
rom this source and that source, 
checked against and gluéd together— 
much as the child is expected to paste 
the dissembled picture puzzle into an 
unmistakable object. 
So much for the prelude! 

® 6.6 8 @ 


j 


Offcial Washington's gossip today is 
to the effect that a serious and proba- 
bly irrevocable breach has developed 
between President Harding and his 
premier—Secretary of State Hughes. 


And tbere is no mistake about the 
breach. 


But for the fact that Mr. Hughes 
is chairman of the international arms 
conference this might now be a re- 
cital of facts rather than speculation. 
As it is, every effort will be exerted 
to still the tongues until the proprie- 
ties can be better served, and the ef- 
forts may succeed. 


When one breathes only the vitiated 
atmosphere of politics, it it not diffi- 
cult to tell a brave lie. nor is it un- 
pardonable to make a dinner table in- 
teresting with malicious and cynical 
stories. Such things are parts of the 
play. If one doesn’t know the game 
in Washington, it is best to keep out 
of the play. 


Anyway, it is said that the differ- 
ences between Mr. Harding and Mr. 
Hughes are growing instead of dimin- 
ishing, and there is much to support 
the statement. The base of the whole 
trouble seems to be a disposition on 
the part of the white house to run the 
state department. 

It will be recalled that when Chair- 
man Hughes, speaking for the United 
States government, made his amazing 
speech at the opening of the arms 
parliament, setting forth a naval re- 
duction program for the major pow- 
ers of the world to follow, he imme- 
diately took the center of the stage in 
world diplomacy. 

President Harding took the seeming- 
ly very. generous position that the 
conference was Hughes’ show. and 
that whatever credit should come to 
the administration shou'd be wreathed 
around the head of his premier. 
The press hoys took notice, but 
smiled with a knowledze of the frail- 


and—

And the gossips were right. To 
offset the great publicity advantage 
that Secretary of State Hughes had 
scored with his naval holiday card, the - 
president personally sprung his  as- 
sociation of nations scheme. But it 
was working over an old garment, and 
nobody went wild about it. “Certain- 
ly.” said the commentators. That 
was known all the time. Least of 


all to wax enthusiastic was Secretary 


of State Hughes. He had been a 
friend of the Wilson league of nations. 
His position needed no explanat

The next step was the turning 
down by the president of Sec 
Hughes’ recommendation ‘that | 
four-power treaty be sent to the senate 
for immediate consideration as to 
ratification. The Hughes position was 
a firm one. The president’s Was 
equally as firm. And the two were 
just as parall-! as the two arms of a 
right angle. 

Then what happened? 

Secretary Hughes issued a press 
statement from the state department’ 
that the Pacifie treaty covered the 
mainland of Japan. Just one bleck 
away President Harding issued’ a 
press statement that the Pacific treaty 
did not cover the mainland of Japan. 

Another collision of ‘minds: 

And then followed a statement from 
the white house that a second int@r- 
national conference would be. called 
hefore the adjournn&nt of this con- 
ference, to be

It. was almost simultaneously given 
out by Secretary Hughes that if

powers, and that it would be best 
to ring the curtain on the present 
drama. before beginning rehearsals for

The old a of 1921 has passed 


into history leaving a pathway of 
financial wreckage unsurpassed 
among the farmers of the nation 
— the foundation of the repub- 
Cc. 


While its fateful memories will 
linger for years as the supreme 


cataclysm of the aftermath of the 
world war, the people must now 
concentrate their minds upon re- 
construction as the |young year of 
1922 unfolds its hopes and aspira- 
tions. 


The future must profit by the 


mistakes of the past.. Every man. 
must prepare to put his house in 
order and demonstrate that vic- 
tory in peace is far more to be 
desired in the forward march of 
civilization than conquerors in war. 


The cotton growers of the south 


were the first to feel the fearful 
debacle of deflation in 1920, and 
they will be the first to enjoy the 
fruits of rehabilitation in 1922. 


In the spring of 1921 the cotton 


growers found themselves smother- 
ed with an enormous oversupply of 
raw cotton and confronted with 
stagnated markets and prices far 
below the cost of production. As 
an economic solution of the prob- 
lem, the cotton acreage was heav!i- 
ly reduced and a greatly expanded 
acreage in food and feed crops was 
planted. Today southern farmers 
are more nearly on a basis of self- 
sustaining agriculture than they 
have been at any time since 1861. 


The large surplus of raw cotton 


brought over from the 1920 crop! 
is rapidly passing into the legiti- 
mate channels of aomestic and for- 
eign consumption. The crop of 
1921 is the smallest in yield since 
1895. Supplies of good, spinnable 
American cotton will be practically 
exhausted by August 1, 1922. 

The cotton mills of the world, 


especially in the United States, Ger- 
many and Japan, are rapidly re- 
turning to full-time operation and 
the textile trade outlook for Great 
Britain and other: European coun- 
tries is fast improving. 


Serious Shortage Threatened, 
These conditions forecast at this 


time a serious shortage in Ameri- 
can cotton within the next ten 
months. The liggitimate laws of 
supply and demand, due to the ab- 
sence of a surplus of raw cotton, 
will be reflected in highér values 
for the staple. The policy of cot- 
ton growers should be to strictly 
enforce cotton acreage control in 
1922 on the same basis of sound 
business prudence which was 60 
successfully exercised in 1921. Crop 
diversification should be as imper- 
ative on every farm in 1922 as it 
was In 1921. 


Exorbitant freight rates have 


created an economic barrier 
against the importation of food and 
feed supplies into the cotton belt 
to be used in the production of ex- 
cessive supplies of raw cotton to 
be sold below the cost of produc- 
tion. Food and feed. supplies im- 
ported into the fourteen cotton 
states have for years absorbed the 
full value of the cotton crop. This 
is nothing short of economic sui- 
cide. Not only should every cot- 
ton farm be made permanently self- 
sustaining, but the surplus of such 
food and feed products should be 
put into attractive marketable con- 
ditions and sold to the thirty mil- 


if you please, but a self which can 
| be eel That these intimations and 
longings are not dreams, but prophe- 
sies. That they are the outlines 
traced with a divine finger of a picture 
which may be filled out in complete- 
ness, I love those words of Goethe, 
“Our w are the presentiments 
of the capabilities which lie within 
‘us, od harbingers of that which we 

al ” a ee 


belt. 

Monopolistic Control 
With a 

the world’s raw cotton trade, and 

one-third of the nation’s population 


farmers of the south have unex- 
cellea opportunities for a more 


a sound and prosperous system of 
agriculture than. any farmers 
throughout the civilized world. 

The prompt and: effectivé solu’ 
tion of their problem lies: in the 
adoption of three fundamental eco- 
nomic principles as their guide for 
1922 and the years which lie ahead: 
first, cotton acreage control by 
planting not in excess of one-third 
of their cultivated land on edch 
farm of twenty-five acres in cot- 
ton, second, crop diversification by - 
planting che other two-thirds in 
food, feed and pasture crops; thie. 
the economic and efficient harn- 
dling, financing and marketing of 
cotton and other staple farm, prod- 
ucts through the effective organfe © 
zation of local and state-wide eo= 
operative marketing associations. . 


The agricultural and business in- 


terests of the south will rap 
forge ahead to finanelal rehabti 
tion if the banking and commercial 
interests of the cotton: belt will 
give their é¢arnest and helpful c6- 
operation with the farmers in the 
establishment and maintenance of 
the above stated platform of ten 
construction.

dollars are now available for sho

secrecy of Proceedings at Washington Has 
Given Obstructionists Powerful Weapon. 
: Harding’ s Early Interpretation of Treaty 
as Not Applying to Mainland of Japan. 
Hughes and Wilson Compared. 


BY FRANK H. SIMONDS. 

Washington, December 21.—(Special.)—In the days of the Paris 
conference we had at least one “sensation” a week, sometimes more, 
never less, Now it is strikingly characteristic of the Washington con- 
ference that up to date there has been but one thing which could by any 

. Stretch of imagination be compared to the incidents, of which the su:n- 
moning of the George Washington was but an illustration, and that was 
as the comment of President Harding upon the four-power treaty which 

° brought into the limelight what had been before but discreet gossip over 

_ . the true meaning of the language of that document. 

6 Now what was the explanation of the president’s misapprehension, 
of the country’s misapprehension, for the president’s view of the mean- 
ing of the language of the treaty, was generally held throughout the 
nation? The answer is, I think, discoverable in certain circumstances 

* im the present conference. When all is said and done it has one very 
close resemblance to the Paris conference. It is, after all, a one-man 

_ ghow and the one man is Charles E. Hughes, who has taken on for the 
‘ present international assembly substantially all of the functions of Mr. 
Wilson at Paris. 


HUGHES COMPARED 
WITH WILSON. 
The American people were indig- 
nant during and after the Paris con- 
~ ference because in their own opinion 
“they had been preventcd from seeing 
what was being done, or knowing why 
it was being done until very impor- 
tant and intricate decisions had been 
taken and documents signed and then 
were asked to accept these documents 
_with an indorsement by Mr. Wilson 
rather than with any explanation 
' which satisfied them. In a _ word, 
‘ the trouble arose primarily out of 
= the way the thing was done at Paris. 
Now the thing was done in Paris 
Sin this way: Mr.. Wilson represent- 
Sed the United States in every impor- 
tant meeting of every important com- 
nittee, he was the American repre- 
ientative, he was the American poli- 
by, he was every thing, and there was 
Wiiterally. no one who had the slight- 
“yest inkling as to what he agreed to 
‘Mor did not agree to until long after 
‘ the event, or to put the thing more 
‘exactly, he acted without regard to 
any advisers or associates in the 
Marger matters and, by illustration, all 
ithe American colony at the confer- 
ence was taken aback first when a 
hree-power guarantee treaty was an- 
punced, and second, when the Shan- 
A ung surrender was made a matter of 
; #7 yommon knowledge. 
wa, Yet the entire circumstances which 
: surround the publication of the fact 
as to the four-power treaty in Wash- 
ington béar close resemblances to 
either of the foregoing incidents at 
Paris. Why was the three-power 
treaty signed in Paris, why did Mr. 
Wilson agree to guarantee France 
against German aggression? For the 
very simple reason that only by this 
concession, by this payment, could he 
persuade the Frencl to accept certain. 
conditions which were essential to the 
realization of his plan for a league 
of nations. : 
Why did Mr. Hughes negotiate 
with Mr. Balfour and Baron Kato 
a-treaty which extended to the main 
land of Japan certain benefits which 
did not apply to the homeland of the 
United States or of Great Britain? 
For a very simple reason, because un- 
less Japan and the British Empire 
were prepared to scrap the Anglo- 
Japanese alliance, there could be -no 
naval agreement, no naval holiday, for 
th United States could not agree 
to eliminate many units of defense 
and abandon any progran of fortifi- 
~ ation in the Pacific while the two 
great naval powers of the Far East 
were united in an all‘ince. 
Mr. Hughes dealt with the same 
problen which faced Mr. Wilson. He 


| had to get rid of something which 
was in the way of success for his 
negotiations. But unhappily he chose 
to deal with it exactly the same 
way. From the moment the confer- 
ence met and the representatives of 
tl} three great Pacific powers estab- 
lished contact, the Pacific agreement 
was the main business in hand. Mr. 
Ba:four even spent time on his voy- 
age out sketching a proposal for such 
an agreement. 

TREATY FRAMED 

IN SECRET. 

A week ago in writing here I said 
that Mr. Balfour's draft called for 
something much more like an alliance 
than was actually: adopted. I find 
that I was misinformed on this point 
and that what Mr.‘ Balfour actually 

ought ashore was no more than the 
collection of a few ideas looking to 
an arrangement for insuring contact 
between the Pacific powers and the 
number was not stated. It was a 
looser arrangement not a* closer ar- 
rangement than was finally adopted. 

During all the time when the press 


was filled with the “battle of the 
ratios” the discussion of the naval 
questions in public was little more 
than a red herring drawn across the 
trail of the debate over the Pacific 
question. Everyone recognized that 
nothing could be done until the An- 
glo-Japanese alliance was eliminated, 
but everyone equally clearly recog- 
nized that’ the Anglo-Japanese alli- 
ance would only go when certain con- 
cessions were made by the United 
States. 


ae

‘“ 
c 


ance, the success of our whole con- 
ference depended upon getting rid of 
it just as the success of Mr. Wil- 
son's league turned upon preventing 
the French from annexing German 
territory on the lert bank of the 
Rhine. The question was how much 
we would pay and how much we 
could pay, for the experience in the 
league of nations fight had shown 
that there was the senate to be reck- 
oned with and that certain checks 
drawn by American representatives 
in a world conference would not be 
honored at the bank. 


But in all this time when these 
discussions were going on not a sin- 


out as to the real as contrasted with 
the assumed business of the confer- 
ence. The conference knew every- 
thing waited upom the Pacific treaty, 
the world believed that everything 
was held up pending agreement upon 
such details as the Mutsu and the 
contending ratios. If anyone cares 
to look back over the newspaper re- 
ports of the first weeks of the confer- 
ence he will find little or nothing to 
suggest that the conference was ac- 
tually absorbed in the preparation of 
a three or four-power treaty. 

But, as time passed, agreement 
upon the form of the treaty began to 
seem assured. Then, quictly at first, 

ut daily-with more definiteness, the 
ritish correspondents began to 
speak of a new treaty which was

We wanted to get rid of the alli- 


gle whisper was permitted to leak: 


about to emerge. Lord Riddell, 
his daily talks with the British cor- 
respondents, which were largely at- 
tended by American’ correspondents, 
gave more and more precise indica- 
tions of this treaty. The American 
newspapers began to hint at it Noth- 
ing was precise, nothing clear, but 
no one could misunderstand that 
something was coming. 

Now in all this time what was the 


attitude of the American delegation? 
Mr. Hughes had assumed the duty of 
acting as sole expusitor of: the Amer- 
ican “side of the conference to the 
press. Daily he was asked about 
this alliance, daily he replied that 
he could say nothing and left it to 
be inferred that, as a delegate to the 
conference, he could not discuss 
secret matters. You had. then, for 
a whole week an atmosphere of se- 
crecy, of mystery and of confusion, 
‘completely recalling the days—and 
nights—at Paris. when Mr. Wilson 
was conferring with Clemenceau and 
Lloyd-George. Mr. Hughes was do- 
ing exactly the same. thing with Mr. 
Balfour and Baron Kato. 


CRITICISM PROVOKED 
BY SECRECY. 

As this thing continued criticism 
began to be heard for the first time 
and this criticism provoked, first re- 
sentment and then apprehension, but 
it did not lead to explanation. Then, 
suddenly, at night, without any warn- 
a decision was made to hold a 
‘plenary session the next day. Agree- 


‘Ment had at last been had upon the 


terms of this mysterious document, 
consent had come from Tokio, Paris 
and London and state department of- 
ficials. worked all night distributing 
tickets of admission to this new ses- 
sion. 

At this new session Senator Lodge 
read the four-power treaty. He could 
not explain that this represented the 
attainment of the first objective, to 
set rid of the Anglo-Japanese alliance; 
he could not say anything about the 
realities because he was a member of 
the conference. And the American 
delegation had neglected to provide 
any such machinery as the British 
had in Lord Riddell, no means of ex- 
plaining unofficially but yet exactly 
what-and why in the matter of Ameri- 
can policy and action. 

So Senator Lodge talked of “lily 
islands” and of peace andthe country, 
a little puzzled, after the league of 
nations experience, accepted the four- 
poWer treaty as a decorative contri- 
bvtion to the cause of Pacific peace, 
and settled back '« wait for the naval 
ratio discussion to end, still believ- 
ing th.t the naval matter was of first 
importance. But unfortunately Sena- 
tor’ Lodge omitted to mention the ex- 
not explain that it applied to the 
No such omis- 
sion marked the accounts of the 
British journalists. For example, J. 
©. Hamilton, of The London Chron- 
icle, walked from the conference hall 
to the telegraph office and cabled his 
newspaper that the treaty applied to 
the mainland of Japan. 

In the next few days this explana- 
tion was made to all the British cor- 
respondents through their own repre- 
sentatives, but it was mid-week be- 
fore these explanations began to find 
credence among the American corre- 
spondents, who had exactly nothing 
on the subject from their 6wn source 
of. information. At a mid-week ses- 
sion in response to an obscure ques- 
tion, Mr. Hughes casuaHy admitted 
that the islands of Japan were in- 
cluded. Only ene journalist of the 
seventy-odd present caucht the drift. 


in 


r 


tent of the four-power treaty; he did. 


te published it with the jociitaios 
that this step resembled the step 
taken by Mr. Wilson in giving # guar- 
antee to France. 


The next day Mr. Hughes made a 
brief reference to the published paral. 
lel between the three-power treaty of 
guarantee and the four-power treaty. 
He repulsed the idea that there was 
any parallel, but again conceded that 
the mainiand of Japan was included 
because the treaty said island domin- 
ions, and Japan Was an island, inany 
islands, in fact. So the matter rested 
for another day. and then at last Mr. 
Hughes permitted himself to be cross- 
examined and made answers so clear 
and specific as to set at rest all doubt. 
and for the first -time the mass - of 
the American correspondents . were 
able to give authoritative information 
to their readers of a fact which had 
been published in London nearly a 
week before and had been a matter of 
common knowledge in British journai- 
istic quarters for many days. 
SITUATION 
IS COMPLICATED. 

Meantime the situation was be- 
coming complieated. Many newspa- 
pers, with an obvious desire to defe 
the treaty and clear recollection of 
the senate fight over the league of 
nations, announced quite boldly that 
the treaty did not«apply to the main- 
land of Japan. Several senators de- 
fending the treaty against incipient at- 
tacks from the irreeoncilables did the 
same. All this antedated the admis- 
sion at the state department, and al!! 
hese volunteer champions found 
themselves in an embarrassing posi- 
tion when Mr. Hughes’ explanation a 
week after the event proved them 
mistaken. 


The* next step was sensational. In 
response to a question asked at the 
regular session with correspondents, | 
which is a part of the w®ekly calen- 
dar of the president, Mr. Harding as- 
serted that as he read the four-power 
treaty it did not apply to the main- 
land of Jgpan. After that the fat was 
in the fire, the first real sensation of 
the conference bad come, All over 
Washington the news spread that the 
president had interpreted the treaty 
in just the opposite fashion from that 
employed by the secretary of state, 
who had negotiated it. 

A few hours late?, of course, the 
president issue@i@his statement. He 
did not withdraw his own interpreta- 
tion; he merely announced that his 
secretary of state had given the treaty 
language a different interpretation; 
that he, the president, did not oppose 
that imterpretation and knew that the 
treaty had been negotiated and signed 
in this sense. But after the president 
spoke, then the demonstration on capi- 
tol hill, which had been totally un- 
impressive, took on an entirely differ- 
ent character and in all quarters there 
was heard talk about the need of 
amending the treaty. 


Now, I have dwelt upon al) ofethese 
circumstances for a very simple rea- 
son. Before the conference there was 
very widespread talk about open ses- 
sions. 
there could not be open sessions, 
in public, as in private business, that 
is, in dealings between nations, as in 
transactions between. individuals, 4 
certain measure of secrecy is: not only 
advisable, but positively necessary.

the four-power treaty applies to the 
mainjand of Japan, the point seems to 
me trivial because there is nothing in 
the four-power treaty which invoives 
force, guarantee or commitment be- 
yond the promise to respect the rights 
of others and talk over any threat to 
these rights, whether coming from 
within the four-power group or from 
without. After all, the four-power 
treaty is only a kind of cloud dropped 
conveniently, as the ancient goddesses 
used to drop clouds over their heroes 
in trouble, to permit the removal of 
the Anglo-Japanese treaty. 


What has produced all the so, 


just’as at Paris, is the fact that for 
many long weeks the Ameriean people 
were left totally in the dark as to 
what was going on between their rep- 
resentatives and those of other na- 
tions, No one expected a front seat 
at the sessions or a stenographic rec- 
ord of the conversations between Bar- 
on Kato, Mr. Balfour and Mr. Hughes, 
when they were drafting the four-pow- 
er treaty. But what the American 
people did desire, it would seem, was 
to know from their owh, not the 
British or Japaness, press agents, that 
a treaty was being negotiated. why 
there was a need of such treaty and, 
when the text of the treaty was pub- 
lished, what was,included and what 
was excluded from its purview. 

Mr. Wilson went to Europe talking 


nbout “open covenants openly arrived 
at,” and after Paris the phrase be- 
came a bitter term of reproach. The 
secreey of Paris defeated the results 
of Paris in the United, States quite 
as much as the facts which were in- 
cluded in the league of nations and 
in the treaty of Versailles generally. 
And the evil of the thing lived after 
the fight was over and the league 
buried by the senate. ‘There was cre- 
ated in the United States an infinite 
amount of suspicion about all inter- 
national conferences and sessions. 


Therefore it was a matter of life 
and death for those who were charged 


with carrying the Washington confer- 
ence through to success to avoid pro- 
‘iding for this potential suspicion any 
5asis for real action nstead, in the 
matter of the four-power treaty there 
has been more secrecy than there wars 
at Paris—and I was at Paris and 
say this thing deliberately and. with- 
out qualification. And this secrecy, 
utterly unnecessary secrecy, has led 
to a crisis which at least. momentarily 
travely injured the standing of the 
conference in the eyes of the American 
neople. 


And after the mistake was made. 


although the incident was closed and 
the treaty actually signed. 
PREDICTS FIGHT 
IN SENATE. 

Now 1 dwell upon these various 
circumstances for a single reason. We 


are obviously going to have a long | 
fight in the United States senate over | 


the four-power treaty, a fight which ' 


ems to me futile, and even wicked; 
futile, for it is inconceivable that any 
one could believe that the languag 
of the treaty itself binds ue to any- 
thing which amounts to more than 
good oebavior on our part and ua 
w'llingfess to talk matter#over with 
our Pacifie neighbors. Wicked, be- 
cause ,if. the present agreements are 
defeat@ in the United States senate; 
it wil a fairly long time before 
Europe or Aaa cares to negotiate new 
treaties with the United States. 


Yet the fight is made inevitable not 
by reason of what was done, but 
wholly as . result of the way it was 
done. The real weapons which Sena- 
tor Borah and his associates will have 
for use have been forced into their 
hands by the friends, the makers of 
the treaty, not its critics. 


The supreme advantage of perfect 
frankness all along the road is that 
it heaves those who are at work upon 
an international agreement relatively 
immune from the consequences of ac- 
cidents. If American diplomacy, like 
the much-divided European, “kept its 
people informed, that fatal element 
of surprise, so disastrous to Mr. Wil- 
‘son, sO embarrassing recently to Mr. 
Hughes, would not play -a part. There 
is only one safe diplomacy and that 
is open diplomacy, the Europeans 
know it and employ it habitually. 
The governments use their press to 
prepare their public just as Colonel 
Roosevelt, in his days of greatness 
and power, used thé Washington cor- 
respondents to educate the country to 
his*views and purposes. In point of 
fact, in the case of Europes the more 
dangerous and unpopular the ends 
sought, the more extensive the cam- 
paign of education in the press in 
advance, 


Another victory by the United 
States senate, another episode like 
the rejection of the treaty of disaster, 
whatever its. effect upon world condi- 
tions economic, even more than polit. 
Seal, would be a national disaster for 
us. It would mean an isolation com: 
plete and costly beyond description. 
The pity is that the obstructionists 
in the senate have been provided with 
weapons all of which were once in 
the hands of the American delecates 
to the Washington conference... Once 


after the consent of the American} more the difference between American 
delegates to the interpretation of the | 474 ~uropesn diplomacy, between the 


treaty which included the Japanese 
mainland was finally dragged out, the. 
same policy of silence and secrecy 
was maintained. “One could _ learn 
from British sources that Mr. Bal- 
four had proposed this fhing, from 
Japanese sources that Baron Kato had 
opposed it. From both sources one 
could learn that the American repre- 
sentatives had accepted it. But from 
first to last Mr. Hughes flatly re- 
fused to tell his fellow countrymen 
‘hat had heen the action of the 
American deleration. why they had 
aecepted, what they had said or done, 


so-cal Ned “new” and the “old-fash- 
ioned,” would appear to be that the 
‘former seeks open ends bv 


secret | 


methods, while the latter sometimes ; 


used open. methods to attain secret 
ends.

Watson Condemns 
Federal Reserve 


‘Deflation Policy 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Constitution Burean, 

Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, December 31.—(By 
Constitution Leased Wire.)—Sehator 
Thomas FB. Watson, of Georgia, on the 
eve of New Year, issued a dictated 


}statement tonight, in which. he criti- 


cised the federal reserve board, and 
declared no permanent prosperity 
could ensue as long as the board “con- 
tracts currency.” ‘The statement fol- 
lows : 

“There can be no genéral improve- 
ment in the business conditions of the 
country so long us the federal reserve 
board continues its destructive policy 
of contracting the currency. 

: Wants More Money. 

“What is needed is an increase in 
the amount of money in actual cireu- 
lation; bank reserves are just so much 
dead capital. The billions of gold which 
have been withdrawn from use are as 
dangerus as they are inactive, 

“Kwerywhere we see increasing tax- 


|; ation, waste of public money, concen- 


tration of power and decrease of op- 
portunities for eaployment and pro- 
duction. The prosperity of a nation 
does not depend upon the amount of its 
wealth, but upon its equitable distri- 
bution, 

Wealth Congestion. 

“At present, the wealth is congest- 
ed; and the tederal reserve system has 
adopted as its permanent policy, more 
congestion, instead of more distribu- 
tion. Prohibitive import duties have 
swept our merchant marine off the 
seas; whereas, under the Walker tar- 
if of 1848, three-iourths of our im- 
ports and exports were carried op 
Ameriean bottoms. 

‘The national banks and the federal 
reserve bans have usurped the govern- 
inental function of creating and con- 
trolling mondy. 

“Thus, the money monopoly and the 
manufacturers’ monopoly—aided by 
the transportation monopolies—are 
waging war upon the general welfare 
of the people.’

‘ . 


That the system of tenant farming, | 


largely conducted by ignorant people, 
is shot full of “rottenness” and must 
go into the discard with full infesta- 
tion of the state by bol! weevil, and 
that new blood from other seé¢tions is 
necessary to save the agricultural! fab- 
ric of Georgia from ruin, are feature 
statements in a statement just issued 
by H. G. Hastings, president of ‘the 
Georgia association. * 

_In addition ‘to scoring the tenant 
system, which he declares “is mining 
the land and exhausting its fertility 
instea. of preserving it,” 
Hastings declares that. young people 
with .nodern ideas, who are ver in 
raising other commodities than «ad 
alone, are willing to come to this 
state provided the message of its un- 


to them. 

He declares that the Georgia asso- 
ciation is the willing carrier 6f such. 
a message to the whole nation, and 


for full support of the organization. 
The communication in full fallows: 
Hastings’ Statement. 
“When will the people of Georgia 


rin 


quit doing the ostrich act of hiding 
their heads in the sand, thus fai)l- 
ing to see the real down-at-the- 
bottom fundamental trouble that 
afflicts Georgia at the present 
time? 

“On every hand we hear talk of 
the damage the bol] weevil has 
done, now that we have experi- 
enced the first full flood of weevil 
infestation. Apparently nobody 
really expected the weevil to do 
serious damage despite the fact 
that for ten years or more warn- 
ings have been sounded regularly 
in Georgia and our people told that 


they must change our agricultura 
system, 

“The boll weevil is really inci- 
dental. The real trouble is the 
tenant farming system that has 
done more to ruin our lands and 
& large part: of our people than 
did the civil war: We Know that 
this is strong language but it is 
justified by the facts and the con- 
dition that our people find them- 
selves in now. 

Interest in Situation. 

“We have watched the situation 
with intense interest hoping that 
50Me. one else, far better fitted, 
would telt our people the bald 
truth. Our papers are full of talk 
about marketing schemes for this, 


that and the other thing and 
Switching from cotton growing to 
other forms of diversified produc- 
tion. We have no criticism to make 
of these worthy ambitions but the 
generality of our farm people have 
no surplus of these diversified items 
to sell ab@ve their nome needs. 
“Speaking in round numbers the 
United States census (1920) shows 
Georgia as having about 330,000 
farms. Of these, 110,000 are oper- 
ated by their owners either with 
their own Jabor or their own labor 
in combination with hired lapbor. 
The other 220,000, two-thirds of the 
total, is tenant farming of the low- 
est type, largely 
tenants going on either without any 
or at best nominal supervision. . 
“Who are the owners of these 
tenant infested acres? Largely 
eminent, perfectly respectable and 
otherwise sensible white 
living either in Atlanta, Augusta, 
Macon, Savannah or any of the 150 
odd courthouse cities and towns 
scattered around the state. These 
folks have been getting ‘cotton’ 
rent for their acres thinking; fool- 
ishly, that they were getting a 
profit when they were actually de- 
pleting their capital which is the 
natural fertility of the farm soil. 


Tenant System Scored. 


“The tenant with his ‘land skin- 
ning’ style of operations was and 
is far wiser than the land owner 
who rents to, him on any of the 
various renting plans prevalent in 
Georgia. It was to the tenant's 
interest to take al] that he could 
from the land and put little or 


nothing back in and that is exactly ; 


what has been gving on here in 
Georgia for fifty years or more on 
two-thirds of our farms. Is it any 
wonder that so much of our once 
fertile farm acreage has had to be 
abandoned so far as cultivation is 
concerned? 

“This rotten system meant all 
cotton on this tenant acreage up 
to the limit of the tenant's ability 
to tend even without boll weevil 
as a factor. The landlord demand- 
ed cotton rent, fertilizer. men, sup- 
ply merchant, country banker, e«cce., 
all demanded a)] cotton acreage 
as the price for staking tenant dl- 
rectly or indirectly for food, cloth- 
ing fertilizer, etc., furnished dur- 
ing the season while the crop was 
in process of making. 


| “All through this system ran the) 
intent, 


conscious or otherwise, to 
keep the tenant In a condition of 
economic slavery to the factors 


'cupplying him land, food and eloth- 


| question.

Only once did the tenant ever really - 
~et out of control and that was 
during 1919. This led to the large 
oxnansion of credits to tenants in 
1920 in an effort to cet them un- | 
der control again with its conse- 
nuent disaster to supply merchants 
and others in 1920. The game was 
to keep the tenant in debt and con- 
eequently under control, not 
throveh wise personal supervision 
on the part of the land owner but

Farming Fabric of Georgia

price, .to pay for tne subsistence of 
himself, his famfly and his work- 
ing live stock on a top retail price 
baets usually plus a fairly stiff 
credit or interest enarge. 


Owned by Whites. 


“These 220,000 tenant farms in 
Georgia are largely owned by white 
men who for ene reason or another 
navé moved eith to the towns or 
cities and are, or, rather, have been 
up to now, living largely off of 
cotton rent. ° 
supervision of their tenants is of 
the most nominal character. 
long as the tenant works his cot- 
ton and brings tn his rent bale or 
bales he is largely left alone. Here- 
tofore his tenant-worked acres 
have been sort of a cotton mine 
from which he drew dividends with 
greater or less regularity. The 
dividend paying part of the cotton 
mine is now playing out due to the 
boll weevil 4 

“A critical situation, confronts 
not only the lana owners but the 
business interests of our towns and 
cities :whose business prosperity is 
dependent on productive acres. Di- 


President l@ectly or indirectly most of us 


have *been pombe a spade this seil 
destroying and man dextroying 
tenant system that has held back 
Georgia at least twenty-five years 
its otherwise natural develop- 
ment. 

“The continuance of the tenant 
system has been dependent on cot- 
ton production largely unhindered 
by insect enemies and plant dis- 
eases The day of freedom from 
insect attacks is over. The weevil 
is not only a dangerous factor but 
a constant one. The day of the old 
style tenant system based on ex- 
clusive cotton production, practi- 
cally without competent white or 
land owner supervision is* fone. 
The day of planting cotton to the 
limit of he tenant’s ability to tend 
in the old#slip shod way is done. 


, Three Alternatives. 


“Three clear and distinct alterna- 
tives face our farm land owning 
folks who have been living in town 
on cotton rent. They must accept 
one of the three. Under weevil 
eonditions there is no other way 
out. Cotton cannot be profitably 
produced under boll weevil condi- 
tions by ignorant tenants without 
competent supervision, 

“The first alternative is for the 
white landowner now living in 
town to go back son his land and 
stay there, intelligently and con- 
stantly giving personal supervision 
to the labor engaged in crop mak- 
ing. Under such supervision, limit- 
iting cotton acreage to not exceed- 
ing five acres to the plow, putting 
the other acreage in food and grain 
crops, cotton growing can be made 
profitable and if combined with live 
stock production, the depleted soil 
fertility restored 

“How many of these town living, 
farm land owning folks, softened 
by years of town living and rela- 
tive ease will have the backbone 
and courage to go back to the land 
and do the perfectly obvious and 
nec@ssary thing remains to be seen. 
I hazard the opinion that the num- 
ber will be relatively small. 

“The second alternative is for 
them to stay in town with no in- 
come from the farm land and eke 


, while the once fertile 
and ape revert to the old field 
nines and broom sedge. tndoubt- 
edly mil'ions of perfectly good 
acres will thus be let go back to 
nature. 

Bring in Settlers. 


‘The third alternative is to bring 
in. through perfectly legitimate and 
truthfu] advertising and promotion, 
several hundred thousand energetic 
young farm-raisee folks from the 
states to the north of us end settle 
them on our unused lands, same 
heing sold to them on the most 
favorable terms. 

“There are in all probability a 
million or more of these farm- 
raised young men and women who 
cannot get a land owning foothold 
where.thev are, due to hith cost of 
land and the large amount of cap- 
ital necessary to make a start. 
These folks are real farmers, not

Gives Example. 


“Tl was intensely interested a 
month ago in talking with a dairy- 
man from New York state who was 
here during the farm bureau con- 
vention. This man was one of the 
farm bureat party that the Georgia 
association took on a two-days’ 
trip. He is coming back here to 
get a location for his son who 
wants to start in the dairy business 
under more favorable conditions 


“This dairyman lives in a small 
than are present in New York state. 
farming community near AlJjbany, 
N. Y He stated that, in addition 
to his own son, he knew of at 
least fifteen young farm-raised 
men who were looking for — such 
opportunities as he saw on his two- 
days’ trip and that they could be 
brought to Georgia easily if our 
resources and opportunities were 
properly presented to them. I 

‘The important thing for us to 
realize is that there are thousands 


of just such farm cvummunities each } 


with their ten, fifteen or more am- 
bitioys farm-raised young men who 
cannot get a foothold with $200 to 
$400 per-acre lend and who would 
welcome a chance to start indepen- 
dent farm life under favorable con- 
ditions and opportunities such as 
Georgia abounds itn. They know 
little or nothing’ about Georgia 
now. It is onlv a vague geographi- 
eal unit of whieh their notions are 
hazy and _ incorrect. They will 
never know about Georgia unless 
they are told bv us. Thev will 
never come to Georgia unless we 
invite them whole-nfneartedly. 


MGeorgia. even without the wee- 
vil, had only one-third of ite till- 
able area under eultivation. Our 
present weevil infestation means 
beyond any question the abandon- 
ment of two or three million acres 
now under tenant cultivation unless 
the tenants are replaced by actual 
farmers from other states. Under 
such. circumstances can Georgians. 
either from city or countrv, afford 
to etand aloof and indifferent to 
every legitimate effort possible to 
bring new and desirable farm peo- 
ple into Georgia? 


Georgia Association. 


“The Georgia association has 
been -doing its best, with a mini- 
mum of both moral and financial 
support from those in Georgia most 
vitelly interested, to get attention 
turned this wav. In accord with 
the emal!l amount available the re- 
sults have been surprisinely good. 
Our experience shows that, the 
Jeorgia associatiwon, properlv sup- 
ported. can easilv turn a tide of 
young farm-raised men to Georgia 
acres, men trained to dairying, live 
stock and diversified crovs and who 
wil) be independent of eotton. 

“We have simplv got to fill up 
these otherwise idle acres or else 
Georgia will slip and slip fast and 
permanent disaster come to. city, 
town and country alike. The quick- 
ness with which the tide can be 
turned our way ta absolutely de- 
nendent on the supnort given the 
only eagercy that sis usine everv 
nossible effort to turn the tide this 
way. Our present situation shonld 
not be looked on as a disaster but 
rather a summons for every mn. 
and woman in Georeta, to face per- 
fectly obvious facts and more 
npromptiv turn the present discour- 
agine situ*tion into a real soennd 
aer'cultura] erd hrsinese develon- 
ment that will make Georcia in 
reality the ‘Empire Stcte.’ not onl¥

Congressman William D. Upshaw 
will be the principal speaker at the 
celebration Sunday night of the fourth 
anniversary of the pastorate of Rev. 
John W. Ham at the-Baprist -Taber- 
nacle, and will take a prominent part 
in the inaugural program surrounding 
the beginning of the fifth year’s work 


at this church under the supervision 
of Mr. Ham. 

Congressman Upshaw will speak on 
the subject “The Crown of the Ui- 
known Worker.” In announcing his 
subject, it is declared that he will 
show the value and character of the 
unknown worker; will define the peo- 
ple who make up the great mass of 
democracy, and will dea! primarily 
with the moral, spiritual and indus- 
trial phases of the subject. 

Plea for Justice. 

“His address will be neither social- 
istie nor capitalistic, but will be a 
plea for the humanitarian teuch on 
one hand and justiee on the other,” 
the announcement reads. “The clos- 
ing part of his address will deal with 
the spiritual aspect of the subject. He 
will glorify the worker and in passing 
will urge immed.ate action of the mu- 
nicipal.ty in setting) in motion the ex- 
penditure of the bond issue ia order 
to meet the growing situation of idle- 
ness. . 

Congressman Upshaw will speak on 
many other interesting phases of his 
subject. Arrangements have been 
completed for handling an enormous 
erowd, which is expected to take part 
in’ the ceremonies and to hear. the 
speech of the Atlanta congressman 


and orator. 


The Baptist Tabernacle was estab- 
lished about 20 years ago, with Dr. 
Len G. “roughton, noted minister, as 
pastor. After serving for many years 
as pastor, Dr. Broughton accepted a 
eall to a church in London, England. 
Mr. Ham took charge as pastor of the 
Tab_rnacle in 1917. 

Membership Doubled. 

In four yeurs the membership of 
the church has more than doubled. 
The membership of the church in 1917 
was 952, and the Sunday school that 
year had an average attendance of 
ool. In four years the church has 
added 1,394, making a total present 
membership of 2,346. 

Sunday school attendance during 
these years has increased as follows: 
1917, 531; 1918, G14; 1919, 832; 
1920, 1,336, and up to November re- 
port, 1921, average per Sunday, 1,541. 

Four years ago the church had a 
debt of $111,000 and during this four 
years the money to puy this sum was 
raised’ and the mortgage paid off and 
burned. A total of $240,000 for all 
purposes has been raised and expended. 

Two revivals and one Bible confer- 
ence are conducted’ at the church 
every year. The chureh does not de- 
pend on these agencies for additions, 
however, but makes them supplemental 
to the recular program of work. The 
larges’ number of additions to the 
church has been made through regu- 
lar preaching and not through re- 
vivals.

Sheriff Middlebrooks, it is said, 


etwold that he and a man named Tucker 


‘pprehended Bonner and _ promised 
lim immunity if he would tell all he 
knew of the killing. Bonner is’ said 
to have told the officers that he ac-

Sims was arrested but freed after

trial for the murder. ‘Sims was not 
indicted in connection with this case. 
Jones’ wife was a sister to Sheriff 
Middlebrooks, it is understood. 


GOVERNOR HARDWICK 
DISCUSSES ACTION. 

Governor Thomas W. Hardwick. 
when informed of developments last 
night said he was surprised; as no 
report had been made to him. 

“While I am not at-all in sympathy 
with the appeal made to the federal 
court in this case,’ said the governor. 
“Il am going to do anything I can 
to see that the spirit of the law as 
well_as the letter of the law is car 
ried out, and, if there is any danger 
of trouble I will, immediately that the 
Bibb county authorities indicate it to 
me, support those authorities in pre- 
serving respect for the law it it takes 
every unit of militia in the state. 

“Ll wired the sheriff of Jones coun- 
ty yesterday that I had declined to in- 
terfere in any way with the sentence 
of the court in the Bonner case, and 
had also declined to. reprieve the man. 
I toldhim, though, 1 was: informed 
that a supercedeas order had been 
or would be issued by the federal 
effect of 
staying the execution and, if that or- 
der was properly served upon him he 


' should respect it. 


- 


’ “T told the sheriff of Jones county, 
niso, if in his judgment the delay of 
the execution ,of the court’s sentence 
would endanger the life of the negro. 
and cause trouble that would reflect 
upon the state he should remove him 
to some other county to a place of 
safety. I assume hs acted upon that 
suggestion and transferred the negro 
to Bibb county. That information 
sent from my office to the sheriff was 
the last I have heard of the case, ex- 
cept that I was informed the super- 
cedeas order of the federal court was 
served upon Sheriff Middlebrooks. 

“This Vater information is entirely 
new to me. Under the circumstances 
it would appear that the negro should 
be held by the Bibb county authorities, 
‘and possibly he should be removed to 
some even safer place, more distant 
from Jones county, to be held ugftil | 
the federal court has disposed of Me 
appeal taken there,” he said.

After months of intensive investi- 
gation and.study, Rebert H.. Whitten, 
zoning expert and consultant to the 
city planning commission, has prepar- 
ed in conjunction with H. D. Cutter, 
Jr., engineer of the body, a tentative 
zone plan for Atlanta, which will be 
submitted at a meeting of the commis- 
sion Monday morning at 10 o'clock, 


and if approved will be passed on to 


city council for adoption. 

If it becomes a law, every propérty 
owner in the city of Atlanta will ‘be 
affected by its provisions, which are 
sweeping in. character. Members 
council and of the planning comm 
sion have been called into frequent 
consultation by Mr. Whitten and kept 
well informed on the progress and in- 
tention of the plan. 

As’ shown in ‘detail on the acctom- 
panying map. the city is divided into 
six classes of use districts. Two of 
these are residence districts and four 
are business and industrial districts. 

Classes of Districts. 


In addition to the use. districts, 
th..e are four classes of height. dis- 
tricts and five classes of area dis- 
tricts. f 

The height and area ‘districts are 
superimposed over’ the use districts, 
consequently each portion of the city 
is in some one of the six classes of 
usé districts and also in some one of 
the five classes of area districts. 

The two classes of residence dis- 
‘ ici are; as reference to the map will 
show, class U-1, of dewlling house 
district, and class U-2, or apartment 
house district. 

A building arranged for more than 
two families may not be constructed 
in a ling house district. One of 
the chief purposes of the zoning pian 
is to presery Atlanta as a city | of 
homes, it is said. While a certain 
; mber of apartment houses are bene- 
ficial. it is stated, they shonld not be 
allow7d ‘» drive out the private homes 
in any section of the city. es 
limited, but adequate areas are al- 
lowed for apartment house dev@op- 
me*t. The residence districts, from, 
rtment houses are excluded.

locations, with the approval of the 
‘board of zoning appeals. 

Race Districts. 

The residence districts are further 
subdivided into race districts. In the 
white residence districts no house not 
occupied Ly a negro family at the 
time of the passage of the zoning ordi- 
nance can be thereafter occupied by 
a col..ed family. In tue colored resi- 
dence districts no house not occupied 
by a white family at the time of the 
passage of the zoning ofdinance can 
be thereafter occupied by a white 
famliy. Servants’ quarters located 
on the same lo* as the residence they 
serve will be allowed in either dis- 
trict, without .distinction as to race, 
Certain limited residence areas are 
placed in neither the white nor the 
colored district, but ate left undeter- 
mined as to the race zoning. 

There are four classes of business 
and industrial districts, inclading a lo- 
éal retail store district, commercial 
district, industrial districts, and in- 
d ‘jal “semi-nuisance”’ district. 
In the local retail store district 
retail stores, offices and smal] shops 
for custom work or for the ‘making 


premises.are permitted. The uses per- 
mitted in the residence districts are 
aleo permitted in the local retail busi- 
ness district. Public garages, light 
manufacturing and bulk storage are 
excluded from the local rétail Business 
district. This district is suitable 
chiefly for the smaller retail centers 
adjacent to the residential sections. 
The attempt has been in‘ the plan to 
nrovide small areas for neighborhood 
stores at half-mile intervals through- 
out the residence sections. 
Commercial ‘District. 

The commercial district regulations 
ermit, in additions to ‘all uses al- 
lowed in the local retail business dis- 
trict, light manufacturing of a non- 
nuisance character, ‘and also public 
warages, bnik storage and wholesale 
: bari The commercial districts 
will iaclele most of the central busi- 
ness sections along the main traffic

“Class A-5, with no required lot

mercial districts. 

“The area districts are superim- 
posed over the height and use dis- 
tricts. The area district regulations 
are intended to promote an appro- 
priate distribution of population and 
to resist the tendency toward the 
congestion of population. The require-

crematory, aviation field, sewage dis-; 


ater plant or refuse dump may be, 
ocated } 


enivy on application to and 
with the approval of the board of zon- 
int appeals. 

Height of Buildings. 


Maximum height of buildings will 
be limited to 150 feet in the future; 
—if the plan is adopted. There are 
four height districts, the residence 
sections, where maximum height of 
dwellings will be fixed at 35 feet: 
the apartment house area, where the 
limit will be 50 feet, permitting the 
erection of the ordinary four-story 
apartment or four-story commercial 
building: most of the industrial areas, 
where office structures and factories 
will be limited to 100 feet, and in the 
central business area, where the most 
‘ntensive office and hotel development 
is. anticipated, buildings may go up 
150 feet. 

Already there are in the city seven 
office and hotel structures more than 
150 feet tall. The object of limiting 
building heights is to spread out the 
areas of intensive use in order to les- 
sen the burden of eraffic congestion 
on the streets. “The widths of the 
streets will not take care of the traf- 
fic of a three-story city.” states Mr. 
Whitten, “and it will be absolutely 
tlisaktrous to butden them with the 


city.”

=y reference to the key letters and figures on the map a clear idea of Atlanta’s future development under the zoning plan may be obtained. The proposed zones are distinctly defined by means of shading, and 
the sedulations governing the class of buildings allowed, areas in which the different classes of buildings, business and industries will be allowed, and the heighth of buildings, are explained by the key letters and figures. 


cause of the nuisance features incident 
to the normal operations of the fac- 
tories. While ‘the zone plan does not 


frohibit the erection of residences 
even in the semi-nuisance izdustrial 
districts, it will tend to discourage the 
erection of dwellings therein for two 
reasons ; first, with definite areas set 
aside for residences and factories, the 
financial hazard incident 9 the plac- 
ing of residences in a factory zone will, 
in most cases, serve as a sufficient 
deterre_t; second, the semi-nuisance 
industrial districts will be placed in 
the A-1 area districts which will re- 
quire 5,000 square feet of lot area per 
family,’ This will further tend to 
make the erection of a residence in one 
of these districts uneconomic. 


Shrine Snow Dance

Vell, Atlanta has had one snow 
storm this winter, and the weather 


4inis 
man was all the time doing his best 
to prévent it by dispensing a brand’ 
of weather more im harmony with May 
blossoms. ‘Thé showstorm occurred 
at t'e Auditorium last night at Yaa- | 
rab Temple’s snow dance, and while 
it was not the real, genuine article, 
it looked like it as it .sifted down 
from the rafters through the shim- 
merin blue and amber lights, and 
sprinkled the snow. men, pine poughs 
and the huge crowd of dancers. 

A crowd estimated at 5,000 packed 
the Anditorium whan the curtain went 
up, disclosing Yaarah’s million-do!lar 
band seated on the stage in a grove 
of pine trees covered with “snow.”

-Both Are in Cannes, 
France, Awaiting Com- 
dng Meeting of Allied 
* ‘Supreme Council 


a ae ae

Sue Or es 


Cannes, France, December 31.— 
(By. the Associated Press.)—George 
Harvey, American ambassador to 
Great Britain, this afternoon had his 
first conversation with Premier 
Lioyd-George, since their arrival here 
for next week’s meeting of the. al- 
lied supreme council. The interview, 
which was informal, took place at the 
golf club. 

Ambassador Harvey told the corre- 
spondent that his talk with the Brit- 
ish prime minister was of a gen- 
eral nature, and did not include dis- 
cussion of the submarine, or any oth- 
er question in which the United 
States was vitally interested. 


Harvey Only Observer. 


Mr. Harvey let it be known that 
the/ United States would make no 
move for a more active part in the 
approaching council meeting, and said 
America’s position would be the same 
as at the council’s last meeting in 
Paris, despite British reports to the 
contrary. Should the allies desire 
that the United States participate 
fully im consideration of plans for an 
economic conference, or in discussions 
of the German reparations question, 
they must request it. Otherwise, the 
American representative would sit in 
next week's session only as an in- 
terested observer. 

It was said today, that Mr. Har- 
vey might take part in the prelimi- 
nary conversations between Mr. Lloyd- 
George and Premier Briand if the 
submarine question should come up. 

Those who are making arrange- 
ments for the council meeting, which 
is regarded as the most important de- 
liberation since the P@ris peace con- 
ference. have taken peace and tran- 
quality as their motive. The advance 
agents of the meeting are endeavor- 
ing to see that consideration of these 
vital problems shall be carried on 
in a quiet atmosphere. 

In Yachting Club. 

The Cannes Yacthing club, one of 
the most beautiful on the Riviera, 
has been given over entirely for use 
during the conference. It consists of 
a series of luxurious salons. The 
largest, in which the council’s ses- 
sions will be held, faces the Medi- 
terranean, which cith easily be seen 
by the delegates during their de- 
liberations. The walls of this room 
have been specially hung with cheer- 
ful pietures, war subjects being care- 
fully avoided. 

The experts, who are making ad- 
vance preparations, say they have 
adopted the idea of providing ideal 
spots for the holding of such de- 
liberations for the good of mankind 
and the peace of the world, They 
argue that, if environment counts for 
anything, the Cannes conference will 
start under more favorable conditions, 
than those surrounding any previous 
wneeting of the council. 


Kind Disposition 
To Jobless Boarders 
Causes Landlord’s Ruin 


_ The desire of H. 8. Badger, who 

formerly conducted several boarding 
. houses in the city, to be of aid to his 
' boarders in their time of need proved 
s+ his own undoing, according to his 
story. He is now out of employment, 
he says, and is gréatly in need of 
money for the support of his family. 

Mr. Badger’s benevolent spirit caus- 


iy } ed him the loss of about $10,000, 
» and forced him, with his wife and 


* three children, to live in a small room 
at 20 Gilmer street. He has been 
seeking employment for five months, 
hé said, subsequent to the closing of 
his boarding houses because he was 
unable to pay rent. 

He said that he formerly was in 
comfortable circumstancés through the 
revenue derived from his boarding 
houses. When the 
came, it is stated, he gave instructions 
that no boarders who had lost their 
jobs were to be. ejected because of 
their failure to pay their rent. 

The result of this, he states, was 
that he himself was unable to pay 
rental of the boarding houses, and 
was *forced to give up his business. 
He has since been unable to secure 
employment, and states that he wil 
be glad to get work of any kind. 


TO RESUME WORK 
ON TUGALOO DAM 


‘Continued from First Page. 


with additions and improvements nec- 
essary to supply the service the public 
demands. In the certainty that the 
evidence submitted at the hearing 
would convince the railroad commis- 
sion that the company is entitled to a 
valuation on the gas properties of at 
least $7,000,000 and a higher rate than 
*$1.65, I had authorized, before the de- 
cision was given out, the announce- 
ment that we would go ahead imme- 
diately with the construction of the 
Tugaloo dam and pewerhouse, 

“I want to assure tne public that, 
even in the face/of this decision, we 
are going ahead with the construction 
of this development. The employment 
of a large number of men; the stimu- 
lation of business that will result; the 
fact that the progress of Georgia de- 
pends on more hydro-electric energy, 
all make it our duty to live ap to our 
determination to make this develop- 
ment, if it is humanly possible to 
do 80. 

“But the public must sooner or later 
understand that when it fixes our rates 
through its _ representatives it fixes 
the standard of service that can be 


furnished.” | 


Work for 1,000 Men. 

The Tugaloo development, will pro- 
vide employment for upwards of 1,000 
men for a year and a half or longer. 
Already. about 200 men are on the 
scene of the development ready to be- 
gin work thie week. ‘This number will 
be augmented week after week, as the 
construction progresses and more men 
are needed, until, it is estimated by 
the latter part of June, more than 
1,000 men will be employed. 

It ig expected that the first unit 
of the Tugaloo development will be 
in service in the early fall of 1923, 
and that the entire capacity of the 
station will be available by January 
1, 1924. Pouring of concrete in the 
dam will begin in June, at which time 
it is expected that dedication cere- 
monies will take place. 

The Tugaloo development will in- 
crease the present water power ca- 
: of the Georgia Railway and 

company approximately 43 per 
cent, a long stride toward putting the

In the above map is shown the en- 
tire chain of monster water power 
developments planned by the Georgia 


Railway and Power companay for the 
Tallwlah and Tugaloo rivers. The 
~ pes sketch shows the water surface 
of the various developments, while 
the lower diagram shows the location 
and elevation of the units of the 
chain, being so drawn as to fit into 
The first 
dam to the left is the Burton -devel- 
opment, which backs water over a 
vast area and which has been fullly 
completed. The second development 
is the seed development, which has not 
been begun as yet but which will be 
constructed as fast as the pla~s for 
the entire chain permit. ‘The third 
development is the Mathis-Tallulah 
dam, which also has a considerible 
back-water area end which has been 
completed. 
the Tallulah Falls dam, which has 
also been completed and which, due 
to the tremendous velocity of the wa- 
ter falling for 608 feet over the Tal- 
lulah Falls, is far the most powerful 
unit-in the entire chain. The fifth 
dam is the Tugaloo development, 
which will reservoir the water from 
Tallulah Falls. This development is 
now being constructed. The final de- 
velopment is’ the Ralston dam, the 
last unit of the big chain, which is 
the next to be constructed by the 
power company. 


From figures shown in the chart. 


The fourth development is\ 


F capacity, 


water which starts from the Burton 
dam and travels through the chain of 
reservoirs and dams will fall 1,220 
feet, being utilized six. times to gen- 
erate power before it is entirely free 
of its fetters. To accomplish this feat 
of engineering, the power company 
will construct modern power houses 
at the foot of each dam to take care 
of its own particular fall and to aid 
the big plant at Tallulah Falls. In tak- 
ing this remarkable drop, thé water 
will cover an air line distance of 24,51 
miles and an actual river distance of 
40.62 miles. |

stalled on the Burton dam. These 
flash boards will be operated by elec- 
tric motors under a single float switch 
and entirely automatic in their oper- 
ation. The boards will be designed 
{to hold the level of the pond seven 
|_}feet above the masonry crest of the 
spillway and the spillway will be de- 
signed for an overflow sufficient to 
discharge 50,000 cubic feet of water 
fper second. 
Big Drainage Area. 

The drainage area above the dam is 
approximately 481 square miles and 
the urea of the reservoir which will 
be formed by the Tugaloo dam will be 
approximately 557 acres, the available 
drawdown of pondage being 725,000,- 
000 cubic feet of water. : 

The average annual output of the 
Tugaloo plant will be approximately 
130,000,000 kilowatt hours. The 
present output of the Georgia Railway 
and Power company is 300,000,000 
kilowatt hours per annum, from 
which it can be noted that the Tugaloo 
development will increase the ‘otal 
output of the system about 43 per 
cent of the present capacity. 

The powerhouse will be located 
approximately 200 feet below the dam, 
and will be 65 feet wide and 200 feet 
long. -'The sub-structure and walls as 
high as the window ledges of the 
generator floor will be of solid con- 
crete with a super-structure of steel 
and red brick walls and a tiled roof 
over-head, 

A traveling crane of 100 tons ca- 
pacity will be installed for handling 
the héavy hydraulic and electrical ma- 
chinery. 

Hydraulic Equipment. 

The hydraulic equipment will con- 
sist of four 22,000 horse-power water 
wheels comprising the main units and 
an auxiliary wheel of 200 horse-power 
for station service requirements. ‘The 
generating equipment will consist of 
four 12,500, kilowatt, vertical type 
generators directly connected to the 
water wheels and a small exciter unit 
of 100 kilowatt capacity. 

The penstocks will be made of struc- 
tural steel plate, 13 feet in diameter 
and will extend from the intake struc- 
ture On the bulkhead section of the 
dam through the dam to the water 
fwheels in the station, there being a 
separate penstock for each unit. Each 
water wheel when operating under full 


giant blocks of approximately 10 tons 
each to form 33 1-3 per cent of th 
complete mass, the other two-thirds 
being made up of the mixed concrete. 

The quarry from which all rock 
will be obtained is located about 80U 
fet below the dam site on the side of 
the Tugaloo river gorge. A narrow 
gauge railroad will be laid from the 
quarry to the dam site, and rock will 
be transported on rock cars hauled 
by narrow gauge locomotives. 

The large stones will be lifted from 
the cars and placed in the dam by ten- 
ton steel derricks. These derricks 
have 110-foot masts and will be 
spaced about 120 feet apart, the en- 
tire distance across the river. A large 
proportion of the rock necessary for 
the mixed concrete wil consist of 
river-washed boulders which will be . 
recovered by steam shovels from va- 
rious places below the dam site, thus 
relieving the quarry from furnishing 
small stones for the concrete work. 


Crusher Plant. 

The crusher plant, which will be 
constructed for crushing rock and 
boulders used in the mixed concrete, 
and the concrete mixing plant itself, 
will be ohne of the largest yet construct- 
ed in the soutb. [t will be designed for 
a capacity of 800 yards of concrete per 
day, which, with 400 yards. of. large 
rock to be embedded in the dam there- 
with, is equivalent to 1,200 yards of 
finished masenry, 

The Tugaloo station will represent 
the last work in powerhouse construc- 
tion, and will be provided with every 
convenience known to the hydraulic 
and electrical. art at this time. It will 
be provided with a central oiling sys- 
tem. from which the lubrication of all 
bearings will be accomplished, and 
the electrical operation of the entire 
plant will be controlled from a single 
control room. 

This will be so located that the 
operator has an unobstructed view of 
the entire dam, transformer station 
and generator room. The station will 
be unique in the fact that a stngle 
operator can enter the station and 
with ®* other help, whatsoever, start 

* ous units and deliver the full 
of 80,000 horsepower to th

that have actually been made, furnish 
a network of high tension lines cen-

the states of Alabama, Tennessee,

The result is that in a crisis arising 
from a shortage of power, the tremen-

Dry Forces Work 
To See Old Year 


‘Die From Thirst 


New York, December 51.—Thirsty 
New Yorkers and prohibition agents 
mate hed wits on New Year's Eve. 

The agents, at a long conference 
tuday at headquarters, laid their plans 
for making good the adage that there's 
many a slip *twixt the cup and the 
lip. ‘ 

Then, promptly at 7 o’cleck, they 
started out. All over the city they 
spread, but the central attack was 
aimed at the great white way, where 
for years back New Yorkers have clus- 
tered to drink the New Year in. The 
elite of the attacking army wore eve- 
ning clothes. — 

Chief’ Fortman, of the prohibition 
forces, was left at headquarters to 
toast 1922 in coffee. 

Hie was ordered to remain 
dawn to keep the tally sheet 
rests, and seizures. The dry agents, 
however, professed . assurance that 
there would be few arrests, because 
the public had been alarmed by ad- 
vance announcements, 

The prohibition forces admitted that 
they were most worried by the “hip- 
pocket violators,” 

In these cases agents were directed 


until 
on ar- 


to be “discreet, but strict.’ Agents 
admitted the difficulty of proving own- 
ership of liquor found on tables, but 
asserted the thsk was easier if anyone 
was caught in the act’of pouring it 
out.

Cherbourg, December 31.—(By the 
Associated Press.)—The British bat- 
tleship Vengeance, with only a smal) 
crew aboard, was adrift before a 
storm in the English channel this 
morning, in danger of collision with 
other craft or of piling ‘up on the 
shore. 

The Vengeance, a vessel of 12,950 
tons, was being towed by tugs on 
her way to.a shipyard to be disman- 
tled. The tow lines parted in the 
storm last night and the crew~ was 
unable to gain control of the big ship. 

Two French naval tugs sent out 
to her rescue have been beaten back 
by the storm, and other British ana 
French naval craft are attempting to 
reach her.

The offiéers declare that they sur- 
prised the negroes shortly after 10 
o clock, and that when the bandits en- 
tered, Mr. Goldberg was alone in the 
store. <All three negroes dashed out 
of the establishment through a rear 
entrance when the officers made their 
appearance. The officers fired at the 
blacks as they left the building.

who entered the establishment shortly 
before the attempted. holdup in the

Offer of Klan. 

William J. Simmons imperiat wiz- 
ard of the Ku Klux Klan, submitted 
a written offer. of aid to the sheriff 
of Fulton county and the epunty com- 
missioners, declaring that the serv- 
ices of any number of men from one 
0 5,000 were available. to act solely 
under orders of: the county authori- 
tier, 

“IT am prepared throngh the mem- 
hership of Nathan Bedford Forrest 
Klan No. 1,” he etated in his offer. 
“to supply you with any number of 
men that you may desire. all men of 
mature age and many of them with 
military .training or former public 
servants, : 

“These men will be instructed to 
assist you in any manner desired 
either by patroling the streets during 
the night, or by supplying .any infor- 
mation in their power. If you wish 
these men to make arrests, it will of 
course be necessary to swear them in 
as special officers for whatever perigd 
you may desire.’’ 

Chief of Police Beavers, on Sagur- 
ay, expressed the wish that the leg- 
islature would place highway robbers 
in the same criminai 
category as murderers, and authorize 
that they be treated accordingly. 

' Must Defend Selves. 

In discussing orders issued by him 
that all officers practice pistol shoot- 
ing, Chief Beavers said that there are 
times when policemen are confronted 
by certain criminal] types which makes 
it imperative that the officers defend 
themselves, as in many instances the 
criminal has a gun and will use it. 

The last few days of the week all 
officers who could find a few minutes 
to spare during 6ff hours went to the 
armory on the ‘third floor and engaged 


in earnest target practice. Many found« 


that their aims were still true, but 
others discovered that the chief's sig- 
gestion was the very thing they need- 


Recently the armory has been re- 
modeled and refitted so-as to provide 
an ideal place for target practice. . 

“Georgia should have a law rating 

bupzlary and highwarmanry as capi- 
rtal erimes,” Chief Beavers stated.

“You'll find a deserted car near the

The police found the deserted car. 
In the tonneau was a package from 
the Sexton Plant company, of Val-

Police and. sheriff’s deputies are 
hunting through the river swamp near 
the bridge for a body. 

The car was positively identified to-

Mrs. Sexton, who was located at 
Royston, Ga., by the police, said that 
her husband left home Thursday night, 
en route to Valdosta. He was, travel- 
ing alone, she said, and usually had 
considerable money with 


Sexton was president of.the Sex- 
ton Plant company and had offices 
in Valdosta, Thomasville and Roys-

said to be the largest conceyn of its

plants and cotton seed in the country. 

The police believe that Sexton gave 
a stoanger a ride and that the strang-

driven as far as’ the Spring street 
bridge, where the gas gave out. 

While detectives are following up 
the anonymous information with the 
belief that Sexton has been killed, 
they also are making a thorough in- 
vestigation to ascertain if he is still 
alive. 

Tonight the police department is- 
sued the following to newspapers: 

“If the person who sent the post- 
card to Chief of Police Thompson tell- 
ing him where he could find the au- 
tomobile in the Sexton mystery case, 
will send us another one telling where 
the body can be found, it will be a 
great heip to us.’

nervous hand and apparently by one 
whose conscience; was troubling him.

Wilson Predicts 
New Confidence 
In Party in 1922 


New. York, December 31.—Predic- 
tion that the year 1922 would show 
that the democratic party “has en- 
tirely regained the confidence of the 
nation,” was made by Woodrow Wil- 
¢on in a New Year's letter to the 
Women’s Democratic Political league, 
made public here. today: 

Replying to a birthday letter sent 
en behalf of the league by Miss Lillian 
R. Sire, its president, the former 
president wrote: 

“The message from the Women’s 
Democratic Political league gave me 
very great pleasure, and I wish to 
express to you—and through you to 
your associates of the league—my 
heartfelt thanks for the cheer it has 
given me, together with my _ bett 
wishes for the. new year—which is 
certain to show that the democratic 


party has entirely regained the con- 
fidence of the nation.’

(CALAIS IAUME *7he’ CO 


BY FRED TURBYVILLE. 

In all fields of sport 1921 was just 
about the best year we have ever 
' had. It has been marked with sen- 
satibns, with enormous .-owds and 
new records. There’s a champion in 


every line of sport excepting football. 
The football fans are still talking 
about that. It was the greatest foot- 
ball season ever and there were more 
good football teams this fall than ever 
before in the history of the gridiron. 

Sports are growing year by year 
and there doesn’t appear to be any 
limit where records will stand or 
where the size of crowds will stand. 
The'things that can’t be done this 
- year are done within the next twelve 
months. The human race may be de- 
venerating, as some pessimists declare, 
but they can’t dig into the sport 
archives and find proof for their as- 
sertions. 

The National Game. 


The year of 1921 saw baseball, the 
national game, at its greatest. The 
public was so ardent in its love for 
the national game that the biggest 
ball parks could not hold the crowds 
that gathered on certain days through- 
out two interesting major league 
races. The great Polo grounds was 
packed time and again with either 
the admirers of the Giants or the ad- 
mirers of the Yankees. 

There are two champions who stand 
out above all the rest—Jack Dempsey 
and Babe Ruth. The latter probably 
has done more to boost the fine of 
sport he represents than any other 
single performer in any athletic line. 
It was Babe Ruth who was respon- 
sible for the greatest: interest in base-

Pete Herman, an American bantam- 
weight boxer, went to England and 
knocked out Jimmy Wilde, the great- 
est little boxer Europe ever turned 
out. 

So all in all it has been a very 
cessful year from the standpoin 
international sports.

Babe Ruth. 


Babe Ruth is a champion by popu- 
lar acclaim. 
home runs during the major league 
season, a feat that no one ever ap- 
proached in all the years that. base- 
ball has flourished. Babe Ruth “bust- 
ed” up many a ball game and by his 
efforts brought a pennant home to the 
New York Yankees, the first they 
ever won. But the Babe, handicap- 
ped by injuries and sickness, could 
not win the world’s series for the 
Yankees. Nevertheless, he was so 
vreat that his faijure there didn’t 
detract from the fan worship. He’s 
the King of Swat and will continue 
so until he grows too old to longer 
hit them over the fence. It is very 
doubtful if any player will, within the 
next few years, equal the feats of 
Ruth. 

; Jack Dempsey. 

And. so Babe Ruth heads the lists 
of champions by popular acclaim and 
perhap next in rank to him is Jack 
Dempsey, the greatest fighter in the 
world. There always has been more 
or less dispute as to whether so-and- 
so was rightfully the champion of the 
world. But if there is any to dispute 
Dempsey’s claim he néed only come 
forth and be satisfied. Georges Car- 
pentier came over from France. He 
was the best Europe had produced 
in ‘many years. - But he was no match 
for the American. 

There is no one today who stands 
much of a show with the ring’s king. 
If Dempsey loses his crown soon it 
will be because he beats himself. He 
ean do it by not taking the right care 
of himself, but there is no man in 
sight who can meet Dempsey at his 
best and dethrone him. Not at the 
present moment. 

International Games. 

The year of 1921 has been One also 
of international conquest. The Demp- 
sey-Carpentier fight was the high 
light of international sports. It at- 
traced 92,000 persons into one arena, 
the greatest crowd that ever paid to 
se> an athletic event. 

But. America triumphed in other 
sports, too, For instance, Jock Hutchi- 
son went across the Atlantic and 
etrimmed the Britishers in their golf 
tournament. But Jock couldn't win 
the national open at home. Jim 
Barnes not only beat Jock, but he 
beat Willie Hunter and Abe Mitchell. 
the best men Great Britain could send 
to these shores, 


To make it a clean-up golf Jess | 


Guilford won the amateur title in 
‘England competing against such play- 

as Willie Hunter and Tommy Ar- 
mour, of Scotland. 

Americans were too strong in ten- 
nis. The American team successfully 
defended the Davis cup and it re- 
mains on these shores another twelve 
months. 

And after Mrs. Molla Mallory had 
lost to Suzanne Lenglen, of France, 
the French girl came over here, and 
was: being so badly beaten that she 
defaulted her match, and that gives 
Molla, the American star, the right to 
claim the world’s highest honors for 
women players. ‘ 

The American od team, compo 
of Devereaux. ilburn, Hitchcock, 
Stoddard and Webb, again showed its 
superiority over Bngland’s best play- 
ers and ic the champion polo team of 
the world. 

The Oxford-Cambridge track team 
came over from England and was 
beaten by, the Harvard-Yale team and 
tied by the Princeton-Cornell team. 
That was another international tri- 
umph.

He knocked fifty-nine |

double champion in the bantam and 
fly weight class. 

Buff is one of the most remarkable 
of our champions of 1921. He won, 
both the flyweight and the* bantam-_| 
weight crowns in 1921 at the age of! 
33 years. He had been boxingefor 14| 
years and no one had paid much at-} 
tention to him when all at oncé he, 
whips Frankie Mason and is thereby | 
made king of the flyweights. Not) 
satisfied he gives away some weight | 
and .tackles Pete Herman, bantam-, 
weight king, and wins that title, too. | 

Jack Britton is another unuseal| 
champion. He is 36 years old and 
has been boxing 19 years, but. still, 
he is the boss of the welterweights. 
Some of the fans thought Johnny Kil-| 
bane, featherweight champion, was, 
getting too old to work, but he} 
whipped Danny Frush ‘so decisively 
that he silenced all critics. Kilbane’ 
is 38 and has held the title nearly. 10) 
yeats. It will be 10 years February | 
22 next. 

One of the surprises of the year 
was the victory of Marion Hollis, an 
eastern girl, in the woman’s golf cham- 
pionships. The golf followers had be- 
gun -to think Alexa Stirling, of At- 
lanta, was invincible. 

Ethelda Bleibtrey, another remark- 
able girl, stands out as one of the| 
greatest swimmers in history. She| 
now holds all records from 50 yaris 
to three’ miles. 

Peter’ Manning, a trotter, went a 
mile in 1.57 3-4, which was a fraction 
faster than his own record of 1.558. 

Morvich, the great two-year-old. of 
thé running track, earned for his 
owner, Benjamin -Block, close . to 
$200,000 in one season of racing. The 
racing folk are expecting great things 
of the colt. 


Football Undecided. 


In football we had some wonderful 
teams. There is no one outstanding 
im any section unless it is the Univer- 
sify of California in its own Pacific 
coast section. The middle west had) 
Iowa, Nebraska and Notre Dame. aWl| 
powerful elevens, In the east. Cor-| 
nell, Penn State,.W. and J. and La-' 
fayette finished the season undefeated. | 
Centre college, of Kentucky, was one: 
of the greatest elévens of the year, ' 
beating Harvard and drawing the cal. 
clum rays toward Danville. 

The last downfall of a king came 
near the end of the vear when young 
Jake Schaefer beat Willie Hoppe out | 
of his world’s 18.2 balkline biWiard| 
title. The new king of the ivories is| 
the son of old Jake, a champion be- | 
fore ames. 

It has been a gerat year al] around 
and 1922 must step fast to beat it.

Havana, Cuba, Decemebr 31.— 
Heavily outweighed and outgeneraled, 
the football team of Mississippi uni- 
versity went down in defeat here today 
before the Cuban Athletic club eleven 
by ascore of 13 to 0. Playing old- 
style football, without a single attempt 
at a forward pass, the Cubans scored 
6 points in the first quarter, and 7 in 
the last, when Romero, right halfback. 
ran 35 yards and then bucked the line 
twice for a touchdown. 

_ Mississippi failed miserably in ae- 
rial tactics, trying twelve forward 
passes without success. 

With Romero's open field running 
giving to the Cuban offen- 
sive, the defensive work with Quin- 
tana, 250-pound center, stabilizing the 
line, gave the invaders no chance to

COLLEGE BASEBALL 


‘Raids by the major leagues, . after 
baseball in southern colleges had 
reached a state of development much 
higher than any other section of the 
United States, were features of the 
spring campaign. ‘The strongest teams 
in the history of the pastime in Dixie 
provided diamond fans with a thrilling 
season, filled with fine competition. 

The outstanding teams of the section 
were Georgia Tech, Auburn, Vander- 
bilt, University of Georgia, Oglethorpe 
and Alabama. 
tue of.a victory over Auburn, 
given first honors. Winning the first 
game of a two-battle series, the next 
day’s encounter was rained out, leav- 
ing “Tech with a splendid claim for the 
championship. After winning 
than a dozen straight games, 
University of Georgia was halted by 
the Plainsmen, who won four games in 
a row from the Athenians. 


DIFFERED 
WIDELY. 


The all-star teams, selected by the 
sduth’s baseball experts, differed wide- 
ly. The coneensus,. however, found 
Byrd Hope, of Oglethorpe, and Gibson, 


‘of Auburn, leading for the catcher’s 


position. Johnson and Ollinger, both 
of Auburn; “Sunshine” Thompson, of 
Georgia Tech; Cliff Pantone and Frost, 
of Georgia: Tige Stone, of Mercer, and 


Turk, of Oglethopre, were the leading} > 


pitchers. 

Opinion was divided between Lassi- 
ter, of Auburn; Cody, of Georgia, and 
Webb, of Georgia Tech, for first:base. 
Barnes, of Auburn, received an almost 
unanimous vote for the keystone place, 
and Eddie Morgan, of Georgia Tecb. 
Was given third base. Fulghum, of 
Auburn, and “Doc” Kuhn, of Vander- 
bilt, were the Jeading shortstops. 


THE OUTFIELD 
STARS. 


No two experts could agree on the} 


same outfield with such abundant ma- 
terial playing. Esau Settle, “Red” 
Barron and “Sox” Ingram, all of 
Georgia Tech, received many votes. 
Carlisle, of Oglethorpe; Ed Shirling, 
of Auburn; Brown, of Vanderbilt, and 
“Boozer” McWhorter, of Georgia, were 


some more promising candidates who! 


were honored by many dopesters: 

Alabama’s chanees for the 
very bright at the start of the cam- 
paign, were 
league scouts. Riggs Stephenson, Luke 
Sewell, Francis Pratt and Lenoir were 
snapped up by the big league magnates 
and are expected to prove stars next 


season. ' 

The success of Stephenson, playing 
with the Cleveland Indians, furnished 
one of the features of «he pennant 
chase in the American league. 


regnular Indian second baseman made 
it necessary for Manager Speaker to 
fill Wamby’s shoes immediately. He 
had-nothing with him at the time, but

College baseball will have a _ suc- 
cessful campaign this spring, but it 
is doubtful if the quality of its players 
will be as high as it was last year. 
No sport can weather the loss of such 
stars as have been outlined above 
without loss and many of the teams 
will be much weaker. 

But some fine material has come 
in from the prep schools of the south- 
land. Vanderbilt has a good assort- 
ment of recruits and some high school 
stars of note have entered at Geor- 
gia, Georgia. Tech, Alabama, Ogle- 
thorpe and Auburn. If they develop 
as the coaches hope, some close com- 
petition is in the offing. 


BOXING REVIEW 


Rapid strides in professional boxing 
were made in the south last year. 
Pugilism, which had been largely con- 
fined to New Orleans and Atlanta, 
todk a foothold in many southern 
cities, including Birmingham, Mobile, 
Montgomery, Nashville, Savannah, 
Charleston, Columbus and Little Rock, 
and in each of these places the sport 
was operated with profit and excellent 
entertainment provided the patronage. 

However, the game is still in its 
infaney in the south, and save in the 
case of New Orieans, no fighter has 
been developed that threatens to. take 
his place among the real topnotchers 
of the sport. During the year the 
south won and lost a championship, 
Pete Herman, the New Orleans ban- 
tam, regaining his crown from Johnny 
Lynch only to lose it to Johnny Buff. 


LITTLETON’S 
RISE. 


The year was marked by the rapid 
rise of Happy Littleton, the slashing 
Crescent City middleweight, who 
fought his way into the front rank 
and who may yet be heard from in 
select company, despite some recent 
defeats.

| FOOTBALL REVIEW 


Beyond doubt football has become 
the major southern sport. Its: clien- 
tele has become as democratic as base- 


balls and at the same ‘ime has all the 
aristocracy of golf's. Its appeal has 
-grasped the cities by the throat and 
its stranglehold on the country is com- 
plete. It has not only extended to 
every college in the section, it is not 
only played in every high school, 
academy and agricultural school, but 
even the boys of elementary schools are 
being given some primary knowledge 
in pigskifining. 

The south’s 1921 season was by 
long odds the most colorful in the his- 
tory of the secfion. This may have 
been due in part to the number of 
jntersectional games in which Dixie 
teams participated. 

CENTRE’S 
VICTORY. 

Centre’s victory over Harvard, the 
close gume that Georgia played the 
Crimson, the spectacular battle that 
the Bulldogs played witn Dartmouth, 
Georgia’s Tech’s overwhelming defeat 
of Rutgers, the spectacular invasion 
of New York by the Golden Tornado 
to meet‘ Penn State, Vanderbilt’s 
triumph after a long trip to distant 
Texas, all combined to keep the throng 
of football followers in a frenzy from 
late September until the bleak days of 
December. 

The class of football played im- 
proves each year. Coaching systems 
are becoming standardized in every 
college. High school material is plen- 
tiful. The rabid support givén each 
team by its alumni has kindled the 
spark of football umbition. 

NO CLEAR 
TITLE. 

It is unfortunate: that no team .won 
a clear title to a southern champion- 
ship. Four teams went through the 
season undefeated as far as southern 
competition goes. The Prayin’ Col- 
onels of Centre did not lose a game 
nor were they ever tied. Georgia was 
tied by Vanderbilt and was beaten by 


was tied by Georgia. Georgia Tech 
was beaten by Penn State. ; 
This fact developed an urgent de- 
mand for more sectional games during 
the season and with the formation of 
the southern intercollegiate confer- 
ence, decidedly more sectional games 
were‘undertaken on this year’s sched- 
ules. «

games against small colleges was ap-

It was the most successful cam- 
paign for the coyrt pastime Dixie has 
ever experienced. More teams were

Good teams were numerous in every 
state and they played before thous- 
ands of fans—undreamed-of attend-

the southland, 
FINANCIAL 
PROGRESS. 

The intercollegiate sport, from a 


liability and a drain on the pocket- 
book of the athletic associations, has 
become a revenue-producing branch of 
college’ activity.. Few southern col- 
leges failed to come out better than 
even on the basketbal] financial sheet, 
and the day has gone when the profits 
from football had to carry the court 
burden. 

With the strengthening of basket- 
ball in the monetary sense, has come 
closer competition, better teams and 
more of them. The result is that 
basketball in colleges has become a 
major sport, the amateurs of the va- 
rious clubs and Y. M. C. A.’s through- 
out the south adopting it as their 
chief form of recreation. Better, ma- 
terial is pouring from the high schools 
and other prep organizations as the 
game develops in Dixie. 

HAD. SLOW 
START. 


Basketball, it will be recalled, made 
an uncertaim start in this section. 
Colleges were more interested in the 
football and baseball outlook than they 
were in the new pastime, and little 
interest could be aroused. But the 
progress of the game has been rapid. 

e intersectional idea is winning 
iu lherents—just as it did in football 
—and much good is expected to result. 
Already in the few intersectional en- 
gagemen : that have been played, the 
rsouth has been able to more than 
look after its honors. Southern bas- 
ketball outfits are gradually vinhing 
recognition and it will not be many 
years before the game, as it is played 
south of. the Mason-Dixon line, will 
be fully as good as any other section 
of the United States. 
A. A. C.'s 
GREAT RECORD. 

Southern teams entering the na- 
tional championship and other basket- 
ball tournaments have been very suc- 
cessful. For instance, the Atlanta 
Athletic club, after defeating all op- 
position in the south, showed her 
wares in the championship affair and 
sailed through to the semi-finals, bowl- 
ing over many of the nation’s best 
quintets in its dash for glory. . At 
the start, the Atlanta clubmen were 
given little chance to finish with any 
eredit, but the highly developed at- 
tack and staunch defense sent them 
through. 

Many splendid amateur and semi- 
professional eutfits were produced in 
the south. The Remblers, of Nash- 
ville, played through a hard sehedule 
and finished with a fine percentage 
victories, Then, the Macon “Blues,” 
representémg the Y. M. C. A. of that 
city. had a very suc ul ca

On this baseball collection are such

S. I. A. A. 
TOURNEY. 
The 8. I. A. A. tournament, held at 
Atlanta, under the auspices of the At- 


lanta Athletic club, was a big SUCCESS, | 


Kentucky State university won the 
championship over a fine field. Pitted 
against the University of Georgia in 
the finals, the Kentuckians were be- 
hind a few seconds before the close, 
but the boya from the “dark and 
bloody ground” refused to give up. A 
smashing rally tied the count for the 
Kentuckians and when a Red and 
Black player fouled just ds the whie- 
tle blew, a free throw gave Kentucky 
the southern collegiate championship. 

In this tournament teams represent- 
ing the University of Georgia and 
Georgia Tech met for the-first time 
since their athletic breach in the 
spring of 1919. The biggest crowd in 
the history of southern basketball wit- 
nessed the struggle, it being estimated 
that ¢lese to 10, paid admissions 
passed through the turnstiles. This 
set an attendance mark that will prob- 
ably stand for some years. 
SPLENDID 
SCHEDULES. 

Splendid schedules have. been out- 
lined for the 1922 seasun. Many east- 
ern and western quintets have found 
places on these lists and a complete 
vindication of southern coaching meth- 
ods is expected to result from this in- 
tersectional competition. 

In addition to the games listed on 
these schedules, southern etball 
followers will be given an oppertunity 
to see the best college teams in the 
south play in two tournaments, the 
S. I. A. A. championship and the new 
southern ‘intercollegiate conference 
championship, both scheduled to be 
held in Atlanta. Many of the sec- 
tion’s best’ teams have already entered 
for the national championship affair.

DS 


BY ROBERT EDGREN. 

Stanislaus Zoyszko, always  intro- 
duced by Joe tiuwpbreys as ‘Ihe 
Mighty Son of VPoiand,” has had a 
career fied with remarkable adven- 
tures. : 

Lbyszko’s age is variously given as 
anything from 41 to 46. Probably he 
is 43 years old. in spite of that he 
now-holds the worlds heavyweight 
wrestling championship. few 
months ago ke beat Strangler Lewis 
for that title, and more recently beat 
Lewis again. ° 

Born in Poland, Zbyszko received a 
good education and might have been 
noted in some of the finer professions 
or arts if he hadn’t been a pbysical 


jumped from two hundréd to two 
hundred seventy-five’ pounds. The 
fortune Zbyszko had before the war 
was gone. He had to begin all over 
again as a wrestler, and as soon as 
he could, came to America, 

LONG ” 

TRAINING. 

‘- First being a fat man, and old, 
Zbyszko had to go through a long 
siege of training, for he wasn’t con- 
tent to go barnstorming around the 
country among the secoud-raters. So 
for months he put in an hour a day 
running and an hour a day on the 
mat, wearing heavy clothing and eat- 
ing little. “ 


freak. In physique Zbyszko is a 


throwback to the time of the cave| 


men. Only five feet. nine inches tail, 
he is gigantic in breadth and . thick- 
ness, long armed,. enormously mus- 
cled. In strength he is.more like a 
gorilla than an ordinary man. Be- 
eause of bis natural. strength “he be- 
eame a wrestler. His. measurements 
tare abnormal. His chese is 49 3-4 
inches when not expanded, waist 38 
inches, neck 19 inches, biceps 18 3-& 
inches, thigh 25 inches, calf 18 inches, 
wrist 9 inches, and his weight is be- 
‘tween 230 and 240 pounds, 

The Pole wrestled in Europe and 
England, where he became “famous 
when George Hackenschmidt refused 
to wrestle him. Hackenschmidt bad 
just taken up the eacch-as-catch-can 
stvle of wrestling, on a visit to Amer- 
iea. and announced that he. was 
through with the Graeco-Roman, 
‘which was Zbyszko’s style. But as 
Hack had been Graeco-Roman cham- 
pion for years, many thought that the 
Russian lion recognized the superior 
ability in Zbysako.

“I was lucky 


Zbyszkos single defeat out of 917) 
contests on the mat was ib a match : 


He took off 40 pounds, and his 
skin, recently stretchéd by layers of 
fat, hung on: him in folds. But his 


muscles were powerful as ever, ands 


his endurance had come back. 

First he beat Soldier Leavitt, a 
2i6-pound wrestler, then threw Pa- 
doubney, the Russian giant, 6 feet 6, 
and 255 pounds in weight. 
» Recovering:top form, Zbyszko work- 
ed his way up and won from Stecher. 
Then he challenged Strangler Lewis, 
the acknowledged champién. They 
met “in the Twenty-second Regiment 
Armory, New York, last May, and 
Zbyszko startled the wrestling worid 
“and Lewis—by throwing the Stran- 
gler in 23 minutes and 17 seconds. 

Last month I saw him beat Lewis 
again, in Madison Square Garden, 
winning two falls out of three under 
the new rules of the commission, 
which allowed flying falls. 

Lewis had little chance with him. 
When Lewis was on top, and Zbys- 
zko wanted to get up, the Pole sim- 
ply straightened his legs and rose 
slowly to’his feet, carrying Lewis up 
with him. It was an astonishing ex- 
hibition of power. Lewis found it 
impossible to get a headlock on 
Zbyszko, who could pull his head in 
between his great shoulders like a 
turtle. That bald dome offered no 
room for a grip. 

“I will retain the championship one 
year more, and then retire undefeat- 
ed,” says Zbyszko. 

His chances look very good.

est thrill, probably, ever known by 
any wrestler. This is the story as he 
told it to me in New York shortly 
after returning and winning the cham- 
pionship by beating Strangler Lewis. 

The revolution came and Kerensky 
assumed power. The wrestling game 
in Russia was then dominated by two 
Russian wrestlers who had _ visited 
America and wrestled all over the 
United States, Alex Aber@ and George 
Lurich. 

The political turmoil went on and 
fhe bolsheviki began to grow in power. 
Kivery foreigner was regarded with 
Zbyszko was an outsider, 
and Aberg and Lurich were strong. 
Zbyszko had a quarrel with Aberg over 
money matters—a claim of Zbyszko's 
that Aberg owed him six thousand 
rubles, which Aberg refused to pay. 
Immediately afterward information 
was lodged with the authorities that 
Zbyszko was a spy, and he was ar- 
rested. 

The country was in a tumult about 
spies, and people arrested on suspicion 
were summarily dealt with. Secret 
execution without loss of time. was 
Aberg, so Zbyszko says, told 
the authorities that Zbyszko was not 
® prominent wrestler, but merely an 
imposter who used his reputation to 


vet around in Russia unmolested. 
A STRANGE 


TRIAL. : 
The authorities, moved perhaps by. 


the wisdom of Solomon, or an 
sense ef humor, ordered that Zbyszko 
must prove his quality by wrestling 


ie this turn of affairs suited 
Aberg, Zbyszko doesn’t know. _Aberg 
‘had “no choice in the matter, but he 
was in a far more fortunate posi- 
tion than Zbyszko. The order pro- 
vided that if Zbyszko lost the match 
he should be executed immediately. 

The bout was held in a big hall 
in Petrograd, packed with soldiers 


friendly to Aberg, the Russian, and 
anxious to see Zbyszko lose the match 


and his life. Aberg, so Zbyszko says. 
hired several hundred soldiers to root 
for him in the American style. 
The contest lasted two hours and 
was a 
t-class wrestler, strong and tricky.

CHICKS 
TOOK LEAD. 


Memphis, jumping ‘off to fhe lead, 
was never headed. New Orleans and 
Birmingham were in striking distance 
once or twice, but the interest in the 
race soon dwindled to the battle for 
second place, New’ Orleans finall 
winning thig distinction. 

In winnig the penrant,Memphis won 
more than one hundred games. Spen- 
cer Abbott, chieftain of the pennant 
winners, was rendered invaluable serv- 
ice by the bats belonging to McLarry, 
McMillan, Williams, Yockey, Camp and 
others. These mighty swatsmen hit 
right-handed and left-handed twirlers 
alike, appearing to have no weakness. 

In the post-seasoif series with the 
Fort Worth club, of the Texas league 
the pennant winners in that circuit. 
the Chicks were badly handled by the 
Lone $tar pitchers, and were defeated, 
losing the title of “Southern Cham- 
pions” to the Fort Worth machine. 


CLOSE 
BATTLES. 


Close battles featured the season in 
the South Atlantic, Georgia State, Ap- 
palachian, Mississippi State and other 
organized leagues of the southland. 
Columbia won the first end of the sea- 
son in the South Atlantic, one was 
returned winners of the pennant in 
their post-season affair. ! 

Lindale won the first section of the 
Georgia State campaign, but was left 
at the post in the championship series 
with LaGrange, winners of the second 
half, and the pennant. +. 

Heavy hitting marked the pw@¥lig in 
every league. Whether due to poor 
pitching, or the lively ball, remains to 
be settled, but the player was rare that 
did not possess an average many 
points better than his high water- 
mark of previous seasons.

Extension of Municipal Courses 
In South Is Helping Golf Progress 


Southerners Fail in Big- 
gest Tests, But Section- 
al Battles Prove the Bis 
Feature. 


Golf players in the south probably 


tish game to every town and nearly 
every community and the devojpment 
oi fhunicipal golf in a number’of the 
centers of population. 

However, despite the growth of" the 
same the year proved disastrous to 
national and international 
competition, and this was peculiarly 
disappointing due to the fact that 
southern hopes had been raised high 
early in the season. 
JONES’ 
COLLAPSE. 

First, there was the Iinexplainable 
collapse of Bobby Jones in the British 
amateur at Hoylake, after the Atlanta 
youngster had made a brilliant start, 
but the real. misfortune came when 
Jones, apparently shooting better golf 
than anyone in the national amateur, 
fell before Willie Hunter. the British 
invader, in their battle to see which 
would enter the semi-finals. 

Then it was a matter of universal 
regret throughout the section that 
Miss Alexa Stirling was compelled to 
yield her supremacy In woman golf- 
dom. She started finely in England, 
but was defeated by the great Miss 
Leitch in the British tourney, suffered 


another defeat in the French tourney, 
lost her Canadian title to Miss Leitch, 
and finally her American title to Miss 
Hollins, There is little doubt about 
the fact that during the year Miss 
Stirling was badly overgolfed and that 
her game will benefit vastty rrom her 
layoff, which she ig now enjoying. 
SECTIONAL 

BATTLES. 


No other southerners figured large 
ly in the big competitions, but there 
was a lively scramble for sectional 
honors, The soutlrern championship 
w’: won by-Perry Adair, who com- 
peltely outclassed a brilliant field of 
young golfers entered against @im in 
Nashville. y was never pressed dur- 
ing the week of competition. 

However. splendid golf is being 
played by Jack Wenzler, of Memphis; 
Frank Godchaux, of New Orleans; 
Vollack Boyd, of Chattanooga: Ricn- 
ard Hickey, of At!anta, and several 
other youngsters who will be heard 
orem largely in future tournament 
play. ' 

Mrs. David Gaut, of Memphis, had 
no trouble in retaining the southern 
woman’s title over a large fieid. The 
principal competition was fur’ #shed 
by Mrs. L. H. Beck and Mrs. Dozier 
Lowndes, both of Atlanta.

The light-heavyweight title is an 
obscure distinction. Carpentier bolds 
it and he is matched with Tom Gib-

Birmingham, Ala., December 31.— 
(Special.) — Tony Brottem; who

back in the Southern league next sea- 
son and ‘Will: play with Cariton Moles-

who seemed to be about the bést 
catcher the Southern league had 
turned out. in many seasons, for some 
reason -failed. to please George Gib- 
son, and was kept on the bench 
throughout the 1921 campaign. 

While with Little Rock Brottem's 
throwing was 
bases stolen off his delivery coming 
at widely separated intervals. He 
also hit well and supplied much of 
the pep and*a large share of the 
brains which went to win the pen- 
nant, 

The Barons have been weak behing 
the bat for several seasons up to last 
year. John sPeters, ex-Lookout, was 
a good mechanical catcher, but the 
pitching st went to seed while he 
was on the4ob. Gooch last year was 
the best Moley: has had in several sea- 
sons, and the return of Brottem indi- 
cates that Gooch is rated better than 
Brottem and will be kept by the Pi- 
ates,

Formidable Club. 

Molesworth is building a fermid- 
able looking machine, as well as gath- 
erinn in an army oi promising young-: 
sters. One of his recent acquisitions 
was Johnny Neun, star first sacker 
of the Martinsburg club of the Biue

NASHVILLE 
GETS ‘STARS 


Nashville, Tenn., December 31.— 
(Special.)—Having completely re- 
vived from the effects of Christ- 
mas fruit cake and eggnog, the Vol 
mags went down yesterday and stir- 
red the embers under the oid base- 
ball pot. 

‘They discovered that they own a 
pair of new performers. . . 

One's a‘fly chaser. ‘The .other is 
a shortsmith. At least the pair has 
designs on such diamond chores. Fhe 
outfielder is Russell Imus, and Mor- 
gan Irwin responds when you speak 
ol patroling the short field. Both are 
from Heber Springs, Ark. Neither 
has any experience above semi-pro 
ratks, but the Vols were advised to 
sign the two. Which ‘they did. — 

In addition to announcing the ac- 
quisition of these youngsters the na- 
tive moguls yesterday gave it out 
that Columbus, Ohio, and all the 
performers who went to that club 
from the Browns for Dave Danforth 
will be in the dell on March 26. The 
Ohio clan has asked for more dates 
in that neck of Mercn, but the Vols 
are holding the remainder of:the cal- 
endar open for the benefit of the 
St. Louis Browns. Browns would 
show in these parts the latter part 
of March or the opening of April. 

As yet no other major league elan 
hast asked for daces in the dell, and 
since once there was very friendly 
relations existing between the Vole 
ard Browns—they sent a flag win- 
rer here in 1916 for Gene Paulette—- 
th: home mags are anxious to frame 
a series if possible. Hence, Columbus, 
aside from the March 26 date, is be- 
ing held off.

.KICKERS. 

As kickers, Neale will depend spon 
Brenkart and Erickson, and they. are 
fairly good at the punting game. If 
Nisbit unloosens some 70-yard kicks 
Phe will outdo them, but in a game of 
this kind as a rule, none of the big 
kickers get their full distanee, ab they 
do in some minor games, where they 
have nothing to fear in event of a 
slipup. The remainder of the back- 
‘field is made up of McLoughlin, quar- 
terbuck, and Basista.. Crook plays at 
center, and Vince is the other guard 
with Konvolinka at right end: ~ 


ministered a defeat to Pittsburg and 
went through the season unbeaten. 
One other man, pernups, should be at 
deakt known for his qualities and that 
is Neale at guard, but~ Neale, the 
roach, has developed a star end in 
Kopf, a good tackle in Wiednerquist 
and a sterling back in Brenkart. This 
was Kopf’s first year in football, and, 
like Neale at guard, he has a baseball 
brother, the shorstop of the Cincin- 
nati National league team, 

In the Detroit’ game, Eriekson | 
showed his remarkable change of pace | 
which quite deceived the Detroit 
tacklers; but the Californians proba-

PRICE OF GAR 


New Light Six Price An-. 


nounced-Will Be Shown 
at New York Automobile 
Show in January. 


& 
The Hanson Motor company, manu- 
facturers of the Hanson six, announce 


| 


another reduction in the price of | 
their present models, and announce 


the ,rice of the new light six model 


as $5. 

‘be reduction in the present models 
range from $2UU0 on the. open models 
tu 300 on the closed modeis, 

The announcement of the price on 
the new light six, which will soon be 
ja production, created a flurry in mo- 
tor circles when it was announced te 
the trade Saturday. 

The bcht six will be-shown to the 
trade for the first time at the New 
york show next week, according to ay 
announcement made by Q. R. Randall, 
salesmanager for the Hanson factory, 

President George W. Hanson, _ in| 
revie virg the price situation, recalled 


the fact that this is the third reduc- | 


‘'.m made in Hanson prices, making 

the total reduction during 1921 on all 

open models@ef $770, on the sedan 
on the coupe 

Mr. Hanson stated that it had been 
the policy of the company to give their 
eustomers the full benefit of any re- 
duction as soon as conditions made it 
possible. . 

When asked about price tendencies 
during the coming year, Mr. Hanson 
stateu that he held the opinion thar 
@s soon as all cars made their final 

rice announcements for the New 
York show next week, that there 
would more likely be price increases 
in certain quarters during the coming 
year. Not that there may not be a 
few reductions later, in certain quar- 
ters where final adjustments have not 
been made, but that the general trend 
of prices will be upward instead of 
downward was the opinion expressed 
by Mr. Hanson. 

He stated that present production 
costs do not warrant any lower, if 
as low, as are now in effect on Hanson 
and a few other,well-known cars.

SPRING AND LUCKIE STS. 


The J. L. Carroll company, digtrib-

Kelly-Springfield caterpillar tires, 
have moved from their place on 
North Forsyth street to their new 
home on the corner of Spring and 


‘. Luckie streets.

This is one of the many firms to 
realize the value of a Spring street 
location, since its improvement and 
opening as a main traffic artery. This 


company will continue to operate their | 


filling stations at other points. 

Their telephone number hes been 
ehanged to Ivy 264 and Ivy 265. Mr. 
Carrloo states that his new home, 
with more space and better facilities. 
will enable him to render a better and 
more prompt service than in the past. 
Overnight installation of caterpillar 
truck tires will be possible. - Service 
trucks will give road service, as in 
the past, but will be increased in 


mumber to care for additional busi-,

ROADS OVER ‘ENTIRE DISTANCE GOOD TO EXCELLENT. 


This is the longest but best route 
between Atlanta gmd Savanah. Be- 
tween Atlanta and Macon about 40 
miles of concrete will be found, the 
remainder of the distance is over 
good. to excellent dirt, to within 156 
miles of Savannah, where one again 
finds the best of all roads—concrete. 


Waynesboro to Savannah is choppy, 
ith some sand, but is not bad. 


The trip can be easily made in a 


day tivton good weather. 
finder made the trip in one day dur- 
ing a heavy rain between Atlanta and 
Waynesboro, with wet roads from 
Waynesboro to Savannah. Not a mile |. 
of: the road was found bad enough to 
appreciably check the excellent speed 
of the Single Six Packard except two 
bridges between Macon and Sanders- 
ville. 
open at these places by January 15 
or sliortly after.

PAIGE ARNDONGES NEN 
PRICE ON: ALL MODELS 


The Paige-Detroit Motor Car com- 
pany announces a sharp reduciion in 
price for every mode: in its ie o1 
j assenger cars, the new p.ices to take 
.fiect January 2. 

The current Mu.ge line is designated 
as the New Neries 6-66'and New Se- 
ries 6-44, open and enclosed models 
being built. on both chassis. The 
New Series 6-06 seven-passenger tour- 
ing car has been cut from $2,875 to 
$2,195, a drop of $680, and the New 
Series 6-66 seven-passenger sedan from 
$3,830 to $3,155. The New Series 
6-44 five passenger touring car which 
Phas been selling at $1,635, is now 
“priced at $1,465, and the New Series 
G44 five passenge~ sedan is cut from 

2,570 to $2,245. There are propor- 
tionate potter val op all other models 
of the 1922 line. 

“This is of course not our first cut 
in prices,” says Harry M.. Jewett, 
president of the Paige-Detroit Motor 
Car company. “During the recent pe- 
riod of readjustment and liquidation 
we made several changes in price. 
dropping the figures as soon as condi- 
tions permitted. We have endeavored 
to méet the fast changing conditions 
'as quickly as possible and to give 
the purchaser every advantage of new 
production costs at the earliest possi-. 
ble moment. Because of the public 
acceptance of the new Paige models, 
with our great financial strength and 
complete facilities, we have been able 
toeplan a large production for 1922. 
This @nables us to offer these low 
prices while improving the product. 
What these changes in price mean to 
the buyer of today is well illustrated 
in the price history of our New Series 
§-44 five passenger touring car. This 
model when it was introduced sold for 
$1 965, We have ent this price on 
three * different occasions, reaching 
finally the low figure of $1,465 just an- 
nounced. That is a difference of $500, 
but it by no means tells the complete 
story. The New Series 6-44 S-pareen- | 
eer touring car for 1922 is by no means 
the snme car that so'd originally for 
$1.965. It is a vastly improved car. 
with a much speedier, more powerful 
and more. flexible engine. Both the 
New Series 6-44 and 6-66 mode's have 
been refined and perfected and many 
additions made to appointments and 
equipments, so that at the new prices 
row prevailing buyers not only save 
several hundred dollars in the initial 
investment but they are also buy ng¢ 
better automobiles and receiving far 
greater values than ever before per 
dollar of investment.”

COAST SUPPLIES MANY 
HIGH-CLASS PLAYERS 


Ty Cobb, manager of the Detroit 
club of the American league, says, the 
Pacific coast does and will continue 
to supply: more high class ball play- 
ers than any other section of the 
country. Cobb says the climate of 
California is such that youngsters cau 
play almost the year round, and as a 
result show class much sooner than 
those located in climates where the 
weather will permit play = three 
or four months’in the year. Cobb is 
one of the most enthusiastic Califorain 
boosters in the country since he played 
with the winter league there. He is 
now trying to buy the release of Tony 
Faeth. of the Vernon club of the Pa- 
cific Coast league.

DRAFTED I PARIS 


Conference of Allied 
Bankers Plans Interna- 
tional Consortium to Re- 
store World Credit. 


BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

Paris, December 31.—The economic 
conference of allied bankers and manu- 
facturing interests, which has been 
cons.dering measures for re-establish- 
ing the international credit of Europe, 
agreed today upon the draft of a proj- 
ect for an international consortium 

hich will be submitted to the allied 
supreme council at Cannes, A rep- 
resentative of Japan today joined the 
British, French, Ltalian and Belgian 
delegations in the cunference. 

The project, as it has 
been druwn .p in London, was some- 
what modified in the taiks that have 
occurred between the HBritish and 
French: intevests bere. it is based 
partiaiiy upon ‘the international cred- 
it sclieme of ivr. J. ‘Lar-aleu.en, the 
Dutch ecunom.st, which was appioved 
b; the financial conference at .Brus- 
sels last year. 


‘dhe idea is first to upbuild the 


publie utilities, railways and k.ndred | - 
i 


agencies in countries where economic 

aznation is due to lack of transpor- 
tation. ‘The assets of the counties 
thus aided will, as provided for in tue 
Ter-kieulen scheme, be pledged as se- 
curity for the loans involved in cases 
where the consortium has not given 
a concession for operation.

conferees as in the direst need, is ex-

definitely fixed only after the 
“neil at Cannes bcs passed upon the 
scheme. Sums varying from 5.000, 
000 pounds to 20,000,000 pounds are 
talked of. It is pointed out, however, 
that the amount of the capital is an 
immaterial factor, as the consortinm 
itself plans to find the funds outside 
its own capital, acting in most cases 
merely as a clearing house for the 
redits necessary to attain the object 
in view. It has been sucgested that

U. 8. Connection. 

Dr. Walter Kathenau, tormer Ger- 
wan minister of reconstrucuon, al- 
though not present at the meeting of 
the conference, was at the French for- 
eign office yesterday and has been in 
consultation with ieading deiegates to 
the gathering since bis arrival, pre- 
sumabiy with regard to the partici- 
pation of Germany, the most impor- 
tant question involved that the con- 
at Cannes will have to settle. 
The conferees indicate they consid- 
er American participation in the con- 
sortium as important eventuaily, al- 
though not primarily essentiaj to the 
birth of the enterprise. The idea. pre- 
vailing among the delegates is that 
the United States ca: scarcely remain 
indifferent to such a movement in the 
interest of her own European trade, 
but that Eu.ope must, in any case, 
begin doing something on her own ac 
count. The setting up of the consor- 
tium, therefore, is not contingent upon 
American co-operation, it is declared.

SHOWS BIG INCREASE 


Nearly twice as many miles of sew- 
ers were laid in Atiahta during 1921 
by the city asin 1920, andnearly three 
times as many as in 1919, according to 
the report of Councilman C. E. 
Buchanan, chairman.«pf the sewer 
committee of‘ council, to Mayor Key 
and counci] Saturday. ; 


been the greatest year for laying sew- 
ers here since 1915, and that the ; os- 
pects for work in 1922, under the bond 
issue, indicate another broken record. 

The report: further states that “dur- 
ing 1921 many miles of lateral, as- 
sessment sewers have been built, 
thereby doing away with many hun- 
dreds of surface closets, and it will be 
our purpose in the future to keep this 


sible, as they are a great menace to 
the public health. 

“Our disposal plants are all in good 
working condition, although not as 
large as they should be, due to the 
rapid growth of the city. Under the 
bond issue, the capacity of the plants 
will be increased.”’ 

The report also praises the co-opera- 
tion of city officials, especially Clarke 
Donaldson, sewer engineer, and C. E. 
Kaufman, who designed the Piedmont 
storm sewer. 


MANY RESOLUTIONS 
FAVORING TREATY 
PASSED BY IRISH 


Dublin, December 31.—(By the As- 
sociated Press.)—One of the narrow- 
est majorities in favor of ratifica- 
tion of the Irish treaty was recorded 
today by the Cork county council. 
which voted 16 to 14, at a meeting 
specially summoned by the lord 
mayor. 

A resolution was moved, proposing 
to leave the decision to the dail 
eireann, but after long discussion an 
amendment was carried to the effect 
that “as there is no alternative to 
2 ce the treaty should be rati- 
i be 


After a ratification resolution was 
carried’ by the Donegal county coun- 
cil, one of the members, Mr. Duffy, 
formally presented his resignation, 
saying he was unable to accept the 
treaty, but realized that a great ma- 
jority of his constituents desired rati- 
fication. 

The Cavan council and the Tip- 
perary urban council were among 
many other bodies adopting resolu- 
tions in favor of ratification. 

Owing to the uncertainty of Ire- 
land’s future, recruiting has been sus- 
pended temporarily to all Irish in- 
fantry regimentgy except the Irish 
guards,

BETTER FILMS 

COMMITTEE. ORGANIZATION. 
The better films committee of At- 
lanta was organized on November 12, 
by representatives of the Parent- 
Teacher associations, the Woman's 
club and the Atlanta public schools. 
This action was taken in answer to a 
widespread demand on the part of the 
public for “selected” »ictures for their 
boys and girls and in answer to a 
sincere appeal from the local theaters 
for assistance in complying with this 
demand. ! 

The better films committee of At- 
lanta meets on thé last Thursday in 


each month at 12:30 o’ clock at the 
Ansley hotel. 

CHILDREN’S FELMS 

FIRST OBJECTIVE. 

From Mrs. .Wood Allen Chapman, 
chairman of motion pictures for Gen- 
eral Federation of Women’s Clubs: 
“That there is danger from misuse 
of motion pictures no thinking person 
can deny, but the remedy for all these 
ills rests in the hands of the people 
who make a success or failure of every 
motion picture. The place to begin 
active co-operation is the local com- 
munity. This form of local democratic 
censorship should appeal to everyone.” 
The Atlanta committee’s first work 
was an effort to provide suitable pro- 
grams for children. The first series 
of selected groups of films has been 
inaugurated at the Howard theater, 
and very large juvenile audiences have 
been in attendance. 

The ninth program of this series 
will be presented on Saturday morn- 
ing, January 7, as follows: 

1. “The Goose Girl.” 

2. “Calling on the Sphinx.” 
3. Comedy.

DEMAND FOR BETTERMENT 


VOICED BY JESSE LASKY 


New York, December 31.-—“ ‘Fewer 
and better pictures’ was atk 

a policy among producers, and in the 
main I feel that most of them have 
tried to live up to the ideal express- 
e|,” said Jesse L. Lasky, of Famous 
Players-Lasky, in a statement this 
week. 

“But I do not believe that any of 
us have fully succeeded. True we 
are making better pictures than we 
made a few years ago. 

“Not only must pictures be better— 
they must be so much better that 
there will be no necessity of trying to 
convince the public of the fact. The 
pictures must speak for themselves. 
This is essential for the simple reason 
that unless pictures are produced with 
a positive insistence upon superior 
quality, they will ultimately find 
themselves without an audience and 
the producer will be like Othello, ‘with 
occupation gone.’ ” 


SCREEN TO ILLUSTRATE 
TRAFFIC REGULATIONS. 


The District of Columbia police de- 
partment has accepted the suggestion 
of Sidney B. Lust that safety first 
lessons be given the public by means 
of the motion picture screen. 
near future programs of the various 
theaters will be auginented by pictures 
illustrating various points in the traf- 
fic laws which are not universally 
obeyed. 

NEGRO MOVIE ACTORS 
FOR NEGRO THEATERS. 


The first effort to supply films fea- 


| turing negro actors for negro motion 


picture theaters comes with the estab- 
lishment of an Atlanta office by the 
Reol Productions company, of New 
York, who handle only dramas pro- 
duced by negro actors who have scored 
success on the stage. 

The subjects are chosen for their 
appeal to the colored race. Catering 
to colored theaters with stars of their 
own race,. the Reol corporation ex- 
pects to gain a wide patronage from 
the hundred or more theaters of this 
type. It is rumored that Charlie 


} Gilpin, who played “Emperor Jones” 


on Broadway, may be featured in a 
series to be released by this company. 
BETTER FILMS 

IN FLORIDA. 


From Mrs. W.* S. Jennin first 
vice presitent General Feileration of 
Women s Clubs, Jacksonville, Fla. : 

“Members of the Noational Board of

to raise the standards of motion pic- 
tures and through their bulletins giv-

FRAUD IS CHARGED 
IN AUTO DRAWING 


The Atlanta post, No. 1, of the 
American Legion, and H. F. Smith, 
declared to be the winner of an au- 
tomobile given away by the post at 
a dance December 26, were enjoined 
Saturday from disposing of the cap 
by Judge W. D. Ellis in Fulton su- 
perior court. 

It is alleged in the suit which 
was brought by C. H. Adkins’ that 
the drawing for the car was illegal 
and fraudulent and that the post is 
due him $482.50, the amount he spent 
on tickets for the dapce, which tick- 
ets, he asserts, were not used in dis 
posing of the automobile in accord- 
ance with the agreement under which 
he said the dance tickets were sold. 

Herbert W. McBride, the man who 
conducted the sale of tickets for the 
American Legion, is also charged in 
the suit, with selling to C. T. Arnold 
for $500 the number alleged to be 
the’ winning one, but instead of that 
the successful number was placed on 
a cross in the bottom of the barre) 
in such a manner that the person 
drawing the ticket could easily pick 
if out. 

Attorney E. C. Buchanan repre 
sents Adkins. 

Fonville McWhorter, who until re- 
cently was head of Atlanta nost No. 
1, American legion, stated Saturday 
night that he was present at the draw- 
ing for the number on December 26. 
and that it was ahsolutely regn'ar. 
The drawing, acemrding to Maior Me- 
Whorter. was held under the direction 
of an officer Of the post, and a young 
ladv unknown to the officers was 
acked to draw a number, which she 
did. He also stated that Mr. Smith 
who held the Incky nnumher was in 
Florida at the time of the drawing.

has just submitted for the benefit of 


all interested in development and 
progress of Atlanta a compicte repori 
of the organization's 1921 activities. 
_ The report shows that, while sti!] in 
its infancy, for energy, spirit and 
enthusiasm, Atlanta has no better 
organization. In less than ‘nine 
months, following its formation in 
April and May, 1921, its membership 
has mounted to 1,400. 

@ greatest single accomplish- 
ment of the junior chamber was the 
staging of “No Accident Week" and 
the Southeastern Fair, with Lake- 
wood and the thousands of people who 
were drawn there, was a success be- 
cause the members of the- junior 
chamber worked night and day in the 
interest of the fair’s attendance. 

Althouch a young organization. 
the junior chamber sent two delegates 
to the national junior chamber con- 
vention at Dallas, Texas, and John 
I. Westmoreland, president of the 
local junior chamber during 1921. was 
elected one of its directors. The 
local chamber has also been entreated 
by numerous cities: throughout the 
country to send its organization plans 
and the same were followed in form- 
Ing a junior chamber at Chiengo. 
Ml. The junior chamber’s emnloy- 
ment committee did excellent work 
and placed 2% men in positions dur- 
ing one month.

ard 1928. 

Three lectures were given by prominent 
men on subjects pertaining to success.

ys to get the members to’pay their 
ucs.

desired. It has been ideal 
snect and has brought the orcanization 
inte ‘prominence in the community. Spe- 
cial thanks are due all Atlanta papers.

outstanding features of chamber of com- 
merce work for the year 1921.

to approximately $5,100. The budget for 
seven months’ operation was drawn, amount-

BEST CONDITIONS 
IN NORTH GEORGIA. 
“We are down and almost out,” my 


banker-business man-farmer -friend as- 
serted as I boarded my rain later. 
“And unless something happens soon 
we'll- soon be out.” , 

This section of Georgia was in its 
worst financial condition of many 
years. North Georgia was in far bet- 
ter condition, while south Georgia 
Was running a poor second. 

This was six months ago. Two 

eeks ago I returned to the same city. 
With the same leading business man, 
we walked along the same streets and 
inspected the same farms. 

Here is what was seen: 

Many of the bankrupted business 
concerns had been replaced by new 
companies. Higher cotton prices had 
stimulated trade, but it was still be- 
low..zmermal, A co-operative grain el- 
evatofm and marketing concern 
working night and day. <A stockyard 
was shipping hogs and caitle. The 
former oldest banking institution was 
planning to reopen its doors, and the 
merchants were more optimistic as 
they talked of the prospects of 1922. 

On the farms, the farmers were en- 
gaged with preparations for new crops. 
They were determined to discard the 
one-crop system and adopt the diver- 
sified program, as otulined by the state 
college of agriculture. Poultry was 
being rasied on‘a large scale, giving 
the county the lead in shipments made 
in this particular industry. Plans 
to raise more live stock for home 
use and sale than ever before were 
being completed. There was a notice- 
able. improvement in- the unemploy- 
ment situation. 

One of the most significant features, 
however, was found in the spirit of 
co-operation in which the p'anters and 
business men were working. In the 
city, the merchants, bankers and pro- 
fessional men were working for bet- 
ter markets and providing the proper 
facilities. They were buying farm 

roduce direct from the farmers and 
ocal business houses. In return, the 
farmers had liquidated as much of 
indebfedness as possible, and 
were confident that they would be able 
to finance themselves through the new 
year. True, they said they. would 
not be in a position to operate on 
such a large scale, but through adop- 
tion of the new crop nian they ex- 
pect to make larger profits, make their 
farms self-supporting and secure good 
ields on ‘the small acreage planted 
in cotton. 

This illustration is given bherause 
it is a true picture of conditions in 
counties and cities of southern states, 
There ia yet much to be accomnlicshed,: 
but great frogress toward normaley 
has been made. Both business and 
agricultural enterprises have been 
placed in a pocition to move forwnrd 
at a more ranid nace. Corfidenes.. de. 
termination ard anpeetion of sound 
hiatineee princin’es during the next 
few months will have creat effect in

BARNUM GIVES 
DETAILED REVIEW 


BY R. L. BARNUM. 

New York, December 31.—Many 
happenings which at the time seemed 
insignificant now stand out ‘as im- 
portant landmarks in the year °just 
closing. Violent liquidation of over 
extended inventories and bank loans, 
dividend reductions, wage cuts, de- 
clines in commodity prices, marked the 
first half of 1921. After-war inflation 
sickness made business men eager to 
sell, but it also stopped the public 
from buying, the combination causing 
acute stagnation in general trade. 

The second six months of the year 
marked the turning of the corner. It 
began with stecks of raw and finished 
materials greatly curtailed, with com- 
modity prices lower, with the bank- 
ing position § greatly strengthened, 
with money easier. fe had seasonal 
improvement in business, and then dis- 
appointment over slackness in trade. 

While there is no reason to expect 
immediate revival in business, there is 
now an absence of the gloomy predic- 
tions which marked the turn of the 
half-year. Looking back at the mile 
posts, which mark 1921, business men 
seeing the ground that has been cov- 
ered in the return to normal are more 
hupeful. Here, by months, are the 
important landmarks of 1921.

(Copyright, 1921, for The Consti- 
tution.) 
Washington, December 29.—A rosy 


wan export horizon. 

There is nothing radically wrong 
with our export situation. In fact, 
thanks to the extermination of 
“mushroom” firms, whose elimination 
is really a helpful factor, the Amer- 
ican export community as a_ whole 
is in better shape toduy than it was 
before the war. The lessons learned 
at so great an individual cost are be- 
ing capitalized by far-sighted export- 
ers into better and more intelligent 
methods. , 

The two great factors in American 
merchandizing abroad, namely, effi- 
ciency in manufacture plus service in 
selling, are even more powerful to- 
day than in the pre-war years when 
they were already proving to be too 
much for European competition in 
such markets as Latin America and 
the Far East. 

Competition Less Formidable. 

The competition is far less for- 
midable now than in 1913. In other 
words,.our old standbys—‘Yankee in- 
genuity” and “mass production’’—are 
stil. with us. ‘There is. need for the 
exercise of prudence and ghrewdness 
but there is no cause for despond- 
ency. 

Europe, our most important cus- 
tomer—the normal market for nearly 
two-thirds of our total exports—is re- 
covering. Good times are slowly re- 
turning to Latin America. Exchange, 
the most difficult problem in our 
trade with the Far East, is respond- 
ing to the action of the usual eco- 
nomie forces, especially the normal 
relations between exports and. im- 
ports. 


Working for Improvement. 

Over fifty committees of manufac- 
turers and merchants are now work- 
ing hand-in-hand with the foreign 
trade experts of the department of 
commerce in order to improve Amer- 
ican expert methods and speed up 
sales, 

‘These are real working units of 
practical men in the business world. 

They know what business needs 
and the department of commerce 
knows how to get what is needed and 
to distribute the facts to the points 
wonee they will accomplish the most 
good. 

When business and government 
form a partnership of this. kind 
American export success is assured.

OUTLOOK BRIGHT 
IN U. S. PACKING 


Chicago, December 31.—The out- 


look is bright in the packing industry 
and, inferentially, in American _busi- 
ness generally, Thomas E. Wilson, 
president of the Institute of American 
Meat Packers, said in a statement 
today. 

Mr. Wilson then names the follow- 
ing factors as revealing the present 
status of the meat industry: 

1. Production in 1921, normal, com- 
paring favorably with pre-war produc- 
tion. 

2. Packing house values seem fairly 
stable at low levels after tremendous 
declines. 

3. The demand has shown a good 
volume at the prevailing bargain 
wholesale prices. 

4. Meat exports in 1921 greater 
than in 1920, or 1913. 

5. Sales in terms of weight will 
probably approximate 1920 sales. but 
at greatly decreased money value. 

6. Storage stocks low, indicating 
demand has absorbe:! production. 

7. Prices in 1927 in many cases 
lower than before the war. 

8. Packing industry has continued 
to function and normal volume of 
output has been marketed, even though 
not always at a profit.

KRECH CONFIDENT 
OF IMPROVEMENT 
DURING NEW YEAR 


New York, December 31.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Alvin W. Krech, president-of 
the Equitable Trust company, of New 
York, issued a statement this after- 
noon reviewing the past year in the 
banking business and predicting fur- 
ther improvement in 1922. 

“As a body politic we are splendidly 
alive,” he said. “The president’s mes- 
sage, Director Dawes’ report and See- 
retary Hughes’ ‘thunderbolt’ are splen- 
did affirmations of our aptness to 
meet serious emergencies in the most 
direct and. matter of fact manner. 
We have the men and we have the 
‘natural resources, and we must !even 


admit that on closing of subscriptions 
days, we were lately quite under the 
impression that the country’s savings 
have not as yet been entirely depleted 


AND BONDS PRICES 


Fuel and Transportation 
Costs Still Too High and 
Wage Scale Irregular, 
Says Piatt. 


BY @ H. PLATT. 
NewYork, December 31.—(Spe- 
cial.)--The year 1921 closes with 
business and finance in a more 
hopeful, mood than when it 
opened. A year ago businéss was 


flation which, at that time, seemed 
to have gone far enough so that no 
further decidedly disturbing effects of 
it were feared. It was thoyght at 
the beginning of 1921 by many well- 
informed observers of the business 
worid that prices would go no’ lower 
in the leading .wholesale markets and 
that there would bea gradual adjust- 
ment downward of retail prices. ‘This 
has proved to be the case during the 
year only in part, 

Thus in last winter and spring, ad- 
ditional drastic declines were seen in 
many «&mmodities such as cotton, 
rubber, leather, sugar and _ others, 
with many of the raw materials get- 
ting down to below pre-war levels, 
These further decijnes in the places 
where there had already been such 
severe reactions, accompanied also by 
lowering levels in grain, cattle and 
other farm products, proved very dis- 
turbing during the first six months 
of 1921, and business and credit were 
both seriously affected by the con- 
tinuous need for relief or borrowing 
in one industry or another. 

The declining prices for raw ma- 
terials aiso produced a continuous fall 
in inventory values and added to the 
mass of “frozen credit” that clut- 
tered up the mdney market for 
months. 

With all this drastic decline in raw 
materials prices, the lowering of retail 
prices was quite slow, while in meats, 
for instance, it is the general opin- 
ion of most observers that retail 
prices are not down hardly anything. 


A Lamb Tale. 


While the foilowing might seem to 
be a joke, it is a fact and illustrates 
what is happening in the meat indus- 
try— a farmer sold a carload of sheep 
to a wholesale butcher and when ail 
expenses had been peid had just 43 
cents per sheep gross profit. He found 
on inquiry that his 43 cents would 
buy just three lamb chops at a retail 
butchers. — 

In the lower-grade clothing lines, 
and in many household necessities, 
however, retail prices have been re- 
duced, but taking it all in al], one of 


most prominent a year ago has not 
been fulfilled, and the cost of living 
is still very high, most especially so 
in the matter of rentals, 

The second half of 1921 saw more 
progress made in restoring conditions 
to nearer normal. Thus the steady 
improvement in the banking position 
of the country, the recoveries in prices 
of raw materials from the extreme 
depression that had existed and more 
rapid work in leaving retail prices to 
the pocketbooks of the average con- 
sumer have created a much more 
healthy business condition. 

In some lines, the last six months 
has seen a decided improvement, oth- 
ers only moderate betterment, but in- 
dications that this will show steady 
growth in 1922. The credit situa- 
tion is better than it has been in 
many years, and the enormous “frozen 
credits” of a year ago have almost 
all disappeared. 


Fuel Too High. 

There is ample ground in the busi- 
ness world for believing that the 
last obstacles to u restoration of nor- 
mal business will be removed before 
long. These are too high costs of 
fuel and transportation, an irregular 
labor wage scale under v-vhich pre- 
war wages have been restored in 
some lines while in others pay en- 
velopes are still at near the peak of 
the war period rates, and a leveling 
down of rentals in both business and 
dwelling buildings has made a mod- 
erate start in many communities and 
should continue much further in 1922. 

‘The securities markets have been 
directly under the influence of the 
business, financial and credit develop- 
ments of the year. Thus in the first 
few weeks of 1921, there was a re- 
covery in stock prices as a result of 
the over-sold condition that developed 
in December, 1920. 

This was followed by a severe de- 
cline in prices during the winter 
when dozens of corporations found 
that they had to borrow money at 
high rates to carry their depreciating 
inventories and when hundreds of 
dividends were reduced or passed en- 
tirely. -A spring rally proved to be 
of short duration and disastrous de- 
clines in stock ,rices were seen in 
the early summer and again af the 
end of the summer. 

- Gradual Improvement. 

With the beginning of the fall, how- 
ever, reports of a gradual better- 
ment in general business and the very 
apparent big improvement in the 
credit and the money markets pro- 
duced a big buying movement in se- 
curities and an advancing tendency. 
which is still in progress and should 
go considerably further in the next 
few weeks. 

The investment market was the 
first to give proof that the worst was 
definitely over and that better times 
were at hand, for at a time when the 
last phases of decline in speculative 
stocks were in progress, there was a 
higher trend in the best grade bonds 
and investment stocks, 

Discerning buyers were quietly ab- 
sorbing them, in some cases to hold 
for the big incomes and yields that 
were possible at prices that prevailed 
six and eizht months ago, in others in 
anticipation of some decided advances 
in prices. on which to sell at a profit 

Possibilities in Bonds. 

At the ‘owest pofnt reached in the 
investment market, which was in the 
early summer, it was possible to buy 


by an saavey system of taxation. 
“Incidentally one may also recall 

that the ratio of reserves of our fed- 

eral reserve bank is about 73 per cnt.”

LABOR FACES NEW 
YEAR CONFIDENTLY 


‘ 


BY SAMUEL GOMPERS. 
(Copyright, 1021, for The Consti- 

tution.) — 
Washington, December 31.—It is 
gratifying to approach the new year 
with the probability that during its 
early days the world will have finally 
taken the first great step toward the 
reduction of armaments. It augurs a 
changing .viewpoint throughout civili- 
zation. It betokens the beginnings of 
a determ.nation to build for peace. 
I wish the indications of a determi- 
nation to utilize peaceful methods in 
industry seemed as strong. 


It is customary, at this season, to 
review the oid year. It bas been a 
rugged period; a period of combat. 
It nas been necessary to fight to main- 
tain progress previously achieved, but 
that fight has been won. ‘The as- 
sauit has been checked. Reaction has 
made its supreme. offensive and it 
has failed. 

The outlook for labor is decidedly 
hopeful. The days of struggle through 
which we have passed have brought 
to many thinking men. and women a 
better understanding of our movement. 
More and more the assaults on the 
labor movement are resented by pro- 
gressive, right-thinking men anf wom- 
en and the friendship and _ under- 
standing that have come to the labor 
ment in the year now closing are wide- 
spread and deep-seated. It is fully 
appreciated and greatly valued. 

In a‘dition to the struggle against 
those who sought to destroy the labor 
movement, the workers have had to 
contend with unemployment. The na- 
tional conference on unemployment 
did much to relieve the situation, but 
no cure was found and the number 
of. unemployed is still large enough to 
make the situation acute, The num- 
ber of unemployed still runs into the 
millions. 


Tide Has Turned. . 


There are good indica.ions that the 
tide has turned toward better indus- 
trial conditions, and ‘if that be so it 
is one of the brightest and best of the 
new year signs for the workers, Noth- 
ing is so essential to workers as em- 
ployment. It is the ‘oundation of life 
itself to them. 

We must concern ourselves about 
unemployment as ‘ong as a single 
person is unable to find work. If a 
million men, out of, »serhaps, four 
million, are back at work, that is but 
a beginning, and redoubied efforts are 
necessary to see that work is found 
for all, It is time that @ivilization 
found out how to abolisa* unemploy 
ment and it will be well for America 
to devote much time and study to that 
problem in 1922, This thing must 
not happen again 1f we value our civ- 
ilization. 

There seems to be, on the part of 
society as a whole, a srowing enlicht 
enment, a growing desire that justice 
shall be in rea'ity the keystone of our 
social structure. 

Wish for lrozress. 


The labor movement faces the new 
year with confidence. It knows the 
determination of its enemies, but it 
also knows the necessity of.its own 
heing. The workers understand that 
only in solidarity ia there hope for a 
brichter, better world. It will go for- 
ward, giving service, doing the work 
of civilization, enriching life for all 
men and women and children, laying 
fonrdation stones as it goes for more 
of freedom and instice, for lesa of 
rain and anfferinz, for the cafeenard. 
ing of onportnnity. for the uplifting 
of the human race. 

Our wish is for more than a hanny 
new year. It is for a progressive 
year.

ARMS CONFERENCE 
HAS GREAT INFLUENCE. 

By far the biggest event, from the 
internat.onual standpoint, is the arms 
conference at Wasaingwn. Nven if 
it stops rigit where it is, the resuits 
ulready accomplished will be far- 
reaching. ‘The fact that France is at 
this moment hedging on the question 
of submarines need not be regarded ° 
as fatal to the disarmament program, ° 
We must make due allowance for 
the fact that we eannot see things | 
from her standpoint, and that she hag 
not yet gotten over the shock of the 
devastafion of her territory and the 
sacrifices of her young manhood. Neve. 
ertheless, the feeling in this country | 
is one of genuiife regret that she is 
proving a stumbling block in the ef-. 
fort. to minimize militarism and it 
must be admitted that she is creating 
an unfavorable impression upon pub 
lie opinion, 7 

But the traditional friendship be 
tween the two countries ean be counte 
ed upon to prevent any undue strain 
and to maintain the belief that in due 
time a thorough understanding will 
be — Wholly apart from the 
efforts _ 0 insure future peace, the 
economic benefits from a relaxation 
of the burdens of taxation for the 
maintenance and production of arma- 
ment will be tremendous, 


Our tangled transportation prob 
lem is gradually being worked out. 
Credit is due to the courage and .in- 
genuity of the railway executives, 
aided in a large measure by the friend- 
ly attitude of President Harding. Con- 
gress, on the other hand, has proved 
a stumbling block. It has made a 
political football of the administra- 
tion’s bill for funding the inter-re- 
lated financial operations of the goy- 
ernment and the railroads, although 
a favorable turn in the money market 
enabled the raifroad administration to 
dispose of a considerable portion of 
the equipment certificates it had on 
hand in the open market, and thus 


provide funds for liquidation of some 


of the government debt to the roads. 
PROBLEM OF MORE 
WAGE ADJUSTMENTS, 


she greatest obstacle to overcome 
wis the readjustment of wages, and 
alMhough this has not been completed, 
enough has been accomplished so that 
the deficit of a year ago has disap- 
peared: and the record for 1921 will 
probably show a net income equivalent 
to . per cent on the valuation of the 
roads. 


It might be just ag well at this 
point to mention again the confusion 
of mind that exjsts in regard to the 
so-called income guaranty supposed to 
be contained in section 15-A of: the 
transportation act. Because of this 
there is a strong propaganda to have 
the entire section repealed. Many 
have gained the impression that the 
government has guaranteed the rail- 
roads a § per cent return on their val- 
uation. 

This 1s not true, 

The section metely gives the inter- 
State commerce commission power te 
establish rates sufficiently high to 
yield a fair return on the valuation 
of the roads. Inasmuch as there was 
no such data on hand at the time the 
act went into effect, March 1, 1920, 
it was designated in thet act under 
section 15-A that for the first two 
prs the commission could consider 

1-2 per cent as a fair return, and’ 
under certain circumstances 6° per 
cent. 


In other words, these percentages 
wereagiven merely as a temporary 
yardstick by which to measure rates. 
As it has turned out, the increased 
rates were put into force just as the 
husiness depression set in, and in- 
stead of yielding 5 1-2 or 6 per cent, 
will, at the most, vield only 3 per 
eent for the year 1921.

YEAR BRINGS MANY 
CHANGES IN STOCKS 


(Continued From Page 6.) 


,future, In fact, within three or four 

months, it is probable that many of 
the high-grade bonds that now yield 
51-2 to 6 per cent will be at under 
a 5 per cent yield, and the same tend- 
ency is to be looked for in the best 
of the investment stocks. 

Money is going t. be plentiful and 
rates for it low, therefore more and 
more idle funds will seek more profit- 
able employment in the investment 
market than they can find in_ the 
money market and investments will 
rise in price and yields come down. 

The speculative markets were dom- 
inated iate in 1920 by short selling, 
by actual liquidation that was forced 
on many people by the necessity for 
raising: tunds and by a big volume of 
tax-selling where people sold to estab- 
lish a loss for income tax purposes. 
The year 1921 opened with a lot of 
short covering and repurchasing, but 
this did not last long. Again in 
May, there was a wave of short cover- 
ing and rallies on it. The short side 
of the market had been very profitable

the result tnat at the lows of that 
month, many stocks went to below the 
June lows. One of the striking things 
about the August declines, however, 
was that for the first time in over 
two years, there had been a weak | 


market in which liquidation was not | 1995 


present in bulk. 

In all previous weak markets, an 

opportunity was given to shorts to 
" eover on only a moderately rising mar- 
ket. It is very probable that many 
who went short in August have not 
covered Vet, with many points loss 
against them in leading stocks. The 
reason for this is that the upward 
movement in September was so quiet 
and gradual that shorts did not think 
it would last long or go far. 

It was followed by further quiet 
gains in each of the three succeeding 
months. Continuously, there has been 
an idea. current in the camp of big bear 
operators that something would arise 
to produce severe, declines in prices 
on which. they could cover their short 
commitments, but staunch support has 

' heen given the market for four months 
and even the railroad strike crisis pro- 
duced only moderate declines. 

The buying has been almost en- 
tirely for men of great wealth. So- 
-ealled “big operators and pools” have 
purchased stocks in bulk and outside 
operators have bought very little. The 
-result has been that “scares” and 
““drives” at the market have produced 
very little real selling and shorts have 
usually found that they thereby only 

- §nereased their commitments. The 
ymarket has been literally “held in 
“line” until such time as the public 
‘will buy freely, all through the las 
four months. . 

The leading market operators and 
the pools know that the probabilities 
‘are very strongly in tavor of further 
improvement in business and better- 
ment in the money market. therefore 
if these things‘ do not produce a big 
demand for stocks by the public soon, 
‘they will before very long. 

Early Rise. 

Thus the year closes and 1922 opens 
with a situation that would seem to 
have been definitely headed for a pe- 
‘riod of much higher prices and in- 
‘creasing activity in stocks, Many 
signs indicate that this will be seen 
in the next few weeks, and then, after 
a reaction, renewed in the spring. 
Many of the closest observers, in fact, 
believe that 1922 will see a series of 
bull markets in Sfocks. 

The money market was in a very 
‘serious condition when 1921 opened. 
“Demands were being made for funds 
‘that could not be secured without sac- 
rifice and very often borrowers gvere 
refused larger loans than to prevent 
disaster. Thus where a man might 
have to have $100,000 to meet matur- 
“ing notes, and asked another $100,- 
000 for a planned extension of his 
business, he was given the first and 
refused the second. Probably several 
billion dollars was “frozen” in one 
way or another, much of it in inven- 
‘tories of corporations, loans to farm- 
ers and acainst other collateral that 
could not be quickly sold. Rates were 
high, even though borrowing was con- 
fined to strict necessity. 

All during the early part of the 
year, conditions were growing better. 
however. as a steady stream of gold 
was coming into the Tnited States 
from all auartere of the earth, in- 
creasing the loaning ratio. 
incoming gold to ‘build up reserves, 
leans were being gradually lienidated 
and paner money in circniation cnt

Sugar. 


New York, December 31.—The local raw 
sugar market today was more or less of @ 
holiday affair, with no business reported. 
Although the undertone was firm and prices 
were sold at 1 13-16 cents for old crop 
Cubas, cost and freight, equal to 3.42 for 
centrifugal. The committee reduced ite 
quotation for Cubas to the basis of 2t%c 
cost and freight equal to 3.73 for cen- 
trifugal, but reported no transactions at that 
level, The committee goes ont of existence 
today. Refined was quiet and unchanged

Foreign exchange also underwent 
violent changes during the year, -with 
a decided lowering in values of for- 
eign currencies here during the first 
few months of the year, a rally in the 
early summer and new decline and 
then in the last two or three months 
a very big advance in the rates to 
the highest levels of the past few

The last important trade to. feel the 
heavy hand of deflation was the pe 
troleum industry. A year ago prices 
were still near the peak for both crude 
and refined oil, Many people thought 
that there would be a total escape 
from economie changes, that had so se- 
riously affected other lines of busi-

HEAVY SUPPORT. 
POMES IN CRAIN 


Chicago, December 31.—Powerful 
support today nullified to a great ex- 
tent forced receivership liquidation on 
the Chicago Board of Trade and as a 
consequence net changes were limited. 
December wheat was the sole excep- 
tion, that option closing 3 cents lower 
after excited shorts had bid it up at 
the start. May and July wheat closed 
unchanged, corn was 3-8 to 5-8c lower, 
oats 1-4 to 1-2c lower, and provisions 
irregularly 5 cents lower to 5 cents 
higher. ' 

Trade in wheat was fairly large at 
the start, but the initial offerings were 
taken promptly and when it was seen 
that the larger interests would support 
the market, the downward tendency 
was checked. E. W. Wagner, head 
of the firm that was in difficulties. 
said its open accounts totalled about 
3,000,000 bushels in all markets, main- 
ly in Winnipeg and Chicago. 

Minneapolis reported about half a 
million bushels had been liquidated 
there, ~ 

About the only other factor of mo- 


up trades. The midsession period was 
comparatively quiet except in Decem- 
ber wheat, which fluctuated wildly 
and then slumped sharply in the final 
half hour when the interests support- 
ing the market ignored it. The gen- 
eral outcome of the day was regarded 
as satisfactory, but many traders 
heaved sighs of retief when the gong 
ended 1921 trading. 

Corn had some early support when 
the Wagner movement was on, but 
turned dull and heavy later. 

Oats followed suit. 

A sharp advance in hogs helped 
steady provisions, but they were 
slightly easier with grains. There 
was some liquidation evident in lard.

hopeful, according to statements by 
prominent bankers made public today 
by the American Bankers’ association. 
“The future of business and finance 
in the United States is encouraging,” 
said Thomas B. McAdams, president 
of the association. He emphasized 
the importance of this country inter- 
esting itself in the problems of Europe 
in order that American prosperity 
may be maintained. He said that. 
although some leading politicians and 
newspapers op extending aid to 
Europe at this time, “future pros- 
perity dependgd on the way financial 
America answers the call.”

Here’s What One 
Georgia Banker 
Advises for 1922 


Juliette, Ga., Deeember . 31.— 
(Special.)—In an open letter to 
the people of Monroe county, KR, 
Banks Stephens, president of the 
Bank of Forsyth and one of the 
best known. and most ~ successful 
bankers of middle Georgia, says: 

“Keep smiling; let’s all go to 
work; be a booster, not a knock- 
er, and .things will come around 
all right sooner or later. 

“But don’t put your trust and all 
in cotton next fall. 

“Remember, we are Americans, 
that we live in the best country 
on earth and under the best gov- 
ernment in the whole wide world.” 

Mr. Stephens concludes his let- 
ter with: 

“Then let’s all resolve to do our 
duty and to be true to our fel- 
lowman, ourselves and our God 
every day during 1922.”

REVIEWS OF 1921 


New York, December 31.—Opera- 
tions of the New York Clearing 
House association, which comprises all 
the important national and state banks 
and trust companies of New York city, 
show a decrease under 1920, 

For 1921, exchanges amounted to 
$194,331,219,663, with balances of 
$19,804,456,408. 

In 1920, exchanges amounted to the 
enormous total of $243,135,013,364, 
balances totuiling $25,075,320,338. 

These totals were shaded in 1919, 
however, exchanges dropping back to 
$235,802,634,887, and balances to $21,- 
973,388,003. 


New York, December 31.—Business 
on the stock exchange during the 
year ending today shows a pronounced 
reduction, both as to stocks and bonds, 
in comparison with the two previous 
years. Business showed a great  in- 
crease during the last six months over 
the part of the year. 

Total sales of stocks approximated 
171,000,000 shares, against 225,000,- 
000 in 1920, and 315,000,000 in 1919. 

In round figures, bond sales (par 
value) for 1921 agcregated $3.460,- 
000,000, against $3,925,000.000° in

of the 
enormous “over the 


counter” or

bond dealers, which were the  out- 
standing feature of the investment 
market in the final quarter of this

Chicago, December 31.—The annual 
statement of the Cudahy Packing com- 
pany issued today showed a decline of 
from 8 to 10 cents_a pound in the 
Chicago wholesale price 6f the prin- 
cipal meat pfoducts in the fiscal year 
closing October 29, 1921. 

The company l¢ést $1.569.563 on the 
year’s business, the surplus fund de- 
elining from $5,122,313 to $3,552,750, 
the report stated.

New Orleans, December 31.—New 


Orleans bank clearings for the year | 


just closed were $2,210,181,869, which 
is approximately one billion dollars 
less than last year. 

Local bankers generally express a 
hopeful view of business for the new 
year, and point out that consfering 
the immen-e reduction in prices 0 
agricultural products and generafly 
much lower prices of commodities of 
all kinds, nothing like the same vol- 
ume of clearings was expected this 
year, and in so far as clearings show 
eonditions, they indicate a good year 
in proportion to the inflation period. 


Birmingham, Ala.. December 31,— 
Bank clearings in 1921 totalled S895.- 
677.000, compared with $990,862 000

‘ing Inspector C. J. Bowen was fin- 
ished Saturday afternoon for presen- 
tation to- council next Monday aft- 
ernoon. 

Of the 3,840 permits issued by the 
building inspector in the _ twelve 
months just ended, 1,286 were for 
the creation of residences. Thirty- 
five apartment houses were built. The 
total value all classes of construc- 
tion amo to $11,236,776. 

Last year only 552 dwellings were 
erected and the total number of per- 
mits was 2,618. Despite the fact 
that last year’s building figures were 
about $2,000,000 in excess of 1921, 
the volume of construction has been 
greater this year, due to thé consid- 
erable decline in the cost of labor 
and materials. 

The building inspector’s report 
shows that there have been erected 
this year 1,274 frame dwellings at 
a cost of $4,916,425; 12 brick dwell- 
ings costine 860,000; 85 apartment

Birmingham, Ala., December 31.— 
Four negroes were killed today at 
No. 12 mine, Docena, of the Tennessee 

iron and Railroad company, by 
@ gas explosion in the northeast entry 
of the mine. The men were killed in- 
stantly, three of the number being 
badly burned by the flash of the ig- 
nition of the gas, 

‘ney are Herman Floyd, John 
Spates and Sam Barnes, of Docena, 
and ~:mes King, Pratt WUity. 

The men had gone to work at the 
7:30 shift and were on their way to 
the part of the mine to which they 
were assigned, when the gas in the 
passage exploded. It was a local ex- 
plosion and practically no damage was 
done in the mine. The four dead 
were the only ones in the immediate 
vicinity of the explosion at the time. 

General Manager Edwin Ball, Gen- 
eral Superintendent J. M. McHugh 
and others inspected the scene of the 
accident in the mine this afternoon. 
They reported that the passage had 
been declared safe after inspection 
this morning, and the explosion is 
supposed to have been caused from 
a rapid accumulation of gas ignited 


“by the miner’s lamp of one of the 


victims.

House Proposed 
For Peachtrees 


Negotiations for Financing 
Project Now Reported 
Under Way. 


Negotiations for financing the erec- 
tion of a magnificent apartment house 
on a site adjoining Pershing Point 
and having frontage on both the 
Peachtrees, were reported to be under

financiers. with offices in the~ Hurt 
build'ng, in connection with the pro- 

eal, 

“Tf we decide to put an apartment 
house on the lot.” Mr. Gude said, 
“eonstruction will not be undertaken 
for ceveral months ’at least, as such a 
bn''d'ne as won'ld he erected there 
eon'd not be completed by September 


The ‘ot, at its southern Tine, is 187 
feet deen, and the northern line. from 
Poechtree to Wert Peachtree, is 189 
feet. The site is bounded on the 
south by ai larve anertment honce

T..J. Ashton was fined 
a little spree. A friend d posted 
not aware of that fact, and indeed

the cemetery and into the woods, 
where his pursuers lost all trace of

information to the mayor, who ex- 
plained that the fine had already been 
paid, which put the police to wonder- 
ing who was the worst abused, them-

After the session was over Bud

recently completed at a cost’ of $42,-

building of the Atlanta system. A 
large part of the $50,000 appropriated 
for the new building was applied to 
remodeling the building already stand-

to the treasury. The school enroll-

further announcement. The volun- 
teer fire department has also agreed 
to serve this section until other ar- 
rangements can be made. 

It is stated that the pumping sta- 
tion at Kirkwood will likely be scrap- 
ped. The three artesian wells which 
have supydied water to the suburb, 
it is expected, will be plugged up. 

The postoffice, which does a large 
amount of business, has for a long 
time been a branch of the city and 
there will be no change in the pres- 
ent address.

den death in November.

World War Hero 
Shot in the Back 


Valdosta, Ga., December 31.— 
(Special.)—The remains of Paul Sul- 
livan, of Albany, an ex-service man, 
were brought here today and prepared 
for burial. According to reports re- 
ceived here, Sullivan was shot and 


:illed at Fargo early this morgping by | 


aman named Pearl 
whom he boarded. 


Graddy, 
Sullivan was shot 


with 


in the back with two loads of buck- | 
hot, death resulting almost instantly. | 


His body remained where he fell 
until the sheriff from Homerville ar- 
When the sheriff 
arived a pistol was found in the 
pocket of the dead man, it was said. 
Reports from Fargo are to the effect 
that Sullivan and Graddy had quar- 
reled, and when Sullivan went to Grad- 
dy house, probably to move his. ef- 
fects, the trouble was again brought 
up, resulting in the tragedy. In the 
dead man’s pockets were found dis- 
charge papers from the army, and evi- 
dences that he had served heroically in 
the front-line trenches in France. Sul- 
livan’® mother was expected here to- 
night from Albany.

Architect’s drawing of auditorium (nearly completed) and dining room (to be added) of the Atlanta Woman’s club, 
with insert of the president, Mrs. B. M. Boykin, and of Parker Hord, playwright, whose “Democracy de Luxe” will be the 
comedy drama opening the new building on the night of January 23. Photo of Mr. Hord by Reeves, and Mrs. Boykin by 


Hatcher. 


A revelation of‘beauty and untility 


—that is what is assured Atlanta in 
the opening of the new auditorium of 
the Atfanta Woman’s club. 

The building is so near completion 
that the administration has felt war- 
ranted in announcing a_ tentative 
opening date—January 23, and a pro- 
gram is being planned which will be 
appropriately brilliant for the inaugu- 
ration of what promises to be a center 
of civic, as well as club activitiy and 
interest. 

A drama will be, presented, which 
has been written by an Atlanta play- 
wright with Broadway’s successes to 
his credit, and the cast will be made 
up of Atlanta people of experience in 
dramatie work. The play will discover, 
as could no other medium, the splen- 
did adaptability of the auditorium to 
the most difficult test of a “Little 
Theater,” as to acoustics, beauty of 
setting, lighting arrangements, com- 
modiousness, and at the same time 
the intimacy of*atmosphere which is 
so valuable to the ideal - convention, 
lecture and concert ;: hall. 

The opening evening willbe made 
a full-dress occasion, the audience thus 
eontributing its part: to the brilliance 
of the inauguration of so Important an 
institution, and after-theater, supper 
in the handsome clubhouse propér will 


be provided by the elub’s fanious 
cuisine. 
Introductory to the opening exer- 


| 


the lighting fixtures will have vellum 
and silk shades, decorated with poly- 
chrome designs, 

The balcony will be fitted out ex- 
actly like the lower floor, ana there 
will be booths for motion) picture ma- 
chines, and a winding room with com- 
pletely tireproof equipment. 

The stage is also adapted for use as 
a gymnasium, and stairways on each 
side lead to the basement, which will 
be completely fitted out as dressing 
rooms, with showers: 

The whole aspect of the auditorium 
is unsual, combining. as it will, all 
the practical good points of a theater, 
with individuality well suited to “a 
house with a woman in it.” : 

“Democracy de Luxe.” 

The play which will open the audi- 
torium, is called “Democracy de 
Luxe,’ It was written by Parker 
Hord, now an Atlantan, whose farces 
have had Broadway success, and have 
been made the vehicles. for Marié 
Dresslar and other celebrities on tour. 
The play, to be put on in Atlanta is 
not a farce, however. It i8 in more 
substantial dramatic form—a drawing- 
room dtama, with enough of the friv- 
olous to suit it well to the light-heart- 
ed enjoyment of an epening évent. 

Mr. Hord is himself coaching the 
company, which includes some of the 
dramatic talent in’ Atlanta ‘which is

Beauty of Interior. 

The auditorium is already so nearly 
finished, that inspection of it a few 
days ago provided a very fair pros- 
pectus of what its completion is going 
to mean, 

It has been built back of the club- 
house, with space left between for the 
dining room or “banquet hall- which 
will also connect the two buildings 
and be the final detail in a magnifi- 
cent monument to the organized activ- 
ity of Atlanta women as well as an 
asset of splendid value among civic 
structures of arehitectural beauty and 
practical ‘usefulness. For the club 
women have not “builded for. them- 
selves alone.” 

Their organization has a basis of 
culutral intent united with éduca- 
tional, humanitarian and civic better- 
ment purposes, having as their prin- 
ciple, community co-operation. Thus 
it is that they feel that the building 
of their auditorium, which has been a 
strenuous enterprise; warrants the in- 
terest, not only of elub members and 
their friends,’ but of the city. 

The building is absolutely fireproof. 
Its style is French renaissance of the 
period of Louis XV., the exterior sim- 
ple of outline, but not lacking in 
ornate appeal, and the interior 
gracious of proportion, and-rich but 
restrained in detorative detail. - 

_ The foyer is open enough in draw- 
ing to give at once the suggestion 
of hospitality. The carriagé entrance 
Is at one side, with a coat room at 
hand. At the opposite end are other 
coat rooms and a.box office. The floor 
is of geay marble, and the walls of 
Caen stone, thissa French material of 
neutral gray tone, which has been 
used also in the auditorium proper 
and forms the neutral background for 
what promises to be a most satisfying 
decoration in the polychrome colors 
with gold. ' 

Entering upon the auditorium, there 
Is at once a gratification of one’s feel- 
ing for proportion. There ts an open- 
ness of outline, which does not over- 
balance, however, the general aspect 
of intimacy of setting. 

The baleony does not give one the 
oppressed feeling that some theaters 
do, but its crescent becomes a part of 
the ontline of the interior, almost as 
simply as the prosecénium arch, or 
the boxes, these last, too,.a real or- 
hamentation to the house. The one 
néarest you on'each side is open, and | 
the other three—there are four boxes 
on. each side—will eontribute to the 
beauty of the auditorium, and when 
filled, will mean much to the brilliant 
appearance of any audience. ~ 


Rich Colorjng. 

The walls of Caen stone are pan- 

nelled with gray damask to tone with 
the color of the stone, and the orna- 
mentation at the top of the panels, like 
the decoration of the proscenium arch, 
will be done in polychrome colors and 
old. 
All the hangings, including the stage 
curtain and valence, will be of rose 
velour, with fringes and cords in rose 
and gray silk. 

The floors will he carpeted in a 
neutral color, and an elegant detail 


will be the characrer of tne seating, | 


which will be fully upholstered in | 


leather. ek

Work of the Clubs. 
That the Woman’s~club auditorium 
will be a civic asset, as well as a nec- 


‘essary feature of the accommodation 


of the club membership, which has far 
outgrown its club house after only a 
year's occupation of it, is easily un- 
derstood, when the program of the 
elub’s ‘activities is reviewed. 

Why should Atlanta at large be in- 
terested in the Woman’s club and its 
auditorium or any other project it 
favors? Well, these are some of the 
reasons: 

“Briefly ‘summarized, the members 
of the Atlanta Woman's club in the 
last twenty-five years have worked for 
every phase of child welfare, whether 
af state or local scope; for bills regu- 
lating the age of consent; for protec- 
tion of working girls; for a home for 
mental defectives; for the establish- 
ment’of juvenile and probation courts; 
for the admittance of women to the 
state university; for the Biders-Cas- 
well bill; for woman’s suffrage; for 


extension of the work of the state col-. 


lege of agriculture, to the women of 
the state; for laws ‘against child 
labor; for the opening of the -textile 
department of G a Tech to women. 
Along educational™Tines’ the Atlanta 
Woman’s club has initiated many pro- 
gressive movements, as well as spon- 
soring those established by others. 
Especially in every interest of the 
public school have the club women 
worked, both for the physical condi- 
tion of the schools, for the rationaliza- 
tion of the curriculum, for better 
hours and for better pay for teach- 
ers. They: were initiative spirits in 
getting the Girls’ Night school estab- 
lished. They worked for every form 
of public library development; for the 
creation of the office of policewomen ; 
for reformatories (white and colored) ; 
for school gardens; better sanitation; 
better streegs, and for better public 
health facilities. 

“They indorsed every department of 
war work and in every after-war 
movement standing for reconstruction. 
The Atlanta Free Kindergarten asso- 
ciation hed its first meeting in the At- 
lanta Woman’s club, and the club 
nided in several municipal bond cam- 
paigns. Tifey are aiding in the pres- 
ent. Salvation Army campaign,” 

This recital of. the outstanding 
events in the club’s history was pre- 
sented by Isma Dooly, in the columns 
of The Constitution, on May 30, 1921, 
in the first article appearing in any 
newspaper to announce the proposal 
of the club to build an auditorium. 

The same article’ embodies a num- 
ber of the activities which the audi- 
torium will house. 

“The plans intend for the audi- 
torlum two additions, which would 
include a restaurant to be directed and 
opetated by women; a model kitchen 
and work room, where grown-ups can 
study household economics and domes- 
tic art,.and a swimming pool and gym- 
nasium ig the basement, where wom- 
en can have physical and recreational 


advantages.” 


It also relates the history of the 
movement and states the original sub- 
scription committee com of Mrs. 
Boykin, the president; Mrs. W. B. 
Price-Smith and Mrs. Alonzo Richard- 
son. | FEO 

More Recent Work. . 

Sjmce the article above mentioned 

us§ written, the Woman's club has 


Jare the stimulation of public interest 
in a new juvenile detention home in 
connection with the Fulton county 
juvenile court, and the stirring of the 
county commissioners to activity in 
providing for this crying need. 

Still more dramatic has been the 

long fight of the Woman’s club for 
curb markets. Only recently they 
took over for Atlanta the conduct of 
the sale of Christmas seals, and in the 
spring. worked valiantly with every or- 
ganization affiliated with the City 
federation in the passing of the bond 
issue. 
Like most building projects, the ex- 
pense has grown as the building pro- 
gressed and opportunity was: discoy- 
ered for greater beauty or completer 
equipment, and the building as it now 
stands will cost more than $100,000, 
instead of the $75,000 originally esti- 
mated. 

The banquet hall, which is a part 
of the architect’s drawing reproduced 
today, has not yet been started, but 
plans for it promise that it will be 
as useful to Atlanta and the club as 
the auditorium.: This «trio of build- 
ings will form the finest plant in the 
south, probably; owned by any wom- 
an’s club, and one of the finest in the 


country. : 
The Builders. 
P. Thornton Marye is the architect, 


and according to the president, Mrs. 
Boykin, he has put into the concep- 
‘lon and the execution of ‘the audi- 
torium no mere perfunctory interest, 
or even the impersonal zeal of the art- 
ist, but a keen and constant loyalty 
to the interests of the elub. 


“T believe,” said Mrs. Boykin, “that 


Mr.*Marye has never done a more in- 
spired piece of work and that he will 
have no structure to his credit of 
which he can be prouder than our 
auditorium. 


“His co-operative spirit has been 
reflected in all those associated with 
the erection of the building.’’ She 
mentioned especially Captain Barrett 
wilger, the architect, associated with 
Mr. Marye, and W. P. Francis, the 
contractor. 


An ineident developed, during the 
visit of inspection, which further car- 
ried out the strength of Mrs. Boykin’s 
statement. One of the builders, who 
was explaining some detail of the build- 
ing, said that he had devoted so much 
time to his work, and so little time to 
his. home, that his wife had just re- 
minded him of his approaching birth- 
day. “Maybe you will come home to 
lunch on your birthday,’ she said, and 
he had answered, “No, I think that 
will be a good day to give some extra 
time to the auditorium.”

day school and the children of the

which an orchestra followed the 
movements of the actors like a rea) 
performance, then ice cream cones 
and lollypops were eaten and sucked, 
accom pani by -delighted squeals,

sticky hand met sticky han This

hosts for New Year’s calis and a bit of holiday cheer. 

The most light hearted will be the open house receptions of many 
sch’ ol] girls, at home this afternoon for a farewell to the friends who 
eall before the close of holiday festivity and the return to books. 

New Year’s Eve was marked by many brilliant: entertainments 
at the clubs, as well as small! parties in private homes. The Piedmont 
Diving club, Capital City club, East Lake Country club and Standard

fie luncheon table in the dining room, 


which seated the entire party, found 
its decorative scheme also in Christ 
mas sugzestion, bul one that was un- 
usual and distinctive. 

In the center was a great tree of 
mistletoe as large as a bay tree, which 
rose up as high as t..2 crystal chande- 
lier and was lost in it. At its base 
were snowdrifts, wonderfully realistic 
and fluffy and glistening as if just 
fallen in a snowstorm. In the midst 
of it were four green sleizghs drawn 
by reindeer, the sleighs laden with 
mistletoe. Smilax bordered this cen- 
tral decoration, the crystal .cand'e- 
sticks held green candies, and most 
of the luncheon service was crystal.

A Veteran Worker Who Retains 


outh. 

Mrs. Robert Vines Hardeman, of 
Macon, was a pioneer Georgia white 
ribboner, and has c.untinued to be one 
of the most enthusiastic temperance 
workers, in the state. : 

That is equivalent to asserting that 
she is a woman with strength of char- 
acter, of broad vision, of clear-cut 
convictions and purpose, of Christian 
faith, of courage; for all these quali- 
ties were essential to actively advo- 
cating total abstinence for the individ. 
ual and prohibition for the nation, in 
those pioneer days when social drink- 
ing prevaifed and hundreds of thou- 
sands of saloons sold legally in each 
| minute of the day and half the night 
}as much intoxicants as is illegally 

sold in a whole year during these 
| days of national constitutional prohi- 
bition, when all saloons are closed, 
and it is no longer good form to drink 
even wine or mildly spiked punch at 
social functions. 

Mrs. Hardeman was tie first presi- 
dent of the reorganized Macon W. C. 
T. U. in 1901, and her activities have 
been continuous throughout the inter- 
vening vears, never missing a meet- 
ing unless unavoidably detained. She 
became a life member of the Georgia 


: S| phia and in Atlantic City next Novem-

ttri ed %100

} tory, writes in the fourteenth chap- 


| ried. 


: to the National W. C. 


in the book of remembrance ke at 
the national .. :dquarters in Evans- 
ton, Ill, : 

In reporting the eighteenth annuz) 
convention held in Barnesville April 
17-19, 1901, Mrs. J. J. Ansley, au- 
thor of the Georgia W. C. T. DU. his- 


ter, “On the official roster of this 
convention is seen the name of an- 
other faithful scrvant of the cause. 
that of Mrs. R. V. Hardeman, of Ma 
con, Ga. As vice president at large, 
state recordin secretary, and editor 
of the W. C. T. U. department on the 
first page of The Georgian—a tem. 
perance paper at that time pubiished 
by Hon. upont Guerry, through 
whose generosity the space was grant- 

——Mrs. Hardeman wrought valient 
ly. With the heavy burdens of house- 
hold cai.s Lressing i.pon her and fam 
ily afflictions demanding her time she 
yet attended conventions and served 
with pat: t zeal wherever she was 
placed by her co-laborers.” 

She served on the official board 
during the presidency of beth Mrs. 
J.nnie Hart Sibley, of Union Point, 
and Mrs. Mary Harris Amnor, of Easi 
mean. 

The fac that her seventy-fifth 
L.rthday will be celebrated January 
21, 1922, has no deterring effect on 
her activities of y or mind. Last 
August she crossed the continent to 
attend the Dational W. C. T. U. con- 
vention in San Francisco as delegate 
from Georgia, the year before she was 
present at the St. Louis convention, 
and now she is planning to go to the | 
world's convertion and the National | 
Ww. C. T. U. conventions in Philadel- 


r. 

Mrs. Hardeman oftén suys that she 
has sixteen children, meaning that 
she has eight, all of whom are mar- 
She has twenty-one grandchil- 
dren, four of whom are married, and 
two great-grandchildren to rise up and 
“call her blessed.” 

A Product of the Old South. 

She is distinctly a product of the 
old south, sat.. ated with its tradi- 
tions, its patriotism and its anti-be] 
lum atmosphe: . All of this she has 
put into a romance of the sixties. writ- 
ten in 1908, which will be off the 
press within a few weeks. 

The story is dedicated to the Chil. 
«en of the Confederacy and will have 
a picture of Miss Millie Rutherford. 
of Atlanta, in a costume of the six- 
ties, as a frontispiece. 

One of her stories was a prize 
winner in the old Sunny South when 
it was published in Atlanta years

The Value of a Budget 


To Women’s Organizations ; 


What is a budget? is the question many women are asking their 
ausbands since the word has been figuring so conspicuously in the 
newspapers, now that the United States with its hitherto magnificent 
attitude toward finances and government economy, has fallen into line 
with the modern financial ideal of the budget as a sort of automatic 
:ompctroller. 

Webster’s abridged still defines a budget as “the annual state- 
ment of the finances of a government” or “a little sack with its 
contents.” 

Kven women, wko must ‘still give proofs if they would covince, 
make it convincing that they are business-like, have progressed more 
rapidly than Webster’s unabridged, however, and in their personal 


accounts and in the handling of the funds of their organizations they 
are learning the meaning and the value of a budget system. 

Some still cling to the second definition—‘a little gack with its 
contents”—or maybe they use a box to hold bills and receipts in-

discriminately, all of which they have to review when they would find 
out some little detail of their own business. Others rely on the effici- 
ency and honesty of their bank to do their bookkeeping. They put” 
all the money they can lay their hands on to their own credit or that 
of their club, the case may be, and then draw on it, until they get 
a polite little notice from the bank that they are overdrawn. 

With the increasing scope of the work of women’s organizations, 
and the consequent growth in compiexity of the finances of these clubs 
groups, and with the increasing number of women who look after 
their Own pers6nal finances or run businesses of their own, there is 
manifest a very ecouraging appreciation of the worth, the negessity 
of a budget. ; > 

A very ideal example of an organization budget is reproduced on 
this page today, and a part of the story behind its adoption gives 
very striking illustration of one of the strongest points in the argu- 
ment for this method of planning and controlling the-expenditures of 
iny organization. 

This budget belongs to the Atlanta Section of the Council of 
jewish Women. Until a short time ago they had run their organiza- 
jon very much as ail women’s organizations are run with very feeble 
jinances to support very ardent ambition and willingness to* work. 
frequently during the year they found themselves so hard up that 
ihey had to give bazars or entertainments to pay some pledge with 
their generosity, their spirit of charity, would not deny, even though 
tbe funds to fulfill the pledge were not in the treasury. 

The Micawber confidence that something would turn up was their 
credit system. 

Somebody suggested that they have a budget, and when it was 
drawn up for them, that they might see all their debts balanced against 
their income, it- was very plain that there was no such balance, and 
never would be according to their traditional system. 

With this gap staring their president in the face, she decided that 
something must be done about it, and shé proposed the incorporation 
of a contributing membership in addition to the regular membership. 

The contributing members, each of whose dues are $10 annually, 
are husbands of the regulax members. One hundred of them were 
aproached with an invitation to become contributing members and the 
pledge was made, at the same time, that the contributing members 
would be asked for not one single cent in addition throughout the 
year. The budget had shown that this additional $10 will more than 
meet the regular demands upon the organization. The surplus will 
he set aside for a sinking fund and also for emergencies. 

The council met with prompt and-~favorable response, and is 
starting out on the new year with greater confidence than ever before 
of meeting its obligations, whatever may be local or temporary busi- 
ness conditions, or the “tightness” of money, and with the happy 
prospect of devoting to better things the leisure and health formerly 
expended wastefully on bazars, lunch rooms and rummage sales. 

Theirebudget is so perfect of its kind that it is reproduced here- 
with for’ its suggestive influence and its direct help to other organiza- 
tions still struggling with outworn financial methods. 

It forms a perfect picture of the financial condition ‘of the organi- 
zation. When income and outgo are thus visualized, the most opti- 
mistic female Micawber cannot escape its inference. Either the organi- 
zation has the means to meet its obligations or. it has not, and if it» 
has not. there is no use waiting for the emergency stage to do some- 


thing about it.

Atlastin. Is 
“Play Reader” 
For Picture Co. 


BY CATHERINE POYAS WALKER. 

A unique profession among Atlanta 
women is‘that held by Miss Sarah 
Chase Cowles, who, her friends prefer 
to think, is still an Atlantan, although 
she is a temporary resident of New 
York city. 

Miss Cowles is “play-reader” for 


a 


an episode. My part in the scenario 
department is. to read current novels 
and unpublished plays, then to bring 
up alive and undamaged the innate 
idea, providing one exists. To strip 
away the padding and show dramatic 
fitness or the reverse is the first step 
in scenario technique. So very many 
submitted plays are not plays at all, 
since an author reads lovingly but 
seldom critically—beyond a 
degree of ruthlessness. Also striking 


ideas are apt to be hackneyed or un-, 


uramatiec. 

“A play which is properly speaking 
a good play must survive handling 
by many departments, and must 
eventually bear the imprint of many 
personalities, so if the original thought 
is to live it must be a genuine one 
to begin with.” 

Miss Cowles has for several years 
been interested in the study of dra- 
matic literature and the craftsmanship 
of writing. She studied both in 
Atlanta and New York, having had 
the advantage of a course in dramatic 
criticism with Stuart Walker, one of 
America’s foremost authorities on the 
drama. Another profession in which 
the versatile Miss Cowles is proficient 
is that of bacteriglogy, as she grad- 
uated in that subject in a class chiefly 
composed of physicians. 

Miss Cowles will spend Christmas in 
Atlanta as the guest of her mother, 
Mrs. John 8S. Cowles.

Overheard 


it was after 12 o'clock on Saturday, 
the day before Christmas, and the 
good-natured negro who had been 
waiting his turn in line in the savings 
department of an Atlanta bank, had 
finally reached his turn at the window. 

“Please, ma'am, give me ‘he money 
for this,” he held. out a check which 
represented his week’s wages. : 

- “Have'you a savings acount here?” 
he was questioned. 

“No’m. But Miss, she say I could 
cash it at the bank, and I thought 
this bank would do.” - 

The young lady at the window look- 
ed at the check, failed to recognize 
the signature as that of a customer’s 
and as kindly as possible, when the 
negro admitted he knew nobody in 
the bank to identify him, told him 
that she could not give him the 
money. 

“But, ma’am, I got to get some 
things for my wife and chillun over 
Sunday, and this is all I got. Miss, 
she say, tue bank would cash it, and 
now she’s gone on a automobeel trip 
and she won't be back till the stores 
is closed.” 

After the negro had left, lamenting 
and worried, the young lady at the 
window was asked if the occurrence 
was frequent. 

A Comon Occurrence. 

“It happens often, every Saturday 
in the year at this bank, and I do 
not doubt, at all the others,” was the 
reply. 

“Atlanta housewives do not realize, 


| [ am sure, how inconsiderate they are, 


when they pay their servants on Sat- 
urdavy with checks, often after the 
commercial part of the bank is closed, 
and thus leave these people in the 
lurch who are ‘dependent for. their 
stores df food and other necessities 
on the wages that come in at the 
end of each week. Comparatively few 


, of the negroes have anything extra to 


depend on when the check cannot be 


cashed.

who have worked all week for their - 
money, freedom from anxiety, disap-

would make out her pay roll: before

and pay her servants with money.

might well take as an example. It is 
so simple that it is remarkable that its 
practice is so rare. 


“This woman has quite a weekly 
pay roll, since ~he cheeks up the wages 
not only for her houseservants and 
the chauffeur, but for the outside men 
who look after the rather considera- 
ble estate and the live stock (the fam- 
ily lives a little way out,of town). 

“Every Friday this woman makes it 
a part of her routine to make out her 
pay roll before she leaves home in the 
morning, and she labels envelopes cor- 
responding with each amount, the en- 
velopes bearing the name of each ser- 
vant, with the amount he or she is 
to receive, counting subtractions may- 
be for sums already advanced. 

“She makes a special trip to the 
bank if necessary on Friday or Sat: 
urday morning, gets the necessary 
funds and puts each servant’s wage 
in his own envelope. 

“She says it is not much trouble, 
keeps her own accounts straight and 
gives the servants a feeling of much 
more satisfaction .than if a check 
were scratched off for them Saturday 
in the midst of the puing up of un- 
expected responsibilities which are lia- 
ble to happen to the most systematic 
housewife any day.” 

The story seems particularly _perti- 
nent at the first of the year, when 
everybody feels the need for some. 
planning, It is used in its application 
to the household which has many 
servants, but it is equally true in that 
which has only one. 


The Blue Triangle, 
~Y.W.C.A.Monthly, 


- Makes Its Debut 


The “Blue Triangle,” Volume l, 
Number 1, is the newest monthly 


magazine to make ‘ts appearance in 
Atlanta, and it is being given a hearty 
welcome. ae 

As its name would Susser" it is 

the .Young / /omen’s 
Christian association, and if is pub- 
lished, according to its own -xplana- 
tion, in the interest of the —” girls. 

Produced in most attrac e form, 
it bears. on the front page n excel- 
lent picture of its. preside , Mrs. 
Archibald Davis, a guardi a angel 
and guiding spirit of the local ore 
ganization, and its contents reflect 
in readable form its activities and 
its aims. 

United Campaign. 

An announcement significant of the 
unselfish spirit of the “Y” in its plan 
of co-operation in the united finance 
canmpaign.to be launched February 14, 
1922, by the Associated Charities, 
Anti-Tuberculosis association, the Boy 
Scouts, Travelers’ Aideor""the Y. W. 
©. A.. at which time the 1. W. budget 
will cover their deficit for 1921 and 
will enable th 
their progran® for 1922. Mrs. Davis 
states that the “Y” girls are united 
to work as loyally for the success of 
the united campaign as though they 
had nof hoywd that the year 1922 
would bring to the girls and young 
women of Atlanta a Y. W. C. A. 
building: 

“We have waited for 1922,” states 
Mrs. Davis, “but the financial de- 
pression of this year forces us to ask 
the pubjic only for. financial support 
for 1922, with the Mope that we are 
nearing the day of old-time prosper- 
ity, when Atlanta can afford to give 
her girls a building.” 

This statement is particularly self- 
sacrificiffg, since the need of a Y. W. 
(3. A. building is so keenly realized 
by its friends outside of the organ- 
ization as well as its members, this 
realization being voiced recently by 
Mayor Key in a newspapér statement 
geproduced by The Blue Triangle. 

“The seperal public, with Mayor 


association to expand 


Key, admits that the Y¥.-W. GC. A. 
home, 56-62 West Baker street, is-in- 
adequate to accommodate the number 


“of girls seeking admission, with a -con- 


stant Waiting list of applicants. The 
home Was originally constructed for 
three seymrate families and has sep- 
arate stairways that must everlast- 
ingly be climbed by the girls and 
women. What the Y. W. é A. needs 
is a modern building for Atlanta’s 
girls and women. With limited fa- 
cilities, the Y. W. home gives girls 
the following living rates and. the 
best accommodations that the home 
can afford: 


“A room for one girl, three meals 


a day, at $6.50 a week. 


“A room for two girls, three meale 
a day, at $4.50 and $5.50 a week 
(third floor). 


“A room for three girls. three 
meals a day, at $5.75 a week (first 
and second floors). | 

“Lodging for the night for a girl 
at 75 cents. The home furnishes 
steam heat and electric lights free of 
charge. The capacity is for 91 girlie. 
Total number of* girss in home fre» 
November, 1920, to November, 1921. 
485. Emergency cases are cared for 
and if a girl is out of work she is 
kept by the home until she is able to 
secure employment, 

“The same rules apply to .the: Y. 
W. C. A. annex, 19-21 West Baker 
street, where the girls have room. 
without board, at $2 and $2.50 per 
week. Two hundred and eighty-two 
girls were accommodated from WNo- 
vember, 1920, to November, 1921. 
The annex has room for forty girls 
and no girl is denied her room if she 
is out of work.” 


Miss Bailey Editor. 


Miss Frances Bailey is’editor of the 
new publication, Miss Elsa Stenger is’ 
associate editor, and Miss Beulab 
Henderson business manager. 

“Should a Girl Be Lonely in At 
lanta?”’ “Why Join the Y. W. C. A.?”’ 
news of the clubs within the organ- 
ization, are some of the interesting 
articles, and two campaigns are an- 
nounced, one in the nature of a con- 
test. a national affair promoted by 
the National League for the Preven- 
tion of Spinal Curvature, which of- 
fers $1.000 in prizes for the woman 
over 18 with the most nearly perfect 
spine, and the other a health week 
to be launched by the Woman's clu 
looking to “better feet.”

For exerciSe is the prime correction of a 
weak (or fallen) arch., The muscles and lig-

their normal position if given a chance to re-

Cantilever flexibility is good jor the well

should keep them‘ strong by wearing flexible, 
good-fitting shoes. : 

And .if you are one of the unfortunate suf-

ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR. 
By Mrs. Rose M. Ashby, P. G. M. 
The Order of the Eastern Star is 


au.American adoptive rite of Masonry 
of five degrees. ‘Those who are @i- 
gible to membership in this ofder are 
Master Masons, the wives, daughters, 
mothers, widows and sisters of Master 
Masons. 

It has been quite a prevalent idea 
that this order is- exclusively -a wom- 
an’s order, but while the first officer 
in any chapter must be a woman, the 
second office is filled by a man. 

This order is the largest and most 
thoroughly organized order of its kind 
in the world. It has over a million 
members. There is the general grand 
chapter of the world. Every state in 
the union is organized into a grand 
jurisdiction, and al] are affiliated with 
the general grand chapter except New 
York and New Jersey, which are. inde- 
pendent grand jurisdictions, There 
are about six of the Canadian prov- 


ince. organized into, grand chapters, 


affiliated with the 
also Porto Rico. . 

“Then there is-the supreme grand 
chapter of Scotland and many Subordi- 
nate chapters all over the world ‘work- 
ing under the immediate jurisdiction 
of either the general grand or the su- 
preme grand of. Scotland. 

The same identical ritual is used in 
all chapters. The principles are the 
same, the aims and purposes are the 
same, the general regulations are the 
same thtoughout. 

Mrs, Ella “Lines Chapin, of Pine 
Meadow, Conn., is the head officer of 
the general grand eHapter; Dr. Al- 


neral grand, as is 


is its second official. 


Grand Chapter of Georgia. 

The Grand Chapter O. E. 8S. of Geor- 
gia was organized about twenty years 
ago, and approxi mete there are 145 
chapters. at preseft, with a large and 
rapidly incggasing niembership. 

The present. elective grand officers 
of the state are Mrs. Nancy Heard 
Davis, of / Lexington, grand matron; J. 
Harry Johnson, of Augusta, grand 
patron; Mrs. Rowena Ward, Arling- 
ton, associate grand matron; William 
Clarke, of Savannah, associate grand 
patron; Mrs. Mattie Colquitt, of Cor- 
dele, grand secretary; Mrs. Anna Bul- 
loch, of Eullochville, grand treasurer: 
Mrs. Eva Sutton, of Macon, grand 
conductress; Mrs. Maude Johnson, of 
Augusta, associate grand conductress. 
The next annual session will be held 
in' Macoh the last Tuesday in May. 

0.. E. S. Educational Fund. 

Among the special work that the O. 
E. S. has done in Georgia was to 
raise $5,000 as the nucleus of a per- 
manent educational fund to help give 
special commercial or industrial train- 
ing to the boys and girls of the Ma- 
sonic home of Georgia. This fund has 
long since been completed and is con- 
stantly growing, and much good and 
benefit has been thus disseminated. 


0. E. S. Activities. 

When the Masonic home was built 
the Eastern'Star of the state was 
privileged to furnish the dining room 
of this home, and the furnishings and 
essentials of this*room are e¢arefully 
looked after and kept up by the order. 

At this special season each chapter 
in the state is taking an interest in,

A 


First Womans’ Club 


‘The first club. formed by women in 


erty. Two buildings were falling with 


America, and perhaps in the world,!decay; the portico of the mansion it- 
was formed by Ann Pamela Cunning- | self was propped up and supported 


ham. of Rosmonde, Laurens county, 


South Carolina, in 1853, when she 
founded the “Mount Vernon Ladies’ 
asociation,” for the preservation, or 
rather restoration, of this historical 
place as a national shrine. 

Every year articles are written, 
speeches mage and the question agi- 
tated that the government should 
t...@ Mount Vernon and throw the 
cates open to the public. ‘The small 
fee of 25 cents only is charged to 
help in its unkeep and once a week 


by pines from the forest. At last 
he felt forded to offer the histori 
place for sale, first to congress as 
his great desire at that time was that 
the nation should pay the respect to 


,its great first president by owning the 


site o-. his home and temb. He offered 
it to the United St&tes government 
for $200,000. ‘The government de- 
clined to purchase. le then turned 
to the state of Virginia, offering it 
at the same price. The native state 
of the great man also declined to pur- 


for means, and there seemed no pros- 
pect -of -improvement in: his circum- 
stances. Ap 

A Young Girl’s Plan. ~— 

It was about this time that Ann 
Pamela Cunningham, a’ young girl, 
living im -her country home, “‘Rose- 
mont,” .im great: retirement, owing to 
great ‘suffering from spinal ‘trouble 
which confine* her to her bed most 
of .the time, received a letter from 
her mother, visiting in Washington. 
She wrote -in~pencil on her knee as 
the steamboat. glided down the beau- 
tiful, Potomac, desiring to share with 


her daughter’ as much as “ossible, the | 


delights of travel, which she could 
never enjoy. As they passed in front 
of Mount Vernén the bell of the 
steamer tolled in reverent salutation 
of the sacred spot. Mrs. Cunning- 
ham told of the solemn effect and 
continued with this sentence. “What 
@ great destiny it would be if the 
women ot America could buy this 
sacred spot and preserve it as a shrine 
for the nation.” 

The young girl read the letter 
while in great: pain but said at once, 
“I will do it.” Her. family and 
friends tried to laugh her out of the 
idea. “Raise $200.000!, It was an 
impossibility—a folly to contemplate. 
At that time it was not considered 


first woman’s association ever formed 
in these United States of America. 
Each state was to have a presiding 
officer with th- title of vice regent— 
and the power to raise funds for the 
purchase of Mount Vernon—and have 
also the power to appoint officers and 
committees. in her state, to raise 
m.ney and, place it in secure banks 
until the time came for the payments 
to be made. 

All over the country school chil- 
dren gave five cents apiece. “The en- 
thusiasm grew and before the end 
of 1859 the huge sum of $200,000 was 
raised. Now e an unexpected dif- 
ficulty. ' John Augustine Washing- 
ton refused to sell to a party of wom- 
en. Miss Cunningham felt she must 
see him and make him understand 
the vision. She made the terrible ef- 
fort of journeying to Washington, 
part of the time on-a cot. At last 
she reached Mount. Vernon and was 
received by Mr. Washington and laid 
before him the plans, aspirations, and 
ideals of the association, He listened 
coldly and refused ‘absolutely to sell 
the estate to them. In despaf® Miss 
Cunningham left him, and was carried 
down to the boat, only to find a 
storm threatened and the boat had 
left her. Her strong faith nearly [eft 
her here for her reception had not 
been cordia!, and there was no plaee 


raised up to preserve and glorify the ; gate thereby becoming @ sharer in the 


memory of his great relative and keep 
this sacred spot as a shrine. She 

ld of the constitution of the associa- 
tion which the great lawyer, James 
Petigru, had drawn for her—how the 
titles to the estate were to b vested 


iy the state of Virginia—to whom the 


property was to revert should the 
association ever fail to do its duty in 
carrying out the original intention 
of the purchasers. He was’ greatly 
impressed and when they met the next 
morning he gave his full unqualified 
eonsent to the sale. 

The $200,000 was paid over in 1860 
and Mount Vernon became the. prop- 
erty of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ 
association. The struggles began for 
the war between the states came. 
All the money bad been paid out, 
there was no means of raising any 
more at that time. All during the 
war the place was occupied solely 
by Miss Cunningham’s secretary, Miss 
Tracy, and an old gentleman, Mr. Her- 
pert. The soldiers of the two armies 
respected and protected the place 
equally. Sometimes they met there 
as on equal ground and exchanged 
tobacco and jokes. There could not 
be paid a greater tribute to the uni- 
versal love of Washington. 

Old Relics Rebought. 


As soon fas normal conditions re- 


upkeep of the beautiful place, which 
now is as nearly perfect as can be. 
the mansion furnished as it was when 
Washington lived there, the gardens 
grounds, the outbuildings, everything 
just as he looked out on them. 


The Organization. 


The association now consists of one 
regent, the head of everything, and 


a vice regent from each state, as far | 
as it has been péssible to get one, : 


the effort being to get the very best | o¢ boys remained on the campus. 


and highest type of womanhood in 
each state, who give their 
thoughts and services as guardians 
of Mount Vernon absolutely without 
money and without price. The con- 
stitution provides that their traveling 
expenses to and from Mount Vernnon 
once a year to attend the grand ¢dun- 
cil in May shall be, paid from the 
treasury, but thesef\sponsors never 
aecept it. 

Now that all the wark is done al! 
the strain and stress of those early 
years over and no one taxed for the 
mantenance of ths beautful home and 
shrine; no one called upon to assist 
in any way; the place a pride and joy 
to all; the first place visited and hon- 
ored by all the great ones of the world 
who come to America, there comes a 
clamoring from some needy and shifty 
politicians and so-called patriotic so- 


time, |

However. when Mr. Washington 
heard she had been left by the boat, 
his instinct as host prewailed. He 
came forward, the true Virginia gen-

house, and she was delightfully wel- 
comed and entertained by the family. 
Sitting around the fire that night, 
for the first time Mr. Washington 
realized that this was no ordinary

Personalities and Politics 


Mrs. R. H. Hankinson, of McDonough, the very alert and result- 
getting president of thé Sixth District Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
is quoted on the Federation page today on a subject which is very 
closely tied up with the history of the State Federation, and the char- 
acter of the women composing it. 

She states that the pendulum of Federation interests has been 
swinging overwhelmingly of late in the direction of civics and charity, 
and while she pays tribute to the clubwomen for their alertness to 
perceive the necessity for civic information and co-operation, and for 
charitable activities in the broad sense of works of love, especially in 
education, yet she urges that the clubwomen do not lose sight of the 
value of their study departments. P 

The beginning of the Federation was in study clubs, and its devel- 
opment out of a nucleus of conservative, but active-minded women, 


eager to devélop their intellect and to broaden their ‘vision, has, to a 
great extent, been the guiding influence in the Federation’s history of | 
level-headed, sane activity. 

It was not the desire for radical changes which brought the led- 
eration into existence. Nor was it a desire for active participation in | 
public affairs. It was in the natural course of women’s evolution 
which had arrived at the stage when’ all of their time need not be | 
spent in home industry, and they had begun to lock beyond their own 


more*nearly what it ought to be. : gees stig 
Thus politics as to things within the organization, and radicalism 


as to things outside, have never taken hold. It is one of the proudest | 
‘yoasts of the Federation that for twenty-five years they have thus been | 
able to work together, with personalities put forward only as they:rep- 
present work well done, and with the Federation’s activities, as they 
reach beyond the clubs themselves, being well planted and carefully 
considered before they are launched. In these important respects the 
Federation may well serve as a model for womens organizations.

Address by Mrs. Hankinson 


MRS. FORF,,E. LAND 7 


Newly elected president Macon 


One of the most interesting meet- 
ings of federated club women held 
in Georgia this fall was the annual 
meeting of the Macon City Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs, when Mrs. 
Fort E. Land was elected president. 
A strong corps of women was select- 
ed to fill.all the offices, and experts 
on several of the lines of work in 
which club women are devoting their 
best effort, or expect to, were among 
the speakers. 

A distinguished visitor was Mrs. 
R. H. Hankinson, of McDonough, 
president of the Sixth District Fed- 
eration of. Women’s Clubs, in whieh 
the Macon federation is a conspicuous 
Mrs. Hankinson, in her ade 


wogram and mue¢h of her address 
it the nail on the “head as straight 
in its relation to the work of club 
women in every section of Georgia,. as | 
in the sixth district. 

“IT hope you will go out, all of you, 
with more fervent spirit in ‘the new 
year than you have ever had, to 
preach the possibilities of the fed- 
eration,’ said Mrs. Hankinson. 

“I would urge that you keep up- 
permost in mind your great respon- 
sibility in scholarships and the Stu- 
dent Aid foundation, .Let girls. in 


your communities, who are ambitious | 


for an education and cannot see their’ 
way clear to it, know that if is the 
dearest wish of the federgted club 
women of Georgia that every Geor- 
gia girl, who will take an education, 
should have it. Let every club give 
at least one entertainment solely for 
the support of Tallulah Falis School 
and Student Aid, so that we ean sub- 
stantially back up this ambition. 
Horizon of the Home, 
“Stress the home in all, of your 
work, not just in the limited sense 


of the space within four walls, but 


everything in your community, your 
state, your country that has its re- 
action on the home. Cultivate in 
yourselves and encourage among wom- 
en a large vision which will see these 
interests in their true relation to the 
home. 

“Get the true club spirit. Learn 
co-operation, preach it and practice 
it. Try compromise when necessary, 
if compromise will mean constructive 
harmony. 

“Study every department of your 
club work. 

“There is Americanization, for in- 
stance. Do you belong to a club 


‘that still thinks it has no work to 
' do in this ling because it belongs to 
| @ community in whicl’ there are no 


foreign-born? 


If you are, urge your 
fellow i 


clubwomen to study Ameri- 


Federation of Women’s Clubs. 


ecanization in its true sense. Literal- 
ly it means to make Americans, and 
that means primarily education. 

“Study citizenship. Our, own Mrs. 
Nellie Peters Black had a~ slogan 
which could well apply to us women 
to our present situation as to civic 
activities, ‘Before you do anything, sit 
down and sanely think.’ Men. in 
public life will be forgiven. their mis- 
takes, women never. 

“The women will be a power, there- 
fore let us be ‘sure that we stand 
always fot the right thing, and that 
the right people are put into office. 

“I would urge, however, that we 
should give more attention this year 
than we have been doing to our study 
departments. The pendulum of: club 
work«has been swinging to civics and 
charity. * Let us not neglect, however, 
the cultural things that make us -well 
rounded women with an intensified 
power of thinking straight, and also 
we must not minimize the:value of 
the refinement, the charm, which it is 
every woman’s duty and her privilege 
as far as she ean to enhance.” 

On this latter line Mrs.. Hafikinson 
urged that in her own distfict. the 
work of the music department ~ be 
Strengthened. While the sixth district 
boasts the only musie¢e teachers’ asso- 
ciation in the state, yet “there are 
only four music clubs in: the district, 
The song and poetry contest she em- 
phasized as of considerable value in 
promoting interest in the study de- 
partments of federatidn work. 

Road of Remembrance. 
‘ Concerning one of the club women’s 
greatest obligations, that of patriotism. 
she paid tribute to Bibb county’s 


‘Road of Remembrance,” inspired by | 
the club women, ‘and now being pushed | 


by them to completion. 


This road, lined with its memorial 
groves, intersecting in Macon, Ga.. 
and forming a great cross, is to be 
in memory of the men who gave their 
lives in the world war. In the words 
of Mrs. Hankinson it will be a me- 
morial likewise to the women whio 
inspired it. | 

She called attention to the new 
emphasis to be put on co-operation 
with the state board of public wel- 
fare in the.statéSurvey of jails, an: 
asked that every club should appoin: 
its chairman for jails@to serve wit): 
the state welfare board. She expresve:! 
the hope that the women of the dis 
trict would get behind the movement for 
a national park to be made from tke 
forest reservation in north Georgia. 

Mrs. E. R. Harmount,. president «f 
the Community club of Macon, was 
appointed chairman for Bibb county | 


committee on jails.

University and Club Women 


Combine on 


Social Program 


“The body of our education must

sor, but there must be a spirit in 
it which looks to the welfare of 
the state.” 

DAVID C. BARROW, 
Chancellor of the University of. 
Georgia. 
a 


One of the most vitai steps in the 
| extension work of the University of 
| Georgia—that work which is taking 
the university to the people—is the 
program which is bringing togethe: 
the seasoned experience of the uni- 
versity’s social service specialists with 
the inquiring minds of the club wom. 
en of Georgia, eager to know, and 
thus to act intelligently in matters 
that concern the social welfare of 
their communities, their state. ° 
James L. Sibley. extension profes. 
sor of social work, has prepared a 
pamphlet, which will be ont.of the 
hands of the publishers and reedy for

club women, conscious of the need 
for general co-operation in matters 
of public welfare and eager for the 
right kind of guidance in fitting 
themselves for this work. 

Professor Sibley calls this pamphlet 
“Some Studies in Local Government

use of women’s clubs, and he ex.

THE BROADWAY a 
ATATLANTA THEATER 


Returns to Atlanta With 
Cast of Musical Com- 
edy Stars. 


At the Atlanta theater (tomorrow) 
Monday matinee the “Broadway 
Wijri” returns to Atlanta for a 
week's engagement. 

The “Whirl” is 2n aggregation of good 
things that proves anew that life is 
well worth the living, and that if there 
be gloom, hanging round kind nature 
and the Artists’ Producers corpora- 
tion have the means to successfully 
put it to rout. “The Broadway 
Whirl” is one of the greatesf anti- 


“dotes to earthly misery révealed dur- 


ing the theatrical season, and seek- 
ers after real pleasure will find the 
Atlanta their coveted haven. 

The beauty about this show is that 
it is not a flash in the pan. It starts 
at high speed and seems to, gather 
momentum every moment. One spar- 
kling feature follows andéther so rap- 
idiy that the spectator may be par- 
doned if he feels just a little lost or 
confused by the rotary motion. 

‘The “Whirl” goes its merry way re- 
yealing colorful effects, wrought by 
artistic’ hands, and. striking scenes 
a ranged by expert artists. There is 
« chorus of girls that is good to look 
upon, collectively or Mdividually, with 
eostumes that makes the spectator 
keep his eye alert and his mind open 
for further beauties. The scenes are 
the many stage pictures 
showing fine judgment and artistic 
feniperament and taste. 

The girls of the chorus. are kindly 
and vivacious, and generally ramble 
through the aisles, burnishing the fin- 
ger nails of the tickled-to-death men, 
and appealing to masculine hands to 
button up their backs, meeting with 
no refusals. 

‘ The “Whirl” has a cast that makes 
it-notable among the stage offering 
of this season, including Blanche 
Ring, Charles Winninger, Winona 
Winter, Jay Gould and several others 
whose ability none can question. Miss 
Ring is truly “Belle Broadway,” and 
spe is so bright that the city high- 
way that bears her name ‘might well 
be glad to bask in her glory. Winona 
Winter does some of the best work of 
her stage career in this revue. Charles 
Winninger is a comedian of many ac- 
tivities, enhancing the reputation he 
had previously won as a funmaker of 
distinetive manner and varied talents. 

ay Gould is another whose work 
has a refreshing air. of  breeziness, 
which helps a great deal to help the 

“Whirl” ¥ round. The work of Virgin- 
ja Birmingham and Gertrude McDon- 
ald is very fine. Gertrude MeDonald 
also does an excellent dance. eeccen- 
trique with Inez Courtney. There are 
dances by Maxson and Brown, who 
also lead the toddle-toup number, 
baseball game with the audience by 
eizht girls, a comedy in the passport | 


and income tax office, delizhtful “Baby | 


Dolls” with Nina Pennington and 
a Ross and a dozen animated 
dolis ; 
other hegre equally pleasing. 

The rousic by Harry ‘Tierney and 


the lyrics are worthy of the occasion. 
Thomas J. Gray is credited with the 
dialogue and comedy scenes. 

“The Broadway Whirl’® is a glit- 
tering and speedy show, with not a 
gray moment ir it. Only two mati- 
nees will be cziven during the week, a 
popular holiday matinee tomorrow, 
(Monday) and the regular matinee on 
Saturday.

THE GREAT KERMISS- 
SINS WOMAN I 


Sensational Act Heads Fine 
Program at Loew’s Grand 
Theater. 


ew 


If the program as provided for the 
first week of the New Year at Léew’s 
Grand theater is an indication of the 
class of entertainment for the com- 
ing year then indeed are Atlanta thea- 
ter-goers to be favored with the best 
obtainable in vaudeville. On the pro- 
gram of five high-class acts for the 
‘first half of the week is one of the 
greatest sensations ever conceived by 


man. Its title, “Sawing a Woman in 
Two,” gives an inkling as to its na- 
ture. The act is crowding new thea- 
ters nightly and completely mystifies 
ali-who see it. The screen program 
for these three days also offers some- 
thing extraordinary in the appear- 
ance of Pearl White in what is-with- 
out doubt one of the best pictures she 
has ever starred in, “Any Wife” is 
the sort of a picture that appeals to 
all kinds of people and lingers in ones 
memory for a long time after view- 
ing it. 

The Great Kermiss, who is present- 
ing the mystery of the twentieth cen- 
tury, “Sawing a Woman in Two,” 
has just returned to this country from 
an extensive tour of the Orient. The 
operation is performed with the aid of 
a rough pine box such as is used by 
undertakers, only it is not as long. It 
is nailed with common roofing nails. 
A young lady weighing about 135 
rounds and five feet, seven inches high, 
is placed in the box. After an inspec- 
tion of the box and platform upon 
which it is placed, by a committee of 
from one to twenty, the young lady is 
sawed completely in two in full view 
of the audience. Kermiss extends an 
invitation to those who are skeptical 
regarding the saws used, to bring 
their own saws’ which he will be 
pleased to use. 

The four other acts on the vaude- 
ville bill provide some splendid en- 
tertainment along the usual lines. 
“The Riverside Three” are three gift- 
ed singers, a triple alliance of melody 
and hilarity, as there is plenty of 
comedy in the offermg as weil as good 
music, 

“Business Is Business” is the title 
of a cha¥acter comedy one-act playlet 
to be presented by a company of tal- 
ented players, Hawley, Saxton and 
Company. 

LaRose and Adams offer a number 
of new song numbers and Alvia and 
Kenny will contribute “Fun on the 
Flving Rings.” 

Heading the screen attraction is the 


ever-popular Pearl White in her latest | 


screen success, “Any Wife.”

Live Decorously, 
Says Mary Carr 


Mary Carr, who has won fame by 
her heart-reaching depiction of moth- 


Firnest Golden is of high quality, and | er-love in the great Wiliam Fox pic- 
i ture, 


“Over the Ilijl.” indignantly 
repudiates the theory that actors for 
the silver screen are not, on the aver- 
age, a law-abiding, respectable, hard- 
working, home-loving lot of people, as 
simple and Kindly in their tastes and 
attitudes as the people in every other 
profession. Mrs. Carr says: 

“The trouble with people who judge 
is their unfair tendency to generalize 
—as Aristotle, the master logician 
would say. exercise the fallacy of hasty 
seneralization in reasoning. All film 
people should not be condemned be- 
cause a certain group of shem, who 
fortunately are in the minority, live 
as no decent people could live. A cer- 
tain number of people will always be 
found in every trade and profession 
whose actions bring discredit to the 
profession itself. 

“If every person who hears of sen- 
sational happenings in any profession 
would but stop and reason that there 
are thousands upon thousands of 
people in that profession-about whom 
one never hears, because they do 
nothing but live decorous lives, it 
would be a more tolerant, better bal- 
anced and happier world.”

Unusual Drama Is 
“Courage,” Coming to 
Criterion Monday 


Sidney Franklin's latest special film 
production, “Courage,” which has 
been for many months in the makiug, 
with an exceptionaily noteworthy cast, 
will be the screen offering at the Cri- 
ter.on theater this week. 

Naomi Childers, an actress of rare 
beauty and talent, has the leading 
feminine role, and Sam de Grasse, 
equally well known on the screen, 
has the male lead. 

Others appearing in this First Na- 
tional attraction are Lionel Belmore, 
Adolph Menjou, Lloyd Whitlock, Alec 
B. Francis, Ray Howard, Gloria 
Hope and Charles Hill Mailes, 

“Courage” was adapted for the 
screen by Sada Cowan, from Andrew 
Soutar’s novel of the same name. It 
is a gripping: story of a young Eng- 
lish engineer, Stephan Blackmoore, 
who is imprisoned for a murder he did 
not commit. From behind his prison 
bars he secretly directs a great. indus- 
try through his faithful and plucky 
little wife. By this means they help 
their government win a war. 

The real slayer, dying on the ‘at- 
tlefields, makes a confession exonerat- 
ing Blackmoore. As a result, Black- 
moore is not only reunited with his 
wife, but the romance of their son is 
turned from one of sorrow to one of 
ha~“iness. 


Pearl White Is 
Seen on Screen 
In Superb Gowns 


Pearl White, the famous star of 
William Fox photoplays, spent sev- 
eral weeks im Paris during her vaca- 
tion in Europe last summer. When 
she returned she brought with her 
a number of superb gowns fashioned 
by the celebrated makers, Paquin and 
Poiret. These gowns were creations 
made in advance of the season—fore- 
shadowing what later were to be 
placed on the market. 


Two of these gowns—one of them, 


for evening toilet—are worn by Mi 
White in “Any Wife,” her latest Fox | 
picture. The evening gown of black, 
with an abundance of lace and bead 
ornamentation, is sufficiently striking 
to arrest the admiration of any spec- 
tator, man or woman—but especially 
woman. 

“Any Wife” is an intensely dra- 
matic photoplay, having 1s its basis 
the perils attending a fortnuate wom- 
an's unfortunate prone to discon- 
tent with her lét as lacking in ex- 
citement and social gaiety. 


No sooner had William Farnum ar- 
rived in New York from Europe and 
adjusted his private affairs than he 
proceeded to the Fox studio and an- 
nounced he was ready for. work. Her- 
bert Brenon, as director, handed a

Coming in Person 


ToAtlanta Theater 


At the Atlanta theafer for three 
nights and matinee, starting Monday, 
January 9, Miss Madge Kennedy, fa- 
mous alike on stage and screen, will 
play in the comedy-drama, “Cornered,” 
which Henry W. Savage will present 
with the same cast and production 
that enjoyed a six months’ run at the 


Astor theater; New York, last sea- 
son. “ “Cornered” provides Miss Ken- 
nedy with a dual role that brings out 
her deeper talents as an emotional 
and dramatic actress. However, she 
loses no opportunity in the lighter 
scene of “Cornered” to display the 
refreshing gift of comedy that has 
been so largely responsible for her 
undeniable popularity. “Cornered” is 
a puzzlé play with a baffling plot 
and tense situations which are re- 
lieved at the psychological moment by 
the high light of laughter. William 
Archer, the noted English critic, pro- 
nounced the plot one of the most in- 
genious ever written. The story opens 
in a Chinese “pleasure palace’ in 
the Bowery district of New York.

and Mary is amazed at the resem- 
bhlance between herself and Margaret 
Waring. Intense dramatic situations 
are encountered, bewildering mysti- 
fication ensue, but just when the mys- 
tery and drama is most taut, re- 
mance and comedy enter to relieve 
and lighten. Miss Kennedy's legion 
of film admirers who followed and 
applauded her work on the silver sheet 
will be interested to know that out 
of the hundreds of plays she read 
in anticipation of her return to the 
stage “Cornered” was the one that 
appealed to her as an ideal vehicle in 
which to make her triumphant debut.

May Melville and George Rule are 
the featured headliners at Keith's 
Lyric Monday, Tuesday and Wednes- 
day. When the confirmed theater- 
goer sees that announcement he is 
sure to exclaim'“I remember them.” 
That is why such acts are called 
“Name” acts. They have by sincere 
effort and genuine ability establish- 
ed their names firmly in the memory 
of everyone. One may not beable 
just the style ‘of work they do, or 
how they wear their hair, but the 
name is firmly anchored in the mind 


and it’s the personality and ability 
behind the name that does it. These 
two well-beloved performers will be 
seen in their latest - vehicle, “The 
League of Servants.” 

Lou Miller and Alice Bradford is

Pearl White Coming 
To Grand Monday In 
Her Latest Picture 


The penalty which follows surren- 
der, by a well-loved wife, to an un- 
warranted discontent with her lot’ as 
lacking in excitement, is eloquently 
set .orth in “Any Wife,” a William 
Fox picture. in which the popular 
Pearl White will geome to Loew's 
Grand theater on Monday, Tuesday 
and Wednesday. The moral of the 
story, froin the pen vf Julia Tolsva, is 
obvious; but the incidents attending 
its development are described as in- 
tensely dramatic, and its conclusion 
—a happy one, by the way—involves 
not only a genuine surprise,: but clever 
comedy. 

In the earlier scenes Miss White 
appears in a couple of gowns which 
are “stunning;” and any one who 
has seen her richly dressed on the 
screen knows that she sets off such 
attire superbly. 

‘The supporting company contains 
several actors well and favorably 
known. The picture was directed by 
a man who has achieved an enviable 
reputation—Herbert Brenon.

-AT METROPOLITAN 


John Barrymore, in “The 
Lotus Eater,” Featured 
on Screen. 


Earl Fuller and his famous New 
York orchestra will be the special at- 
traction at the Metropolitan theater 
all this week. The announcement is | 
one of peculiar interest in view of | 
Mr. Fuller’s enormous following in 
Atlanta. For six years when the fa- 


Bi 


w 


mous Rector’s was at its prime Ear! 
Fuller was the chief attraction and | 
gained fame as a trap drummer sec: | 
ond to no man in the world, He has 
grown steadily in popularity, and 
since he began a tour of ‘the United 


States with his ten men in popular 
numbers and sublimated jazz his rec- 
ord has been an unbroken series of 
successes. Mr. Fuller’s company in- 
cludes Morva Williams, prima donna 
soprano, who co-starred with Eddie 
Foy in “The Orchids,” and appeared 
wi DeWolf Hopper in the “Mid- 
night Frolic.’ 

The Metropolitan’s feature picture 
for the week, “The Lotus Eater,” is 
one of conspicuous excellence. John 
Barrymore is the star; Marshall Nei- 
lan the producer. In the supporting 
cast are Anna Q. Nilsson, Wesley 
Barry, Colleen Moore, J. Barney Sher- 
ry, Frank Currier and others recog- 
nized by every follower of the screen. 
The story is by Albert Payson Ter- 
hune. The theme is far out of the 
ordinary. It shows in vivid contrast 
the superficial life of the effete east 
and the idealistic existence in the 
land of the lotus eaters, a little island 
in the tropies where a group of ship- 
wrecked victims form an idyllic colo- 
ny and foster the finest principles 
man has evolved. . 

John Barrymore plays the role of 
the youth who, by will of his embit- 
tered father, grows to manhood with- 
out having met any woman. At the 
age of twenty-five, when he is given 
freedom to cultivate the acquain- 
tance of New York’s four hundred, 
he meets a typical social aspirant 
with yearnings for money, and he 
falle an easy victim to her wiles. 
Ilow he regains his equilibrium and 
finds true values among the happy 
colonists on the tropical islands makes 
a fascinating story. 

The comedy for the week will be 
an Educational-Mermaid. ‘““The Ad- 
viser,” with Lloyd Hamilton in the 
leading role. Kinograms will open 
the bill. 

Farl Fuller and his orchestra will 
appear at four performances daily— 
2:15. 4, 7:30 and 9:15. While Mr. 
Fuller wields the baton most of the 
time, he has promised to. take his 
place at the trap drums and give an 
exhibition of the fine art that made 
hima famous. 


Paul Powell will direct Dorothy 
Dalion in “Theron of Lost Valley,” 
her next star picture, work on which 
will begin soon as Mr. Powell fin- 
ishes cutting his latest picture, “For 
‘the Defense,” starring Ethel Clayton. 
Miss Dalton has just finished work 
in “Moran of the Ladv J.etty.” Georce 
Melford’s production of Frank Norris’ 
story in which Rudolph Valentino has 
the leading male role. 


Corinne Griffith is in Florida, look- 
ing over special locations for her next 
picture. Miss Griffith will leave for 
Ifayana, Cuba. from where, after a 
rest of a few davs, she wil return to 
the Florida locations to start actual 
work, under the direction of Webster 
Campbell.

RACING PICTURE 


FEATURED AT RIALTO 


Thrilling Horse Race Fur- 
nishes the Big Scene in 


“Thunderclap.” 


we 


‘They’re off!” 

The shout goes up from thousands 
of throats and then—a hush, almost 
a painful silence. 

As the ali-apvsorbing moving pic- 
ture—a riot of color and fast-flying 
heels—rounds the first turn, field 
glasses and binocuiars are adjusted 
and, mental notes taken of the. re- 
spective positions of the fliers. 

Down the back stretch they fly, 
now this one and now that qne set- 
ting the pace. Into the back they go, 
each rider and horse seemingly with 
the understanding that the supreme 
effort awaits them just ahead. Around 
the back.turn they come, heading into 
the home stretch for the final spurt. 
But never a word from that vast 
throng. 


Every eye is glued to that fast ap-. 


proaching group of horse flesh and 
gay color. Every heart pulsates with 
the rapidity of a trip-hammer. As 
they near the wire, there is audible 
and muffled utterance, “Come on boy” 
or the groan of “Not a chance.” 

Like a flash from the sun through 
a rift in the clouds, they are: under 
the wire and then, only then, does 
the vast throng give vent to its pent- 
up feelings. With a mighty roar the 
crowd cuts loose, bedlam continuing 
as the prancing winner returns to 
the stand to again weigh-in. Then. 
a rus. to the. betting ring and—an- 
other race. 

“But the big race, the handicap 


takes place in “Thunderclap,” the re- 
markable Williamf Fox special, open- 
ing at the Rialto theater Monday. It 
is one of those gripping, stirring, ex- 
citing, nerve-racking incidents which 
has all the thrills of a genuine Derby 
day—all but one—the expense. The 
gay throng is there, flags are flying 
and the ver) atmosphere tingles with 
excitement. 

In the parade by the judges’ stand, 
the keen-eyed motion picture devotee 
is subconsciously drawn to entry No. 
6. There is something exceptionally 
attractive about the arch-necked, 
sleek-coated high stepper. Then, too, 
the confident demeanor of the gaily 
satined jockey. No. 6 is “Thunder- 
clap,” about whom the wonderful and 
fascinating masterpiece has been writ- 
ten. 

And yet, even in addition to this 


remarkable story of the sport of kings 
there is a pleasing story replete with 
excitement and thrills. There is a 
battle between youth and intrigue, a 
thrilling scene depicting the blowing 
up of a bridge and a love story _cer- 
tain to “get beneath the skin.” In a 
word, “Thunderclap” is a remarkable 
composite of thrills, smiles and satis- 
faction. | 


John McGraw, manager of New 
York Giants, paid his first visit to Vv

Twelve Stellar Players Are

Twelve stellar players and a sup-

that’s the record set by Cecil B. De- 
Mille’s latest Paramount masterpiece, 
“The Affairs of Anatgj,” which will 
be shown at the Strand theater all

dom’s who’s who. The phrase, “all-

it adequately describes a cast that in- 


cludes Wallace Reid, famous Para- |’ 


mount star; Gloria Swanson, Diliott 
Dexter, Bebe Daniels, Monte Blue, 
Wanda Hawley, Theodore Roberts, 
Agnes Ayres, Theodore Kosloff, Polly 
Moran, Raymond Hatton and Julia 


aye, 
Nothing like this cast in the way 
of aggregate talent has ever been ds- 
sembled before. The drawing power 
of almost any of the names on the 
roll has been sufficient to awaken the 
interest of the discriminating public. 
Here for the first time they are ap- 
pearing in a single production under 
the direction of a master producer— 
Cecil B. DeMille. 
' “The Affairs of Anatol” was writ- 
ten by Jeanie Macpherson, author of 
many notable Cecil B. DeMille pro- 
ductions.. Her story was suggested by 
Arthur Schnitzler’s scintillating com- 
edy of the same name, 

he same quality that is featured 
in the cast of principals and in the 
authorship has been carried through 
every phrase of production work. The 
supporting cast includes such ¢gapable 
actors as Guy Oliver, Charles Ogle, 
Clarence Geldart, Maude Wayne, 
Ruth Miller, William Boyd, Lucien 
Littlefield and others. The beautiful 
setti are the work of Paul Iribe, 
famous French artist, designer and 
decorator.

WALLINGFORD STORY 
ON SCREEN AT TUDOR 


“Son of Wallingford” Pro- 
duced Under Personal Di- 
rection of Chesters. 


_ “The Son of Wallingford,” the Vita- 

graph special production which will 
b« shown at the Tudor theater this 
week, is the result of twenty years’ | 
work on the part of George Randolph 
Chester. Mr.’ Chester received ideal 
training for writing, in that he has 
spent about ten years of his life tramp- 
ing’ through the United "States. He 
visited nearly every village and town 
in the entire country and has often 
joined hobos in their camp for a 
night’s sleep. 

He was especially interested in 
criminology and through the kindness 
of several jail wardens has, at various 
times in his life, been given acess to 
penitentiaries. Here he was able to 
study the criminal at close range. He 
was born near the Ohio state peniten- 
tiary and lived there for several years. 
It was this institution that first in- 
terested him in the study of criminals 
and their characteristics, 

As soon as the Wallingford stories 
became popular, Mr. Chester began to 
consider the kind of son that: would 
be bo° to such a father. On the one 
hand he had J. Rurus, a man of great 
ability, yet crooked beyond redemp- 
tion. On the other hand he had the 
wife, Fanny, a kind hearted, upright 
woman, honest beyond the shadow of 
a doubt. .To these two was born a 
son and Mr. Chester considered the 
type he would be. 

Through the earlier series of Wal- 
lingford stories Mr. Chester planned 
this son, the youth with the lobeless 
ear, and watched him grow up, wait- 
ing for the day when the boy would 
he old enough to appear in a stofy 
of his own. Through all these years 
the author plannea@ to make this his 
masterpiece. All the previous Walling- 
ford stories were stepping stones for 
the big narrative, “The Son of Wal- 
lingford,” which was written in col- 
laboration with Lillian Chester. 

After completing the story, select- 
ing the cast und directing the pro- 
duction, Mr. Chester feels that his 
dream has been realized. He believes 
that “The Son of Wallingford” is 
the grentest work of literature he has 
produced. 


WANDA HAWLEY IS

Wanda Hawley and T. Roy Barnes

famous movie star and the end gin

RUDOLPH VALENTINO 


COMING TO HOWARD 


In “The Conquering Power,” 
Star Has Another Ex- 
cellent Picture. 


Rudolph Valentino, the dashing he- 
ry of the tremendously popular mo- 
‘ion picture. successes, “The Four 
liorsemen” ‘and “The -Shiek,” is the 
star of the Metro production, ‘The 
(‘onquering Power,” this week's at- 
‘raction for the Howard theater. There 
« no one of the hundreds of mag- 
stars of the screen with a 
sreater foliowing than this Golighttul 
vung actor. 

“Tne Conquering Power” is a Rex 
lugram production, and in it Mr. In- 
‘ram has had the assistance of ali 
_ (he, principals who aided him in mak- 
ing “Lhe Four Horsemen of the 
Apocalypse.” At its New York pre- 
mere, *“Lhe nquering Power’ was 
acclaimed with unstinted enthusiasm, 
ome reviewers asserting that it. even 
equalled “Lhe Four Horsemen.” 

At is an adaptation by June Mathis, 

’ Balzae’s novel, “Kugenic Grandet.” 
‘The scene is laid in a provincial city 
«t France, where the miserly old 
(jrandet hoards gold and lives in pov- 
erty with his daughter, Eugenie. A 
nephew, Charles, a young boulevar- 
dier from Paris, son of a bankrupt 
nicide, is thrown -upon the miser’s 
-harity—and is accordingly thrown 
out, Shipping to Martinique with lit- 
ile money, but with the treasured 
memory of Eugenie’s love. This is 
tue beginning of Balzac’s tremendous 
story of love and greed. , 

Rudolph Valentino is one of the 
most prominent of the new stars now 
in motion pictures. His superb work 
in two big praductions won friends 
who wlll be more than delighted with 
his work in this, his third big produc- 
tion. The part is ideal. The entire 
cast is of unusual prominence—Alice 
Terry, 
dous force in “The Four Horsemen,” 
ix the winsome daughter of the miser, 
and plays the opposite to the heroic 
Valentino. Ralph Lewis, famous in

“The Paletace.” 


Bustér Keaton’s latest two-reel 
comedy, “The Paleface,’ made under 
the Joseph M. Schenck banner, has 
been completed and will be ready for 
distribution in the near future. 
mirthquake carries out the Keaton 
idea of having each picture made in 
a different locale. 

This comedy, which unquestionably 
takes place with Buster's finest ef- 
torts, has to do with his trials and 
troubles with a tribe of Indians who 
are far from being quiet and peace- 
ful, as one might believe upon view- 
ing the noble ‘Redman as stamped 
upon.one side of our latest species 
of nickels. Throughout the film Bus- 
ter is in danger and only through his 
original resourcefulness does he escape 
from many perilous situations that 
abound with humor of the very high- 
est type.

A Journal of the Great War. By

@harles G. Dawes was known only in 
the great world of finance, especially 
in Chicago, but the experiences since 
1914 have placed hig name in the list 
of the great military leaders of the 
world war and in the work that is now 
being officially done in Washington 
for his fellow man, as director of the 
budget. 

In the preface, Mr. Dawes says that 

“we,of this generation, are too near 
the gredt war to write its history.”

of a man who dared to close the door | 


of a great banking house behind him | 


and leave for a southern city, where 
he was stationed as colonel of the 
17th engineers which trained in At- 
lanta and which went from here to 
France. He writes of his work in 
trying to supply the American expe- 
ditionary forces in France, and there 
are many personal incidents of his ex- 
periences that will interest the reader. 
From a historic standpoint, the jour- 
nal of General Dawes will not only 
prove interesting, but it will be ex- 
tremély valuable and should be in the 
library of every home, and “from the 
standpoint of human interest it is 
filled with pictures of the characters 
that went in and out of General 
Dawes’ office in Paris.”

SILHOUETTES OF MY CON- 
TEMPORARIES. 

The great and popular editor of The 
Outlook needs no introduction’ to 
American readers, for he has, been for 
thirty. years an outstanding figure in 
American literature. He is also as 
widely known in the Christian min- 
istry, for he is the popuiar successor 
to his friend ane associate Henry 
Ward Beecher as the pastor of Plym- 
outh ‘church in Brooklyn. He is also 
the author of many volumes dealing 
with Christianity in its relations to 
social problems, and with American | 
fetters. 

In this volume Dr. Abbott has writ- 


i ten a collection of intimate sketches— 
| not biographies—they 


are pen por- 
traits of men who Mr. Abbott has 
known and whose careers he has stud- 
ied—all of them leaders in their gen- 
eration. Among them being FP. T. 
Barnum, Edwin Booth, Abranam Lin- 
coln, Edward Everett Hale and Philip 
Brooks, and the most striking and 
lasting impressions of his eighty 
years’ association with great men are 
here given, 

When he introduced a department 
called “The Outlook” into the Chris- 


' tian union, it became his duty to make 


a first-hand study of the great char- 
acters of that day. 

The book will be very entertaining 
both to the old and the young, for 
it involves a study of the men who 
were making history, and the most 
interesting history is personality. 
(Doubleday, Page & Co., Garden City.) 


FACE TO FACE WITH GREAT 
MUSICIANS. 

Charles D. Isaacson, the well-known 
author of whom Frank La Force has 
written some interesting truths in 
his ifitroduetion, presents in twe 
groups (the first group having been 
published sometime ago) the real per- 
sonalities of men and women who have 
been geniuses in the world of music, 
and also gives his readers a clearer 
understanding of their works.

of as many successes and failures,

troduces a group of great composers

Words by Lewis Carroll and illustra-

This is one of the most attractive

the Christmas season. The illustra- 
tions are in color, and as all children 
know about Lewis a 8 “Alice in

attractive these illustrations are and 
how appropriate for the words and 
the music. (McMillan & Co., New

The Disobedient Kids. An interpre,

The work was entrusted to William 
H. Tolman, Pb.D., a social economist 
and publicist, whose war record is 
as well known by the men and wom- 
en in that country as this attractive 
collection of stories is by the children 
of that land. 

During the latter part of the war 
Mr. Tolman was regional director of 
the Foyer du Soldats in Bordeaux, 
and was responsible for one of the 
large depots for the Czecho-Slovaks 
in the south of France. He was se- 
lected to promote a better understand-

dence in Prague. He has been award-

book which is full of pictures, eight 
of them in color by Scheiner, an 
academician of Prague. who has “em- 
broidered the text with a charm and 
a fantasy, so delicate, that they can 
not fail to deepen the impression of 
the story. (The book can be bought

Harry Beaumont, who has just com-

confidently of his hunting prowess be- 
fore he left and Miss Dana said: 

“I want to count your bag, not 
hear about it. Remember, ‘Seeing's 
Believing.’ ” 


Alice Terry has purchased a new 
coupe, which she is learning to drive 
about Hollywood, when she is not at 
Metro studios preparing for the new 
Ingram production, “The Prisoner gf

Vitalizer Found in Africa Produces 
Results in a Few Days—Better F 
Than Gland Treatments. 


The most. amazing vitalizer known today 
has been discovered in the bark of an Afri- 
can tree. An extract made from this bark, 
and compounded in tablet form with other 
invigorators of proved merit, is declared 
to be far superior to even the famous ‘‘goat 
giand’’ and ‘‘monkey gland’’ treatments. In 
most cases, it produces gratifying results in 
just a few days, and as the treatment is 
continued the vitality increases rapidly, the 
circulation improves and the glow of health 
is felt.in every part, 

If you have lost your youth, vigor and 
‘“‘pep’’ you need not worry. No matter what 
els@ you have tried without benefit, science 
declares flatly that you willik get from this 
new extract the results you desire. In fact, 
the laboratories making the tablets for the 
American trade guarantee to refund the 
purchase price to anybody who reports ‘‘no 
benefit’’ affer only ore week's treatment.

“Parody Outline of History.” a volume 
that, chameleon-like, varies in excel-

of Ring Lardnér and James Branch 
Cabell are delightful, the parody of 
Mr. Sinclair Lewis is as dull as the 
works of Mr. 
Mr. Scott Fitzgerald is’ almost as 
vulgar as Mr. Fitzgerald’s own book. 
But there is one exception—Professor 
William Lyon Phelps, which i. as 
diverting as Professor Phelps is in the 
flesh, instead of being as unimportant 
as he is on paper. And there is the 
great Grroce’s “On History,” now done 
into English—it’s just that—by 
Douglas Ainslie. 
Fiction of The Year. 


So much for mere facts; one may 
now proceed to the more intriguing 
path of fiction, as made _ manifest 
during the year in the drama, the 
novel, and even in verse. But some- 
thing more. than halfway between 
these two extremes are Mr. Christo- 
pher Morley, Mr. Robert Benchley,. 
Mr. Don Marquis, and Mr. Howard 
Broun—more or less literary journal- 
ists, who delight large and devoted 
publics in The Evening Post, Life, The 
Sun and the World. “Carter.” the 
new Don .Marquis collection, contains 
obvious memories of his days on un 
Atlanta newspaper; Mr. Benchley and 
Mr. Broun—Mr. Broun achieves ad- 
mirers of the most bellicose loyalty— 
are, to the best of my knowledge and 
belief, appearing between coveres for 
the first time; Mr. Morley appears 


igreat delight of Kenelm Digby's fol- 


| lowers. 


The choisest thing, however, 


\in “Plum Pudding” is the dedication 


—to The Three Hours for Lunch 
club, elysian title... Across the water, 
the renaissance of Max Beerbohm, the 
eternal darling of the gently cynical 
and at least mildly sophisticated, is 
the only rival to Mr. A. A. Milne’s 
newer vouge. And Mr. Milne, of 
course, is the author of “Mr. Pim 
Passes By,” and one of the new dra- 
matists of last year. The dramatic 
sensation of the year, though, both 
on top of the stage and on the print- 
ed page,’ was “Liliom”’—here again, 
it is hard to imagine even Mr. Belasco, 
or Mr. Avery Hopwood raising a dis- 
senting voice. Molnar has long been 
known to fame as the author of “The 
Devil,” but this is a new kind of 
fame; and Miss Clemence Dane has 
long been known to fame among con- 
noisseurs of English fiction as the 
author of “A Regiment of Women” 
and “Legend,” a sort’ of halfway 
house to drama. “A Bill of Divorce- 
ment” is a bad second to “Liliom,” 
but. it surely is second:

Splendid Music 
On Victor List _ 
For New Month 


To play a melody through three 
times and each time to draw from 
it three, utterly variant emotional 
sensations—this is a feat reserved 
for Fritz Kreisler with which to en- 
trance 
The world is beginning to realize at 
last the full charm of the weirdly 
imaginative “Hymn to the Sun” 
(from “Le Coe D’Or”).

humorous, Luerezia Bori and Giu- 
seppe De Luca prove beyond a doubt 
on two Victor Red Seal records for 
January—‘‘Pronta io son” (My part 
I'D play) and “Vado Corro” (Haste 
we!) fr “Don Pasquale.” ° 

If all he world loves a lover, the 
whole world will rejoice in a new 
love song record by Beniamjno Gigli 
among the January Victrola records 
—“Tu Sola” (Thou alone!). 

Every violinist and every concert- 
goer knows Mendelssohn’s ‘“‘Concertu 
in E Minor—Finale.” ,It is a num- 
ber that calls for / extraordinary 
strength and nerve—im other words, 
such ability as that of Jascha Hei- 
fetz. Victor audiences in January 
will find this number played as few 
have ever heard it. | 

For January Victor records, Mine.

a prayer as a song, “Just for To-

The 


Spring isn’t really so far away, 
and during January Victor audiences 
will be charmed by Edward John- 
son’s new record, “Heart to Heart.” 

As a singer of love songs John’ 
McCormack needs no_ introduction. 
The very: fact that his new January 
Victor record -is a love song, “Rose 
of My Heart.” It is one of the fin- 
est love lyrics McCormack has ever 
sung. ‘ 

Leopold Stokowski’s own comments 
on the Philadelphia Orchestra’s selec- 
tion for a marvelous recital on the 
Victor January list are eminently 
suitable to introduce it. 
is Brahms’ Symphony No. 
Minor Movement (Poco Allegretto). 
This orchestra’s distinguished direc- 
tor says: “Bradhms—a giant in the 


mood of beautiful lyric song—simple, 
yet appealing directly to the heart. 
This movement’is one of the most ex- 
pressive of all these works, and holds 
a special place in the heart of every 
connoisseur of music.” 

Sergei Rachmaninoff playing a 
song by Kreisler is an _ interesting 
idea. This famous pianist’s beautiful 
arrangement of reisler’'s “Lieber- 
leid” -(Tove’s Sorrow) makes an 
equally interesting Victor record for 
January. 

One public speaker referred to 
Harry Lauder as a “great humanist.” 
A reporter got it “humorist” and a 
reader wrote to the speaker to com- 
plain. Yet both were right. and it 
is not as the humorist that Sir Harrv 
has made an annealing Victor record 
for January. “Marv of Argyle” and 
“Auld Scotch Songs” are sung in the 
colloquial Scotch fashion, which is 
the very essence of pathos. 

Lambert Murphy sings two fine 
songs for the January Victor records. 
“Drifting Along With the Tide” and 
“A Dream of Your Smile.” 

John Steel’s singing of “Say It 
With Music” will inerease its popu- 
laritv. “If You Only Knew” is a 
delichtful love song. 

Two ponnular tenors appearing on 
a single Victor recordin “Jannarv 
are William Robyn, singing “Mollv-O 
(I Tove You).” and Charles Harrison, 
in “Love's Ship.” 

Dealers in Victor-Victrola wrod- 
ucts are glad to play the new Victor 
offerings to all interested. 


colored population of the cify of At- 
lanta increased from 7,000 in 1920 
to 11,000 for 1921. ‘The greatest per- 
centage of increase was in the night 
schools, representing a large number 
of adult members of the negro group. 
This increase indicates a consuming 
desire on the part of the colored group 
to acquire an education. [t is ear- 
nestly hoped that each parent will see 
that his child reports to school Jan- 
vary 3. 1922, as it is hoped that ev- 
ery available seat will be occupied at 
every session. During the three weeks 
preceding the holidays there was a 
noticeable dropping off of students in 
the three upper grades in the public 
schools. The impression is abroad that 
these students dropped out to rum er- 
rands for the purpose of making some 
Christmas change. It is the hope of 
the public school officials that these 
absentees will no longer be noticeable 
in the ranks of the grades mentioned.

“Still, Mawruas, the moving picture 
manufacturer has: got to pay attention to 
‘his’ customers’ knvexs,; the came like any

the treaty ain't been ratified by 


the senate yet,’ Maerris Peraznutter said. - 


“That's only a matter of a few speeches 
by democratic semators, Mawruss, which 
shouldn’tought to.teke lenger as a couple 
of months or so,” Abe said, “and then the 
manufacture for export of imitation Gil- 
lette safety razors. and of Cameras that 
you couldn’t teil from a kodak expept By 
taking pictures with them will be resumed 
all over Germany, yanderstand, asd every- 
thing will go on the same like # was 
before the war.” 

“And I suppose oar poor sol- 
diers nebich will be erdered to 
come back from around Co- 
blenz,” Morris swggested. 3 

“I suppose so,” Abe replied. . 

“The:’re going t® be terrible 
home-sick for a few weeks after 
they get home,” Morris: re- 
mar..ecd, 

“They'll soon get used to liv- 
ing over here,” Abe said, “‘ai- 
though it will be @ big change 
to come back to America after 
having enjovei euch freedom 
living under marti@i law in Ger- 
many.” 

“Don't..you think, Abe,” Mor- 
ris asked, “that Mr Hryan could 
\strain a point am@ allow con- 
gress to™pass a law exempting 
returned Americar soldiers from 
all them prohibitten and anti- 
cigarette laws for anyhow six 
months, so that they could get 
accustomcd to livimg in @ free 
country after being pretty near 
three years in a @own-trodden 
place like Germany?” 

“Sooner or hater them retuara- 
ed American soldiers will have 
to get used to Siving in the 
United States the same like a 
German does in Carlsbad when 
h2 nas been put on a diet for 
combined heart ang kidney frou- 
ble, Mawruss,” Abe said, “and 
they might just so we] start in 
right now.” 

“] bet that after they get 
back, they’ll do nething but sit 
around their barracks and dis- 
cuss the chances of this here 
terrible peace beimg bronght to 
a close so that they can go over 
to a foreign coustry and live 
once more like free American 
sitzons used to tive back in 
1916,” Morris said. 


6< W KLL, maybe wher the 

: peace treaty is ratified 
and we start in te fix up a new 
commercial treaty with Ger- 
many, one of the clauses will 
allow the importation for me- 
dicina? purposes of several miliiom barrels 
Muncihener, Culmbacher and Wurzburger 
annualiy, Mawruss,” Abe said, “because 
now that congress has gone on a vacation 
without passing the anti-beer bill, Maw~ 
russ, there’s nothing to prevent a licensed 
dcetor from prescribing three steins every 
twenty minutes before and after eating, 
y understana.” 

“Sure I know,” Morris said, “but that 
ain’t going to last, Abe, beeause home 
brewing in this eountry is practically in 
its infancy and right now in Washington, 
where they are holding hearings on this 
here tariff bill, I bet ver the manufac- 
turers of yeast and malt extract, and the 
Hop Growers’. Association of North Amer- 
ica, to say nothing of patent bottle top 
makers, are appearing before tariff 
conmission and protesting against this 
country being floeded with Munchener for 
meditinal purpozes.” 

“It seems to me, Mawruss, that this 
here tariff commission fs going to treat 
a whole Jot of American industries like 
they would be in their infaney when as 
a matter of _act the patentees of the proc- 
esses which are now being used by the 
cor orations engaged in such infant in- 
dustries, died in workhouses and homes 
for the aged schon years ago already,’ 


Abe said. 
scX ELL, there’s enough industries 
VW which is really and truly in their 
infancy, Abe, and which could easy be 
run out of business by foreign competi- 
ticn,” Morris declared. “For instance, 
Abe,*there should ought to be a tariff on 
German moving picture fillums because 
after all, if the moving picture industry

the p.ctute business is the same 
like the hotel busimess and the theayter 
business; everybody thinks he could run 
such a business better than the man who 


‘is in it and trying to make a living by it. 


Also, Abé; people are knocking’ moving 
‘picture fillums which don’t knew the,first 
thing about how they showtild ought to be 
written.” | ~ 

“And thé same kind of people are writ- 
ing them, ioo,” ‘Abe said, “or, anyhow 
they are -writing a big majority of them, 
Mawruss, because ! don’t claim.-that all 
meving pictures is rotten, Mawruss. Some 
ef them is so good that it’s a wonder to

cen get-German fillums for a tenth the 
price.” 

“Maybe they get them for a tenth the 
price, and maybe they don’t,” Abe said, 
“but the audiences has got to pay the 
same memey to see German fillums as 
they de te see American fillums, Mawruss, 
and se far as | know, Mawruss, as there 
is nething im the treaty of peace which 


. compels an audience to go and see a Ger- 


man fillum, Mawruss, in preference tc 
an Amertcan fiillum, y’understand, and 
speaking a6 a member of an American 
audience which ain't exactly pro-German 
ner auything near it, y'understand, the 
reasen why German fillums crowd the 
theayters am@ American fillums don’t, un- 
derstand me, must be squything other- 
wise than just being at peace with Ger- 
many again. Im fact, Mawruss, it might 
even occur to American moving picture 
manufacturers that American fillums ain't 
as good as German fillums, and that there 
are other ways for a good American sitson 
to show how much he loves his country 
than spending his hard earned money to 
see American fillums which has the same 
effect on the audience as te grains of 
veronal, y’understand.” 

“Migkt you got tired of pictures be-

mcrris suggested. 


na renters I did,” Abe admitted, “but 
at the same time, Mawruss, for a 
night school gradgawate, y' understand, 
I’ve read a whole lot of books, and after 
having read chotzig over a hundred books, 
y’understand, fn reading the hundred and 
first. Mawruss, I still couldn’t tell after 
the first ten minutes how ‘tthe book is 
going to end. Also, Mawruss, when you

“Sure I know,” Abe agreed, “but from. 
the prices these here moving picture cor- 
porations has been paying, Mawruss, they 
should ought to be able te hire a frst- 
class A number one designer, with ideas 
of his own, y’understand, se that au- 
diences could be guarantee@ that the pic- 
ture they are seeing woulda’t be duplil-

“ the trouble with moving 
picture manufacturers is that so 
many of them used to be engaged im busi- 
nesses where if they turned ewt a preduct 
which a whole lot of custemers tiked when

ie a tremendous hit all over the country, 
and right away the manufacturer follows 
it up with a fillum which is the same or 
nearly the same by the name Fermenta- 
tion, y’understand, even though every- 
body was Crazy about Inflammation, do 
they say to their friends: ‘Ycu should 
ought to go and see Fermentatiun at the 
Palast theayter this week. It’s just like 
Inflammation?” No, sir, they don’t say 
nothing of the kind. What they says is: 
‘I nere’s a fillum by the name Fermenta- 
tion over to the Palast theayter this week, 
and it’s a dead ringer for Inflammation. 
Don’t go near it.’ And right away they 
start knocking the moving picture busi- 
ness and say that it’s terrible the way 
picture is being duplicated by moving pic- 
ture manufacturers.” 


me why the fellers who write them ain't 

offered big salaries by moving picture 

manufacturers to learn the other writers 
a 


how to write.” 


ag | ee anyhow, Abe,” Morris __ said, 
“there’s one big disadvantage which 


the Germans has got that will always 


stop them from turning out moving pic- 


tures the way they make them in Cali- 
fornia. The Germans ain't got the wonder- 
ful California climate where they could 


photograph by sunlight practically every 
day, and they ain’t got the Calitornia scen- 


ery and the pallum trees and flowers.” 
“Maybe that ain't such a big disadvan- 


. tage as it looks, Mawruss,” Abe remarked, 


“whicn if they would have mountains sev- 


eral thousand feet high and canyons sev- 


eral thousand feet deep right in the city 
limits of Berlin, imstead of in the city 
limits of Los Angeles, Mawruss, it’s pos- 
sible that them German fillum writers 
would loaf on the job, and instead of 
working overtime to get a lot of excite- 
ment into their fillums, thcy would have 
a desperado by the name Fritz von Wesen- 
donck-Schmalfeld being chased over the 
same old mountains and through the same 
old canyons which hundreds of other des- 
peradoes gets chased over and through 
in moving picture after moving picture, 
Mawruss, unti! «oving picture audiences 
north of 125th street ure just so familiar 
with the suburbs of Los Angeles as they 
are with Bronnix Park, y’understand.” 


“Well, there’s one thing you must got 
to admit, Abe,” Morris said. ‘ There’s been 
a wonderful improvement in the way mov- 
ing pictures have been photographed ia 
the last few years.” ,

| ANHAM, the owner of the Broken 
Trigger, sat by the lamp on the 
big table, sewing. It was an in- 
congruous business, for Lanham 
was tall and large handed and 
the thing he was bent upon so 
seriously was repairing a ridicu- 
ously little pair of overalls. 


His foreman leaned® over the back of 
a tilted chair watching the operation in- 
terestedly. Across the big knee was spread 
the seat of the diminutive garment, scar- 
red with a three-cornerea tear which had 
been raised into hard welts by overhand 
strokes with saddle thread, pulled tight. 

“You’ah young offspring’s goin’ to fee! 
like he’s settin’ on a rawhide rope,” the 
foreman suggested. “Let me take ’em 
down to the blacksmith snop an’ flatten 
them seams some on the anvil.” - 


A jerk of the thread loosened an ava- 
lanche of assorted stuff from the small 
pocket into Lanham’s lap. Curiously he 
fingered the collection and spread the ex- 
hibits upon his broad palm. There was 
a little wad of red wool yarn, the wheel 
from a broken spur, the dried head of a 
horned toad, a Mex silver dollar, and a 
cut-glass stopper from a bottle. 


Lanham’s interest centered upon the 
stopper. He held it up in the light. “lI 
wondered what had become of that,” he 
said quietly. “It was hers, you know.” 
There was a peculiar gentle emphasis in 
the way he said “hers.” “Belongs to a bot- 
tle ‘that always stood on her bureau. It 
held lilac water.” 

His big hand closed tightly upon the 
boy’s treasure. The foreman lowered his 
eyes and stared at his boots. 

“Little. Don probably hooks her mem- 
ory up pretty close to that bottle, like a 
pup holding a scent. She used to let him 
wet his nose with the stopper.” 

_He restored the stuff to the boy’: 
pocket when his sewing was finished, and. 
taking the lamp with him, went off to his 
bedroom. Standing over the cot in a cor- 
ner across from his own bed, the father 
lowered the lamp beside the — sleeping 
boy’s face. An anxious frown c’ouded the 
little lad’s expression, as though he were 


r 


wondered what to do with the man. 


Lot restiag peacefully, Lanham crouched 
dowrm upon his heels and softly touched 
the small hand flung limply across the 
bianket. At once the hand tightened upon 
his finger, the child’s frown gave way, to 
the relaxation of happy surprise and the 
smiling lips drowsily whispered, “Muvvy!”’ 


WO years of solely masculine attention 

had molded domestic matters at the 
ranch crudely awry. Lanham noted that 
the little hand about his finzer was grimy 
in its creases, that the corners of the boy’s 
mouth were caked with aried syrup, that 
the tucking of. the bed cvuvers was bunchy 
and haphazard. The whole room had an 
air of dispirited unwelcome. Lanham’s 
steady gray eyes roved over the desolate, 
silent place. They came to rest again, 
tenderly, upon the boy’s face. He gripped 
the small hand softly and rose.to pre- 
pare for sleep. 

The regular ranch routine went on 
with unchanging demands upon the fa- 
ther’s attention and witn unreHeved mo- 
notony for the boy until, early in Decem- 
ber, a sudden impulse seized upan the 
Cow hands to “make a Christmas fir the 
kid.” It caught them collectively, like a 
spreading epidemic, and a stir of stalking 
mystery enveloped the outfit. 

Eventually, one by one, they sent away 
letters with enclosures of money as each 
narrowed a list of tentative selections to 
his final choice of a gift pre-eminent— 
and each with an enlarged air of elation. 
Then, as certain notices began to arrive 
in the mails, they stole away one by one 
to the express agent at the railroad, a 
half-day’s ride out, and rode in‘after dark, 
each craftily hiding a package in a place 
of inviolate sec!usion. 

Christmas does not come to the high, 
horizon-wide mesas of Arizona—it has to 
be ‘intrigued. Three days before Christ- 
mas little Andy Ames, the runt of the out- 
fit, rode away toward the mountains, an 
unladen® packhorse trailing behind him. 
He returned after dark on Christmas eve 
to find that his bunkmates had plucked 
the cotton stuffing of his quilt all into 
little pieces to make snow for the tree 
hée- was bringing back. 


After the boy had been herded to bed 
and the tree had been set up and dressed, 
the men disappeared in a body, only to 
return, one at a time, with cautious back- 
ward glances and hoarse whispers. Each 
slipped a package from under his coat and 
passed it to Lanham in suppressed ex: 
citement. They gave their varied instruc 
tions: 

“Open her up, Clint, an’ stack her un- 
der the tree for His Nibs.” 

“Peel her down, Chief. an’ set her 
where the light will hit her good.” 


remained fixed in fishlike 


“Be sure an’ tell him this here’s from 
me.”’ 


HE instructions diifered, though all 
bore the same note of unconcealed 
pride; but the packages were strangely 
alike in shape And size and weight. Hight 
of them lay in a row, and Lanhafn curi- 
ously tore open the ends of the wrappings, 
one after another, and peeked in. 
Before going to bed he dug out a pack- 
age of his own, tossed it on the table, and 
stared at it in helpless perplexity. It va- 
ried from the eight others in no particu- 
lar of shape, size or weight. He held it 
in his hands for a moment, thinking; then 
he cast it indifferently into the cobweb- 
bed space behind the wood box and cross- 
ed softly to the doorway of the bedroom. 


In the morning, when word came to 
che bunkhouse that little Don was finish- 
ing his breakfast and that the big moment 
of showing him the tree was at hand, the 
punchers soft-footed through the kitchen 
and dining room to the closed door of the 
big room. There, by kneeling, crouching, 
leaning and tip-toeing they contrived to 
allign their eight heads vertically with the 
door frame, and at the sound of Lanham’s 
voice calling to Don they openea the door 
a-crack. 

Slowly the expectant grins on the 
brown faces slackened and hung loosely 
like slits in mail pouches. Their eyes, 
glinting in the candlelight, widened and 
stares. For 
there, ranged under the tree like a*rack 
in an armory, stood eight small rifles— 
eight little .22 Winchesters, as alike as 
gauge tests could make them. 

The boy came in with Lanham’s hand 
about his shoulder. For a long moment his 
gaze took in the lighted tree with its bar- 
baric adornments. The surprise was com- 
plete, but mystification wag his outstand- 
ing emotion. And then his eyes dropped 
to the array of small arms. 

The spread of gifts began and ended 
with riflé. There was naught beside. ‘The 
effort to play up to his big father’s expec- 
tations was manly and firm, but no word 
nor action came to allay the rising lump 
in his throat. In the end the child in him 
won over the insecure groundings of man- 
hood. His arms went about the long leg 
at his side. His face dropped against Lan- 
ham’s hip, and the stroking touch upon 
his shoulder loosed a desolate sob from 
his quivering lips. 

In the big room, with their backs to 
the tree, Lanham and little Don sat en- 
tangled together in a great leather chair. 
The lingering last shudders of long sob- 
bing were still shaking the little fram-¢ 
encircled in Lanham’s arm. 

“What did you want? What would you 
like, my old son?” he asked gently.

Futilely he 


“I don’t know, I d- -don’t know what,” 
“Only—-something!”’ 


ATE one evening of the following 

spring, when the checking over of the 
herds had been completed and the range 
was promising fair, Lanham _ sauntered 
over to his foreman’s small cabin and 
asked him to step outside a minute. 

“I want to speak of something I’ve been 
thinking about since last Christmas,” he 
said, and seemed to be choosing a begin- 
ning with especial care. “About my boy,” 
he added. 
paper in regardful silence. 

“I find the little fellow is not part of 
us here. He is lonely, Lee—damned lone- 
ly. He does not stiffen to the life on the 
ranch. He needs something to direct his 
interests—or rather some one to direct 
them; and pretty soon he will need book 
schooling.” Another silence followed, and 
the foreman rolled and rerolled. the to- 
bacco of his cigarette. 

“If we were to have a woman here— 
Lanham continued, and halted, “the right 
kind of a woman—some one to take the 
place of the mother that left him—” His 
fingers slowly combed through the tan- 
gled mane of the big roan, and he aban- 
doned this beginning as too Involvea. 


“What I’ve had in mind,” he continued 
presently, “is some one young enough to 
be understanding and companionable to 
him—some one interested enough to love 
him—some one nice in the ways that this 
outfit lacks. But there’s an obvious dif- 
ficulty.”’ 3 

The foreman ground the glowing end 
of his match into the gate rail and re- 
flectively exhaled a thin drift of smcxe. 

“If there were another way to secure 
the right person for the boy I would 
choose it in preference,” Lanham stated 
after several minutes, and his voice came 
strangely devoid of its usual gentle modu- 
lation. “As it stands, I am going to ask 
a young woman to marry me.” 

To the foreman, who knew the fee'ing 
with which Lanham held to certain mem- 
ories, the announcement struck with an 
almost physical impact. 

“There is only one woman I can think 
of—and why I should think of her I do not 
know. I met her only once, and talied 
with her less than ten minutes. Why | 
think any fine woman might consider the 
proposal [ have to make is beyond under- 
standing—a proposal of marriage with the 
factor of love deliberately crossed out?” 
But I believe this woman might. in all sin- 
cerity. I am going twenty-two hundred 
miles to find out. I'll think it over a bit 
yet.” And he walked slowly away toward 
the house. 

He did think it over for several days

\]¥B-HAD met-her in. the offices of a <> 


Miss Maitland stood beside her 
desk removing her gleves. Lanham had 
been watching distantly the entrance of 
the building, and had followed her up ia 
the next elevator. . ” , 7 

“Sir. Lanham!” the girl cried out soft- 
ly in pleasurable. surprise as the big fei- 
low stepped toward her hesitantly. She 
gav2 tim her hand impulsively, as to an 
old friend that had returmed. In her eyes 
a a lock as thoueh she were seeing 
“Arizona.” 


“We were not expecting you. Mr. Bar- 


clay nas not come down yet.” 

“Ll will see him later,” Lanham replied. 
“I cawée this morning, Miss Maitland, to 
see you-—to ask if I might see you alone, 
later. Possibly this evening, when the of- 
fice closes?” - 

“I should like te impose one con@ition,” 
she replied with an engaging note of cha)- 
lenge in her voice, “that you talk to me 
again about the west.” 

It was arranged that he should call for 
her at five o'clock. He came a little early 
and talked with Barclay, but left when 
she was ready, and they went uptewn 
on top of‘a Fifth avenue bes. As they 
rode above the crowds and the traffic the 
girl kept up a running fire of gay, satirical 
comment on people and the phases of city 

“yife about them which she felt must strike 
him humorously. Lanham found himself 
being genuinely entertained. 

At Fifty-ninth street they left the bus 
and walked through the park, up and 
across the street of the girl's little 
apartment. Lanham talked of roundu, days 
on the range, of the country where his 
ranch lay on the Broken Trigger, and of 
how to roast wild turkey over an open 
fire. Responsive to the girl’s eager in- 
terest, he talked well and found many 
half-forgetten things of unexpected inter- 
est to himself. “But of the thing he had 
come to speak to her about he could rot 
talk at all; and the girl knew that some- 
thing had slipped. She wondered if her 
manner had been too social to impress 
him favorabiy es one suited for secre- 
tarial duties. oi 

Upon leaving her at the steps of-the 
apariment Lanham managed a.vague be- 
ginning. 

“My little boy is with me. He is more 
loncly than any boy shouid be. I should 
like mighty well to. have you Know him, 
if-you could—that is, if you wou'd care—” 

And now the girl understood it all, 
she thought. Busy man—-in town for few 
days-—no friends—week-end coming, and 
boy on his hands. But why this seeking 
of a private interview and this elaborate 
leading up to so simple a request? 

“Tomorrow is Saturday,” she answered 
interestediy: “let me have him for the 
Aftcrnoou. We can go to see the animals 
at Bronx park and have no end of a good 
tim.” 

“That's good of you,” Lanham said, 
grasping her hand, and again there was 
that peculiar earnestness in his manner 
as lhe added. “I hope you will find him 
likable and—good company.” : 


4E next evening Lanham waited for 

them at the subway station. They 
raced down the platform toward him with 
a burst of happy langhter. Helen Mait- 
land’s eyes were bright: “Adorable!” she 
breathed in a whisper, with a nod toward 
the small head hugged under her arm. 
And then, aloud, “We're going back to- 
morrow to finish up.” 

At their meeting to start the exped!- 
tion the following day Lanham asked to 
join them. At the zoo he loaded Don with 
peanuts and turned him loose upon the 
monkeys, taking the girl to himself. A 
sudden panit had seized him, to have the 
affair over with as quickly as possible; 
either to declare himself fairly and square- 
ly before this unsuspecting young crea- 
tur2 and to face hor probable amazement, 
or to abandon the idea forthwith. He had 
decided, abruptly, to see it through. 

Leading her to a bench in the open, 
whero the least attention would be at- 
tracted, he leaned forward with his el- 
bows on his knees and waited before 

peaking until 2 jumpy pulse beat in his 
throat subsided. 

“in tho west, Miss Meitland, a man 
gets into a way of ‘reading sign, as it is 
calied out there, wherever he goes. His 
welfare. sometimes his life, depends upon 
his abiity to see and remember little 
thiars he runs across on a trail. The 
depth of a hoof print, the way a twig has 
been bent, the look in a man’s eye—any- 
thine muy be sign to him and tell him 
things he needs to know. From sign he 
comes to pretty definite conclusions about 
things he can’t see around the bend. Some- 
times he’s put where he will stake a good 
deal on his judgment, and take a lot of 

sponsibility.” 

Lanham raised his eyes. from the walk 
and gazed off vaguely beyond the distant 
groups of holiday folk.

in amazement; but she-was net bewilder- 
ed by the proposal so much as struck by 
a startling remembrance. She recalled 
thinking on the day when Lanham sat 
dictating by hér desk, “What eyes to be 
trusted!” And as he turned away te leave 
her, “What a back to rest behind for 
shelter!” Here were the thoughts return- 


-ed in a proffered aetuality—thée call to 


trust—-the protection offered. She turned 
upon him a look of quiet wonder. 

“Forgive me, tf you can?” Lanham 
spoke quickly. “I intend only respect. In 
return for what I ask I am prepared to 
vive you all that I have left to give.” He 
then added gently: “That 
would mean everything but love. Please 
know | care enough for your feeling to 
spare you any iniplied efffontery of that 
sort, after a day and a half acquaintance.” 
. “Please don’t be so concerned over my 
feelings.” Her tone was without rebuke, 
and not at all ironic. “They are buried 
deep. You see, I have worked for years 
in an office, where men are habitually un- 
concerned. And besides, 
are staking your judgment on my uncer- 
standing.” 

Lanham smiled again. “Well, frankly,” 
he declared with an undefinable sense of 
relief, “I held a memory of you, and you 
seemed to characterize the sort of things 
I would like to have surrounding my boy. 
I eame directly to you in my trouble. 1 
thought of you here, alone, and not hap- 
py. You seemed not to have found the 
things you desired and, in a way, to be 
resigned to lesa. I found myself desolate, 
and Jeft with a problem that was beyond 
me. With difficulty and a sort of wbaifie- 
ment in both of our lives, it seemed as 
though possibly we—!” 

“So you suggest that. we pa#ol our mis- 
fortunes and work out a partnership of 
wretchedness! I’m not sure that I should 
enjoy that.” - 

“tT fear I put it badly.” 

“I think you put it gioomily. Now, as- 
suming you wish to induce me to come, 
why not offer the inducements instead of 
dispiriting me over the prospect?” 


| Rng looked up quickly. But there 
was no flippancy in the girl's quietly 
humorous gaze. After all, the suggestion 
was obviously logical; he was not pre- 
sumed to be making love to her. 

“TI really mean to offer all that I have 
to give,” he said. “You would be leaving 
every familiar association and giving yqur 
life’s happiness into our keeping. I would 
try to make it secure. Love you would 
have, I know, from little Don. I would give 
you every material comfort and all kindly 
consideration in my power. I would protect 
you in every way. And you would know 
the gfeel of sweeping distance, clean alr 
and sunlight, and the sweetness of purple 
evenings—the things I believe you said 
must mean to you ‘Arizona.’ I’m afraid 
that is all.” : 

“That is much.” The girl spoke with 
quiet feeting. She looked off over the 
tree tops and color from aroused emotion 
tinged her cheeks. Silence fell between 
them, but it was a pause that held Lan- 
ham tense as he watched her. 

“How strange,” she said, speaking a8 
in a reverie, “how different from any way 
1 had thought of it as coming!” She turned 
to face Lanham and the light of exctte- 
ment was in her eyes. “The way of 
‘Arizona!’ ”’ 

“You must see—” he interposed. 

“I do see. It isn’t that I am confused 
or bewildered; it is the thrill of having 
to decide one's action in a big way, on 
what lies unseen around a great bend in 
the trail. To stake one’s whole future on 
a single cast of judgment!”

she continued, “with one quick thrust fate

From the pastor’s stacy In an tcon- 
spicuous little church they went direetly 
to the train; and in the early evening, 
three days later,~Lanham brought the 
buckboard around to the adobe station for 
the drive to:the raneh, ; 

Darkness fell before they reached the 
ranch, and as they drew into the folds 
of some low hiils they encountered a 
blackness of night that made Helen won- 
der at the calm assurance with which 
Lanham sent the horses on at an wn- 
checked rapid pace. She could hear the 
slap and creak of harness ahead of her, 
but not a thing could she see of the team 
or the road. Imnstinctively she cowered 
low on the seat and clung closely to the 
little lad beside her, as though, to ward 
off a mysterioussly palpable something 


that continuously threatened to close in > 


and immerse her. : 

Quickly Lanham’s voice came _ out 
of the dark to soothe her unspoken mis- 
giving. 

“Another mile and you will sce our 
lights at the Broken Trigger, but it will 
take us more than half an hour to .reach 
them. You will find all of this very beau- 
tiful in the morning light.” 

The foreman and the Chinaman were 
the only ones to offer a welcome when 
they arrived; the men reticently kept to 
the bunkhouse. To Helen it was as though 
she had been carried blindfolded and 
placed upon a dimly lit stage, strangely 

Coming from her room the next morn- 
ing, she found Lanham waiting for her, 
standing before the wide firepiace. 

“It looks pretty rough and tousled,”’ he 
said, indicating the big room. “I’m seeing 
it through your eyes, and I’d no idea it 
was quite so awful. But you will know 
what it needs. When you’re ready I'll give 
you a few of the boys and you can hold a 
little roundup in here.” 

But Helen was not noticing the room. 
Her eyes were upon Lanham, bright with 
wonder. Booted and clothed for the sad- 
dle, he seemed to be even broader of 
shoulder and taller by inches. In gray 
doeskin breeches and a soft leather vest 
edged with a narrow band of Indian bead- 
work, a dull blue scarf knotted loosely 
about his throat, and silvered spurs at 
his heels, he seemed to have regained his 
native alement. The little power and gen- 
tle, dominant poise of the man stood forth 
with a touch of primitive splendor. She 
had not thought of him as handsome until 
this moment. ‘ 

Feeling her gaze upon him, he glanced 
down at his boots and explained: “I've 
been trying out a horse I wired Lee to 
break in for you. After breakfast we'll 
see’if you are pleased with him. There is 
a little butte three miles from here where 
{ would like you to meet ‘Arizona.’” 

“I feel that I am just meeting you,” 
Helen answered. “I wonder if I, too, can 
ever belong like that!” | 


HE following day Helen held her 

roundup. She could wait no lonfer 
to lay her hands upon the possibilities of 
the big room with its Navajo rugs and its 
generai spirit of frontier homeliness and 
rugged comfort. The boys came at Lan- 
ham’s command, shy and blundering be- 
fore the sweet voice and laughing dark 
eyes of the little “herd boss.” Their em- 
barrassment took the form of wild eyed, 
plunging rusbes to do her will. They 
seized upon furniture or swept up indis- 
criminate armfuls of anything loose at the

mere pointing of her finger, and huriled 
into one another in mad dashes for tne 


Stooping over the wood box with a 
broom, Bud Sellers prodded 4 dust laden 
package from the narrow space next to 
the wall. The size and weight and shape 
of the ‘seemed to awaken mem- 
ories in Bud. Stripping back a little or 
the torn wrapping from the end, he iden- 
tified the contents exactly. Lanham’s 
name, aS consignee, lettered boldly on 
th> label, completed the story. ; 

Bad crouched on hands and haanches, 
and, tilting his chin to the heavens, hs 
loosed a long, desolate howl—and another, 
and » im rising anguish. The 
sounds brought Helen from her iavestiza- 
tion of Lanham’'s room. 

“What in the name of mercy has ‘bap- 
pened now’” she asked. “What is it?” 
Bud solemnly handed her the packace. 
it happened ¢. long time xse, ma'am,” })° 
answered. “I reckon the Chief had ought 
to tell you. I just can’t. Ask him when 
the little fella ain't around,” he added, 
guardedly. 

Whea Lanham returned in the evening 
he stood in‘ the doorway and gazed. “The 
big room was marvelously aftered im ar- 
rangement, order and cleanliness. Entic- 
ing welcome reached out te him from 
every point with a sort of peace-giving 
benediction. Flowers and richly color:d 
groupings of wild shrub branches bricht- 
ened dell corners, and in the lampligiit at 
the center table Helén sat reading to Don. 

Lanham unbuckled his spurs and drop- 
ped them on the veranda by the door: aiid 
for the first time In many years he changed 
before supper to a suit of gray tweeds. 

Until Don’s bedtime, Helen read to 
him again after supper, finishing their 
story. Lanham sat im silence with iis 
cigar, watching the play of expression in 
the boy’s eyes as he listened, absorbed 
by thestale. And when they were alone, 
after Don had been tucked away, Helen 
brought out the mysterious package and 
asked Lanham why Bud Sellers - should 
have howled like a wolf when he discov- 
eréd it. She mimicked Bud's actions, and 
lanham found himself laughing whole- 
heartedly for the first time in many years 
in his own house. 

He untied the package and told Helen 
the story of their great Christmas fiasco 
of the winter before. 

“It will help you to understand how 
much I appreciate all this,” and he point- 
ed about the room. “And you--and al) 
you mean to us out here! This little gun 
marks the time when I first startedto 
find you.” 


S THE weeks of eari:y summer slipped 

by on the Broken Trigger Lanham 
watched with an indefinable seuse-of dis- 
turbance the transformation in Helen. He 
had wanted her to be happy for herself— 
his wish had been to have her reflect a 
spirit of warmth and light-heartedness 
about his boy; but it had not entered hits 
calculations that he himself should be 
affected. 

The boy was captivated by her. The 
old dog left his sunny steps by the kitchen 
and followed her about with fatuous grin 
and waving tail. Her presence amongst 
the punchers incited them to breakneck © 
capers of horsemanship. They yearned 
for dragons to slay at her feet. Not a-crea- 
ture on the home range seemed to be 


‘ left unmoved by her blithe charm. 


But Lanham was stirred by vague re- 
sentment. It was not in the bargain that 
she should involve him. He had expected 
his interest to hold to a general outer cir- 
cle of guardianship—and it was mot so. 

Yet, attempting to define any overt at- 
titude of attraction toward him, he was 
compelled to admit that she held unvary- 
ingly to a plane of cordia! impersonality. 
And this but added to his disquietude a 
querulous sense of pique. She seemed, 
in this light, irritatingly acceptant and 
content in their anomalous position. 

Returning to the big room one evening 


_after tuckin Don into bed, Helen lingered 


by the piano and trailed her fingers wist- 
fully over the keys. 

. “Would you mind,” she asked, 
were to play a bit?” 

“I didn’t know you played,” 
answered in surprise. 

“There is no—it wouldn’t spoil any- 
thing if I were to use it? I haven’t wanted 
to ask before.” 

“If there is any music in it—by all 
means. The old relic was just dumped on 
me in the cleanup of a bad debt. I'd been 
wondering what to do with it.” 

With a happy laugh Helen sat down 
and struck a series of’ low, biending. 
chords. : 

“You don’t know how afraid of you 
l’ve been since you came in,” she smiled 
over her shoulder. “A funny old man with 
a wabbly wagon and two burrors. drove 
in today and asked if we had things to be 
mended or any pianos to be tuned. I let 
him go ahead. And then I was afraid.” 
She lightly followed through :an old mel- 
ody as she talked. 

Lanham watched her throngh the blue 
haze of his cigar smoke. A stock journal 
slid from ‘his lap to the floor, unnoticed. 
In her dim corner the mellow light from 
the lamp, absorbed in the somber shad- 
ows, was reflected only by the genily 
swaying shoulders in light gown and acarf. 
She appeared as a phantom wrought by 
the spell of harmony—an evanescent flz-

HE new-born year leaps from that mystic box in which Time with his prestidigator’s art controls an unending supply of 
days and weeks and months and seconds and centuries; and with him leaps his companions, hope, ambition and de- 


termination. 


It’s one of the strangest and one of the wisest provisions of nature that once a year the turning of a calendar sheet 
should cause new fires to light in human souls or fires, dead or smouldering for months to revive and burn with new 


lustre. 


HERE is no telling just how much 

this annual appearance of the scantily- 
clothed year from the mystic box of time 
has accomplished. I recall distinctly a 
friend of mine, who in the old and un- 
regenerate days, got a new grip on him- 
self while the bells were chiming the ad- 
vent of the New Year. He had lost that 
grip ten minutes thereafter, but he hae 
made a start, and now he is a citizen of 
sobriety and respectability. 


And so it goes through every phase 
of life. I don’t suppose there’s a man 
or a woman in Atlanta who did not wake 
up this morning with some new spark 
of hope or ambition or determination or 
a tiny blaze of the whole three burning 
in his or her being. 


There is no telling what these little 
sparks may result in. They may burn 
out before breakfast is digested or they 
may prove so consuming fmm some folks— 
say our motorists, for instance—that they 
will drive thelr cars for the whole next 
twelvemonth with some slight regard 
for the life and limbs of other people in 
Atlanta. 


ND while on the subject of motor 
cars and their kindred, it might hap- 
pen that the advent of 1922 might bring 
the decision in the minds of a controliing 
majority of Atlanta’s general council to 
apply the brakes to partisan bickering and 


By Fuzzy Woodruff :: 


provide some streets for the motor cars 
to run over. 


While on the subject of awakened leg- ! 


islative conscience to public needs it 
might be well to suggest some of the 
most persistently wailing necessities of 
the current hour to which their minds 
and activities might best be applied. 


It seems to me that the most relent- 
less of all lawmakers, the persons who 
decree what shall be worn and what 
shall not be worn could pay attention 
with some profit by making their decrees 
apply more to those things that shall be 
worn than those things that shall net be 
worn, especially as regards the habili- 
ments of femininity. Again it might be 
suggested that whoever is responsible for 
the social dancing art should take just 
one more step in following the barbaric 
precedent of our aboriginal Americans. 
They have adopted and enlarged on the 
corn dance, having liquified the corn and 
jellified the dance, but it seems that they 
have omitted one of the most attractive 
features of that ancient savage rite. As 
far as I have been able to observe they 
burn no one at the stake nor offer up any 
other human sacrifice, thus omitting one 
of the finest touches of Savagery that 


weuld make the present’ terpsichorean 


style completely complete. 


PEAKING of human sacrifices, & might 

be entirely meet and proper for the 
New Year to awaken the conscience of 
Colonel Arkwright or General Atkinson 
—or vice versa as to title—and cause 
them to run at least one more car a day 
on the Forrest avenue line, te which I 
am, by force of circumstance, addicted. 
We, who ride public conveyances, have 
long recognized that we are fish, but the 
idea of being converted into sardines, is 
naturally repugnant. 

And we could go on suggesting ad in- 
finitum. It might be pointed out to the 
movie exhibitors that the sex drama has 
become as commonplaée as a yarn sock 
and not a bit more # interesting and it 
might be pointed out <0 our visiting thes- 
pians that jokes that were local to New 
York a year and a half ago and were 
never such howling jokes anyhow, have 
lost some of their zest and tang by the 
time their company works its weary way 
this far. 


The New Year is a propitious time for 
reformations, but too much can not be 
expected -aey of New Year. 


So let the chimes peal the glad tid- 
ings that ‘another era has dawned, in 
which a man can fight at least three hun- 
dred and sixty-five battles and win every 
dadgummed one of them—that is uniess 
his opponent is a woman.

Designated for This Work by the 
Former President. 


—~RESIDENT WILSON: kept on his 
®\| desk at Paris, during the peace 
conference, a large steel docu- 
ment box, with a spring lock. Il 
have seen him at the close of the 
| day, after the session of the 


council of four, methodically 
put into this box all the papers and 


memoranda which had come to him 
in the course of the day’s proceedings. 
From time to time, as the box filled up, 
and the documents were no longer re- 
quired, they were removed to larger boxes 
and trunks, one of them beautifully made 
by the ship’s carpenter of the “George 
Washington.” All of these were brought 
* home with~him to the white house. 

In the winter of 1920-1921 great pres- 
sure was brought to bear upon the presi- 
dent to give his own account of what hap- 

ened at Paris. He had been under long 
and bitter attack, and his friends, confi- 
dent that the best response to these criti- 
cisms was a true and complete account 
of the conference, urged him both by letter 
and by word of mouth to present the his- 
tory of the events, using actual records 
and documents. 

But the president, who had been des- 
perately fll, was weighed down with the 
burdens of his closing administration. 
Moreover, no man who ever'sat in the 
white house was so little self-explanatory 
as Mr. Wilson. He rarely defended him- 
self when attacked, nor gave his friends 
the ammunition for such a defense. His 
end of a personal controversy was silence 
—to some of his enemies, an infuriating 
silence. He seemed incapable of present- 
ing or dramatizing his own actions. A 
student of his voluminous speeches and 
writings will find few pages devoted to 
telling what he did, how he did it, or why. 
He has been a great actor upon the world’s 
stage, the chief figure in supreme events; 
but hé ‘does not readily visualize either 
events or personalities; his characteristic 
and instinctive interest is in ideas. He 
can tell what he thinks and hopes and 
believes—no living man can do it better— 
but he has no genius for telling what he 


did. 


fia December, 1920, he wrote to me as 
follows: 

“It is clear to me that it will not be 
possible for me to write anything such 
as you suggest, but I believe that you 
could do it admirably. . .. I have

The Story of the Paris Peace Conference Taken From 
Documents of Former President Wilson, Which 
Heretofore Have Never Been Given to 
the Public and Which Rested in a 
Steel Box Which Never Left 

- Mr. Wilson’s Side... 


the appendices, the rather tremendous 


bulk of some 1,800 typéwritten pages, le-. 
gal size, probably not far short of three- 


quarters of a million words, and give a re- 
markably faithful, and often vivid, account 
‘of the discussions from day to day. - Han- 


key was one of those incredibly able and | 


to have you go through them and see 
what they are and what the best use 
is that can be made of them. I plunk- 
ed. them into the trunk in Paris and 
have not had the time or physical 
energy even to sort or arrange them. 
I am looking forward with great sat- 
isfaction to the work you are propos- 
ing to do.” 

In January, 1921, I began working upon 
these documents at the white house. They 
were in two trunks and three steel boxes 
and for the most part had not been 
touched since the president put them aside 
in Paris. They.can be grouped in three 
categories: , 

First: The complete minutes from 
April 19 to June 24, 1919, of the council 
of four (which consisted of the president 
of the United States, Mr. Lloyd-George, 
the prime minister of Great Britain; M. 
Clemenceau, president of the Council of 
France. and Signor Orlando, premier of 
Itdly). 


VOLUMINOUS RECORDS 
KEPT OF MEETINGS. ° 


A widespread belief has existed that 
no records were kept of the crucially im- 
portant meetings of the four. It is true 
that the first two or three weeks of these 
conferences from about March 24 to April 
19, were entirely informal; and while no 
official minutes were made of the actual 
conversations, this period is excellently 
documented with memoranda, letters, re- 
ports, and copies of resolutions; and there 
exist informal records, such as my own, 
of daily conversations with the president, 
which fill the gap. After April 19, how- 
ever, and until the close of the confer- 
ence, a remarkably complete and methodi- 
cal record of the entire proceedings was 
kept. In one or two instances exact sten- 
ographic reports of the conversation are 
in existence; but for the most part the 
record was made in English by Sir Mau- 
rice Hankey, of the British foreign office, 
who was the secretary of the four. He 
was sometimes the only man present with 
the four or the three; but usually Man- 
taux, the French interpreter, was there 
and when Orlando attended he also had 


his secretary, Count Aldrovandi, with 
him; for Orlando was the only one ef the 
four who spoke no English. While Han- 
key’s minutes are not verbatim, but are 
written in the English style of isdirect 
narrative, reporting speeches and discus- 
sion in the third person, they.reach, with 


._the president’s own 


tions, resolutions, letters, which came per- 
.sonally to the president for help in a hun- 
dred causes—how the stricken people of 
the nations turned with hope and faith 
to America; how bitter the suffering was, 
and ‘how. vital the need. I- found the ex- 
amination of this material a breathless 
and exciting experience, like going through 
a treasure-chest not filled with gold, but 
with the’ very souls of mankind. Here, 


. BR for example, is a bulky petition from 17,000 


* Jugo-Slavs in the Fiume district beauti- 


‘2 tuly bound in embroidered: silk with an 
me eloguent statement of how the names had 


been collected, partly by girls and women, 
sometimes with great risk to themselves. 


m Here are pathetic appeals from starving 


efficient men of the super-secretarial 
type, who came into prominence at the 
peace conference. Mantaux was another, of 
whom I hope to speak again. 


HIS record of the council of four, to- 

gether with the minutes of the council 
of ten (consisting of the five chief repre- 
sentatives of tha great powers—America, 
France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan— 
each accompanied by his foreign minister) 
from January 12, 1919, to June 17 (al- 
though the ten, after March 15, met in- 
frequently), and the so-called council of 
foreign ministers, the “little five” (Sec- 
retary Lansing for America, Mr. Balfour 


‘for Great Britain, M. Pichon for France. 


Baron Sonnino for Italy and Baron Maki- 
no, though he was not a foreign minister, 
for Japan), from March 27 to June 12, to 
which I have also had access—these lat- 
ter records also comprising, with their 
appendices, over 1,200 typewritten pages. 
some half-million words—make up the 
complete ,and- only: official record of the 
peace conference; none of which has yet 
been published. 

Second: The second category: includes 
a large number of reports and memoranda 
made by the members of the American 
delegation for the president, also British 
and French reports that came into his 
hands in the course of the discussfons, 
together with many of the records and 
minutes of the subsidiary commissions, 
such as the supreme economic council, and 
the various expert and investigatory com- 
mittees. These documents contain much 
valuable historical material, revealing the 
attitude of the various nations represent- 
ed at Paris at each point in the discus- 
sions, and the exact opinions of the dele- 
gates and experts. 


WILSON MADE 
MARGINAL MEMORANDA. 

In this category, also, I should place 
invaluable memo- 
randa, often on the margins of documents, 


sometimes upon separate sheets written . 


upon his typewriter or in his own .steno- 
graphic hieroglyphics—which he has, in 
some cases, interpreted for the writer. 
Especially valuable and interesting ‘are 
the notations in the president’s hand 
showing the development of the league of 
nations covenant and the extraordiary 
number of changes made in certain of the 
articles. Here also are the original drafts 
of the covenants made by the president, 
Colonel House, Lord Robert Cécil, Baron 
Phillimore, General Smuts, M. Bourgeois, 
the Italian and Swiss schemes, and others. 
All this material came naturally ~ into 
the hands of Mr. Wilson. There is no- 
where probably a more complete-or ex- 
planatory record of every step in the de- 
velopment of the league covenant than 
this.

PRESIDENT NOT: IN 
CLOISTERED SECLUSION. . 


Those who have a picture of tha presi- 
dent immured in a kind of cloister at 
Paris and cut off from knowledge of what 
the world was thinking about, have, of 
course, no knowledge of these sources of 
information and advice. It was the com- 
monest experience, at Paris, to find eager 
delegations who had come hundreds of 
miles, often with difficulty and danger, 
trying to get to the president to give him 
information he already possessed. It 
would have been better, upon the human 
side, if the president could have seen face 
to face all these people—he did see an 
extraordinary variety of them—for they 
would have gone away feeling that they 
had a real part in shaping the fate of the 
world; but this was not- only physically 
impossible, but it was not the way the 
president worked. His training in ail his 
previous life, it should not be forgoiten, 
had been that of the scholar, the student, 


- not the politican. accustomed to getting 


his information not from people but out 
of books, documents, letters, the written 
word. Having thus the essence of the 
matter, he probably underestimated the 
value of these human contacts. And ‘co 
often it was not real. information these 
delegations had to offer, but arguments, 
propaganda, irrelevant appeals for sym- 
pathy. 


EVERYBODY 
KEPT A DIARY. 


N THE preparation of this history the 

writer has also had the great advan- 
tage of many conversations both at Paris 
and since with various members of the 
commissions, both American and foreign, 
and has been able thus to supplement bis 
own knowledge of specific events. He 
has also had the good fortune to see the 
personal records made by some of the 
men who were there. 
never was:a conference in which every 
human being present was so struck with 
a kind of historic awe. Almost everyone, 
except the president, kept a diary, of 
which the president was undoubtedly the 
central object, the chief interest. Some 
of them wrote surreptitiously, some boldly 
and without shame. Secretary Lansing 
was an indefatigable diarist. I remember 
seeing him many times sitting alone in his 
big empty office, writing in a small neat 
book, in a small, neat, formal hand. When 
one came in to talk with him, he would 
lay down his pen, reach for a pad of 
paper, and during the conversation draw 
one after another pencil sketches of 
strange, grotesque and sinister faces. He 
worked equally well with his right or left 
hand. In the course of the months at 
Paris, for he occupied his time in the con- 
ferences in the same way, he must have 
drawn thousands of such pictures. 


Colonel House dictated his record to 
his secretary, sitting on a long couch 
with a gay-colored blanket thrown over 
his legs. He spoke in. a smooth, even 


I suppose -there.

a special commissioner of the state de- 
partnient. visiting England, France and 
Italy, and making a series of reports upon, 
certain economic and political conditions 
in the allied countries. These reports 
went primarily to the state department 
and also to Colonel House who was at the

quiry, and some were transmitted divect 
to the president himself. In the course

had also a close view of the war itself 
on the French and Belgian fronts, and in 
Italy; I saw the- stupendous efforts of 
‘our own army, and, at first hand, the de- 
yastation wrought by the Germans. Tris 
experience I found invaluable in giving 
me a clear understanding of the back- 
grounds of tho peace canference; the real 
foundations of military force and eco- 
nomic need upon which it rested: and 
the atmosphere of suffering, dread, hatred.

BAKER APPOINTED TO 
DIRECT PRESS ARRANGEMENTS. 

In December, 1918, several weeks he- 
fore the peace conference opened, Presi- 


dent Wilson appointed the writer to direct 
the press arrangements of the American 


Colonel House, wherein he also outlined 


the general method of publicity to be em- § 


ployed: 


My Dear House: 

T have been thinking a great deal 
lately about the contact of the com- 
mission with the public through the 
press and particularly about the way 
in which» the commission should dea) 
with the newspaper men’ who have 
come over’from the United States. .! 
‘have come to’ the conclusion that 
much. the bost way to handle the mat- 
ter is for you and the other commis- 
‘sioners to hold & brief meeting each 
day and invite the representatives of 
the press to come in at each meeting 
for such interchange of information 
or suggestion ag may be thought nec- 
essary. This I am sure is preferable 
to any formal plan or to any less dofi- 
nite arrangement. : 

~- [am convinced also that.the prep- 
aration of all the press matter that is 
to be issued from the commission is 
a -task. calling for a particwlar sort of 
experieneed ability. I beg, therefore. 
that you and your fellow commission- 
ers will agree to the appointment o!? 
Mr, Ray Stannard Baker as your rep- 
resentative in the performance of this 
duty. Mr. Baker enjoys my confi- 
dence, in a very high degree and J 
have no hesitation in commending him 
to you as.a man of ability, vision and 
ideals. He has been over here for 
the better part of a year, has estab- 
lished relationships which will be of 
the highest value, and is particularly 
esteemed by the. very class of persons 
to whom it will be most advantageous 
to us to be properly interpreted in 
the news that we have to issue. If 
you see no conclusive objection to 
this, I would suggest that you request 
My. Baker to do us the very great 
service of acting in this capacity. 

I am writing in the same terms to 
the other members of the commission. 

Sincerely yours, - 


(Signed) WOODROW WILSON. 


So it became my task to organize the 
press bureau of the American commission 
and offices were opened at No. 4 Place ce 
la Concorde, near the Hotel Crillon. 
Through this office passed all the official 
news of the conference: and it became, 
moreover, a center at which gathered the 
representatives of all the delegations and 
commissions from all countries that came 
to Paris; everyone who was seeking the 
support of American influence and Amer- 
ican opinion. and who was not? We also

saw all the various delegations: from 


America; the Irish, the Jews, the labor 
leaders, the Women’s organizations, the 
negroes. It was one of the busiest: offices 
of the commission. : 

The writer’s duties brought him into 
contact with the American commissioners 
every morning before the daily session 
with the correspondents, and during all 
the later months of the conference he saw 
the president each afternoon following the 
close of the session of the council of four 
(sometimes oftener), went over fully the 
happenings of the day, determined upon 
exactly what should be made public, and 
afterward met the American correspond- 
ents. He crossed the ocean three times 
on the “George Washington” with the 
president and was able to serve him, in 
several instances, in important matters 
not connected with publicity. The supreine 
economic council also appointed him as 
a member of the board of four men. one 
from each nation, fo direct its publicity, 
and the records of this important commis- 
sion thus came into his hands. 


TH press bureau, under his direction, 
had charge of making and transmit- 
ting the American summary of the treaty. 

The writer offers no excuse for the 
personal note he employs in various parts 
of this narrative; for only thus can he 
convey what he himself saw and knew. 
He is doing it also with the intent of mak- 
ing it clear that the judgments of men and 
events are his own and not those of the 
president.. The president’s own views are 
expressed with great completeness in the 
documents, memoranda and letters which 
are here reproduced or quoted from. 


WRITER SOMETIMES 
DISAGREED WITH WILSON. 


It is only honest to say that the writer 
did not agree with the president in some 
of his conclusions at Paris, and argued, 
before the decision was made, a different 
course of action from the one taken, as 
in the Shantung matter. He finds in his 


journal of April 29: 4 % 


“l went up to the president’s house 
at nine o’clock this morning where I 
laid before him the notes I had made 
together with various memoranda 
furnished to me by Williams and 
Hornbeck (the Far Eastern experts), 
and by Wellington Koo and others of 
the Chinese delegation. There is na 
possible doubt where the president's 
own sympathies lie. He is for the full 
rights of the Chinese. I told him 
that the sympathy of the world was 
undonhbtedly with the Chinese. 

“‘T know that,’ he said. 


“I made as strong a case as I 
could for the Chinese position, urging 
some postponement at least. The 
president pointed out how inextricably 
the whole matter was tied up witb 
the old secret treaties, how Britain 
felt herself bound to Japan, and how. 
with Italy already out of the confer- 
ence and Belgium bitterly discontent- 
ed, the defection of Japan, not an un- 
reasonable possibility, might not only 
break up the peace.conference, but 
destroy the league of nations.”

_- lt was also. my belief that a much 


broader publicity, a constructive publicity, 
‘could have been had at the conference 
and-this view was frequently urged upen 
the president and upon the commission- 


ers. I still believe that one of the greatest 
mistakes made at the conference, particu- 
larly for America, was a want of better 
understanding of what happened there 
and the exact reasons why, in each par- 
ticular: case, the president decided as he 
did. for I am confident that if the Ameri- 
can people could know what the prob- 
lems were in shell-shocked Europe in 
1919, the problems those desperately har- 
assed leaders at Paris had to meet, there 
would today be a better and more sympa- 
thetic understanding of our newly devel- 
oping international relationships: This 
whole problem of publicity and secrecy at 
Paris wil) be considered: in a later chap- 
ter. 


But it must he cl 
lieyed then in the e 
great principles the | 
at Paris and do so s t I had then, 
and have still, complete th in the abso- 
lute sincerity of the president's purpose; 
and the conviction that whatever may 
have been his mistakes, he fought for his 
principles under such difficulties and in 
such an atmosphere as the American peo- 
ple do not yet understand. 


WHAT WILSON’S 
FAILURE SHOWED. 


| HE president did not in those brief 
months achieve the “new world,” the 
‘new order,” he so nobly phrased, so ar- 
dently desired, and so continuously fought 
for, but he chose the battle-ground and 
set. forth the issues which will engage the 
thought of the world for many years to 
come. And there fs no more instructive 
failure—if it was failure!—than the presi- 
dent’s at Paris, for when we approach it 
with a desire not to condemn or defend, 
but to understand, it reveals, as nothing 
else could, the real elements of the strug- 
gle which the liberals of the world have 
vet before them. We see as in a spet- 
light the defects of our own governmental 
machinery as it concerns foreign affairs; 
we are able to judge more clearly the 
state of our own public opinion, and above 
all to get a truer sense of our relation- 
ships with the other great nations of the 
world. 
Finally, we see in high relief the fig- 
ure of an extraordinary human being; with 


said that I be- 
truth of the 
t laid down 


supreme qualities of many kinds, with 


temperamental and physical limitations, 
who will never cease to fascinate the his- 
torian and biographer of representative 
and decisive characters. 

Unless Americans can apprehend what 
really happened at Paris, what forces we 
had to meet there, how we were led, and 
what we did, we can scarcely go ahead 
with firm ground under our feet, to dis- 
cuss what to do next. Paris must assured-’ 
ly be the springboard for any future 
plunge into foreign affairs. Consequently 
this is an American narrative, from an 
American point of view. It is the account 
of what happened by one who was there, 
who knew the men engaged, and who had 
then and has had since, in even larzer 
measure, a full access t® the documents— 
not merely the formal recorss, Dut those 
tentative proposals, m@moranda, and cor- 
respondence, which often reveal, in their 
irapulsive sincerity, later smoothed into 
conventional complaisances, the true pur- 
puses, the real desires, of the actors upon 
thit great stage.

Once Favorite of a King, 
She. Now Seeks Work 


Katti Schratt, Companion of Emperor Francis Joseph 
for Many Years, Is Impoverished in Her Old Age 
and Will Appear on the Stage in America. 


necessities of life. 


She is not coming to exploit her ro- 
mance. She who has loved and 
by one of the most renowned of 
burgs, who has seen the dynasty of 
Hapsburgs in its power and its downfall, 
will not desecrate what lies closest te her 
aged and withered heart. 


She is a poor old woman now, but her 
love is a sacred thing, her fondest memory. 
She will not speak of it, write of it, permit 
it to be made into a motion: picture, or re- 
veal in any way her intimaté acquaintance 
with the Hapsburg family affairs gained 
during the years she was the trusted con- 
fidant of Franz Joseph. 

Nearing seventy years of age, she is 
planning to return to the profession she 
left as a young woman in her twenties to 
devote herself te the emperor. She will 
play the role of a grandmother in a drama 
that has been written for her. 

Katti was a star in the Vienna Court 
theater when the emperor lost his admit- 
tedly susceptible heart to her. He was re- 
garded as one of the sanest and healthiest 
of his unstable and degenerate family, 
made eccentric and mentally weak by gen- 
erations of consanguineous marriages. He 
was married to a lovely woman, Elizabeth, 
the youngest daughter of Duke Max of 
Bavaria; but he counted in his royal right 
to indulge himself in his general fondness 
for pretty women. This he did to such an 
extent that Elizabeth gradually began to 
consider herself not a wife but a “dutiful 
sovercign lady.” 


O It was that when the emperor, seated 

in his box‘at the Hofburg theater in Vi- 
enna, saw Katti Schratt act and was fasci- 
nated by her, he was accompanied to the 
star's dressing room after the show by the 
exquisite Empress Elizabeth, grown toler- 
an‘ after years of pain and hurt pride. 


Wellbred and self-controlHied, Elizabeth 
looked on as the entranced eyes. of her 
royal spouse met those cf Katti Scehratt, 
born the daughter of a baker but risen to 
fame as an interpreter of Isben roles; and 
a famous romance began. 

Katti Schratt was. deeply appreciative 
of the honor conferred upon her by the 
visit of the emperor and empress. She lis- 
tenod in modest confusion to the compli- 
ments of Franz Joseph and made deep 
obeisances to the kindly but regal empress. 


She had once before spoken with the 
empciror. Franz Joseph liked to have his 
subjocts think that he was solicitougs con- 
cerning their personal welfare. Shortly 
before he had instituted th: custom of 
opening his palace to the people and of 
being accessible himself for a short time 
once a week to anyone who had a request

expect reyal visitors in her dressing room.

thought he might remedy. 

Katti Schratt, young and seductive 
woman of the stage, a dancer ang singer 
as well as a dramatic ac‘ress, had gone,

to the palace, xnelt before the emperor and

It was because Katti .ad presented her

that the emperor decided to see her act. 
The empress accompanied him to the the-

tell the actress of thcir appreciation of her 
artistry in person after the end of the play. 
The emperor accepted the sujgestion read- 


fering, the courageous, who acted’ to quiet 
the tongue of scandal. 


One day after she had experienced a 
series of humiliations because of her hus- 
band’s affair with the actress, she decided 
that something must be done. The situa- 
tion for her was almost unbearable. 

Taking’ her baby daughter, she set out

had left in order te call on the actress.’ 


Franz Josef was old when he died and his 
Katti had helped him through many sorrows. 


After that no one dared to gossip in Eliza- 
beth’s presence abou* Franz Joseph and his 
Katti. Elizabeth had given social sanction 
to the affair. 

Thus Katti Se_ratt became a “national 
institution.” ‘The people took it for grant- 
ed, as did his wife and children, that their 
ruler derived much pleasure from his com- 
panionship with Katti. \/hen they thought

Often in merry. conversation they spoke of 
him as “Herr Schratt.” 

The teal Herr Schratt, Katti’s husband, 
was appointed to a government position 
that kept him employed to useful purpose 
at quite a distance away. 

The emperor gave Katti an allowance, 
Also a town house and a country house 
within a stone’s throw of his own palaces. 
She lived quietly. The emperor called on 
her every day for an hour or two. Often 
he came for afternoon tea and stayed 
through the evening. 

Usually, however, he dined in state at 
the palace with a guest or two. Dined on 
gold plate with flunkies in pale blue, pink 
ard gold serving the‘dishes. At the close 
of the meal ceremonious leave would be 
taken and the emperor would go to his 
study. It was not yet 8 o'clock. 

Then by a tiny secret elevator, the door 
ef which appeared to be a bookcase, he 
would descend two stories to an unused 
courtyard where an automobile awaited 
him. This saved a detour of half a mile 
through halls and rooms.

dig SCHRATT, devoting herself to 
the emperor had grown into a serious- 
minded woman. Out of young womanhood 


_into maturity and old age she passed, liv- 


ing for Franz Joseph. His subjects were 
no longer scandalized by their relationship 
as it lengthened into old age, for it was not 
so much a passionate rommance as a domes- 
tic idyll. 

When the emjeror was seventy he gave 
his left hand in marriage to Katti, formed 
a morganatic alliance with her. By this 
time the Empr-ss Elizabeth was dead, as- 
sassinated by an anarchist. Elizabeth and 
Franz Joseph had been estranged for twen- 
ty years, but he had never ceased to re- 
spect and almost to adore her. She had 
been called the most beautiful woman in 
Europe. She was a true queen. ~ 

Franz Joseph took the death of Eliza- 
beth greatly to heart. For a time’ he saw 
Katti only in secret, never in public. 

Franz Joseph died in 1916 at the age of 
eighty-seven. Katti was not with him, 
though their affection continued to the last. 
He died in the palace where he had direct 
telegraph wires from the Austro-Hungarian 
and German military headquarters. A smile 
was seen to flicker on his withered but 
rugged old face when he received his last 
war report, “Victory! Craiova has fallen.” 

He had been a ruler for sixty-eight 
years. He had seen modern Europe devel- 
oped and had lived a life of many sorrows. 
His reign had been full of turmoil and dif- 
ficulty. Upon his shoulders had even been _ 
placed the responsibility of starting the 
worid war by demanding vengeance for the 
killing of the Hapsburg heir at Sarajevo 
in ~914. 

Katti has lived on, in the little villa 
where the royal “Herr Schratt” found ref- 
uge and relaxation from his heavy duties. 

The allowance that Franz Joseph gave 
her was stopped. Further, she became 
pressed financially because of war condai- 
tions. Now she is poverty-stricken. 

But within her still burns that lively 
dramatic spirit which brought her fame 
even before an emperor made her his 
favorite. She will act again.

OW that Sir Oliver Lodge bas come out firmly

the possibilities there is an intense revival of 
curiosity with regard to the experiments which 
it is known that Senator Marconi is making

Everything seems to confirm the statements recent-

Senator Marconi evidently has not the slightest in-

in the wireless room of the extraordimary craft, not for 
hours, alone, but for days and even nights at a time, 
forgetting sleep, meals and every recreation. 

During these periods of absorption no one disturbs 
him unless sent for. He never makes much comment 
after the long, mysterious vigils have ended. Marconi 
never has been one to gossip about tasks in process of 
accomplishment. When a thing actually has been ‘done 
he talks about it. Until it actually has been done he 
does not digseuss it with outsiders. 


"T°HE “Electra” is the most perfectly equipped .ma- 
chine in all the world for such experimentation as 
now absorbs Marconi. No investigator ever has worked 
under more favorable conditions. 
The best part of its equipment, for his’ wireless 
experimentation, according to the great inventor, is 
the fact that it can carry him away at his own will 
from the possibility of interruption. Marconi ever has 
considered something in the way of solitude an abso- 
lute essential to concentrated thought, and, of course, 
withcut concentrated thought it would be impossible 
for him to hope for real success in his investigations 
in the newest of all sciences to which he has dedicated 
his life 

Lie speaks of his laboratory on the “Electra” as his 
“research” place, although he has on dry land half a 
dozen others variously located and even more elabo- 
rately equipped, a fact made passible, of course, by 
plenty of space, whereas his working quarters on the 
yacht are necessarily circumscribed. 

Just what the present cruise will produce in the way 
of marvels mo one can guess, of course, but there is 
a tenseness and interest among alt shore associates 
of the great electrician which would indicate that 
something of great moment is expected, although none 
will positively admit that anything Marconi himself has 
said has justified such expectations. 


PERSISTENT rumor obtajns that the world-famous 

Italian is arranging for a later cruise upon which 
his guests will be the world’s very greatest electrical 
scientists. It is said that already Senator Marconi has 
written to the great Edison, in the United States, beg- 
ging him to be a member of a party during the coming 
winter to cruise on the “Electra” in the Mediterranean 
and that certain other great scientists of England and 
France also have been invited te be members of the 
party. 

It is held improbable that Senator Marconi, who saw 
the horrors of the German and Austrian work in north- 
ern italy and elsewhere during the war, will ever in- 
vite any scientist from these nations to co-operate with 


(Concluded on Page 2) 


him in scientific investigations, but he is believed te 
be planning a great party ef the most distinguished 
frém the allied countries te occur during the next 
or seven months. . ee 

Is it because he expeets to have some tremendous 
announcement to make that he is preparing for such 
a distinguished cruising party? 

It must be admitted frankly that all this is merest 
gossip; but it sems to fit with various bits of circum- 
stantial evidence. K is given credence here. . 


“|= ELECTRA” is accustomed to the company of 
the truly great. Whenever the great inventor’s 
boat puts into a port upen the Mediterranean notabili- 
ties who happen to be within reach swarm to pay their 
compliments to the discoverer of radiography and in- 
vitations to go aboard are as eagerly sought as bids 
to a court function in Lendon—even by society nota- 
bles. 

Sometimes these latter, who are welcomed with en- 
thusiasm by the great inventor's wife, fail to see 
Marconi altogther. If he has important experiments 
under way in his laboratory, which holds among other 
things a bunk, he may rot desert them even for so 
short a time as might be necessary for a hand-shaking 
tour about the yacht te greet his guests. 

* And none, even among the most formal and distin- 
guished of those who may be upon the yacht, will take 


 Qffense if such a thing occurs. So great a man as Sena- 


tor Mareoni is above social laws. | 

The political, social and even royai notabilities who 
so frequently are visitors upon the boat, never are 
invited into the wireless laboratory, or, if they are, 
are given but a glimpse at its, to them, mysterious 
wonders. . 

But not infrequently some workman, who hag shown 
intelligent interest in electrical phenomena in some 
shore-laboratory, may be intimately shown about, may 
be taken, so to speak, into the inventor’s scientific con- 
fidence. 

It is not impossible that some very humble person 
of high technical ability and no social claims, even of 
slight knoweldge of the deep faets underlying the great 
science of wireless communication, may hear of epoch- 
making new discoveries long hefore they are announced 
to even the exclusive scfentifie werld which waits with 
such respectful cu- 
riosity for any mes-

Peter Ruff. and the Double Four 


By &. Phillips Oppenheim 
The ‘Aibaasdidod S Wife | 


(Copyright, 1921, for The Constitution. ) *. 


[AONE in his ‘study, with fast- 
locked door, Peter, Baron de 
Grest, sat reading, word by word, 
with zealous care the dispatch 
from Paris which had just been 
delivered into his hands. From 
the splendid suite of reception 
rooms which occurpied the whole 
of the left-hand side of the hall came the 
faint sound of m ‘The street outside 
was filled with automobiles and carriages 
setting down their guests) Madame was 
receiving tonight a gathering of very dis- 
tinguished me and women, and it was 
only fer a few moments, and on very 
urgent business indeed, that her husband 
had dared to leave her side. 

The room in which he sat was in dark- 
ness except for the single heavily shaded 
electric lamp which stood by his elbow. 
Nevertheless, there was sufticient il!umi- 
nation to show that Peter had achieved 
one, at least, of his ambitions. He was 
wearing court uress, with 
black silk stockings and diamond buckles 
upon-his shoes. A red ribbon was in his 
buttonhol2 and a French order hung from 
his neck. His passion for clothes was cer- 
tainly amply ministered to luy the exigen- 
cies of his new position. Once more he 
rea@ those last few words of ‘nis unexpect- 
ed _y .received dispatch, read them with a 
frown upon his forehead and the light of 
troyble in his eyes. For three months he 
had done nothing but live the life of an 
ordinary man of fashion and wealth. His 
first task, for which, to tell the truth, he 
had been anxiously waiting, was here be- 
fore him, and he found it litue to his lik- 
ing. Again, he read slowiy to himself the 
last paragraph of Sogrange’s letter: 

“As ever, dear friend, one of the great- 
est savings which the men of my race have 
e-er perpetrated once more justifies itself 
—‘Cherchez la femme!’ Of monsieur we 
have no maaner of doubt, w. have tested 
him in every way. And to all appearance 
madame should also be above suspicion. 
let those things of which I have spoken 
have happened. For two hours this morn- 
ing | was closeted with Picon here. Very 
reluctantly he has. paced the matter in 
my hands. I pass it on to you. it 1s your 
first undertaking, cher baron, ana I wish 
vou bon fortune. A man of gallantry, as 
i know you are, you may regret that it 
should be a woman, cad a beautiful woman, 
too, against whom the finger must be 
pointed. Yet, after all, the fates are strong 
ani the task is yours. . SOGRANGE.” 

The music from the reception rooms 
grew louder and more insistent. Peter 
rose to ‘his feet, and moving to the fire- 
place, struck a match and carefuliy de- 
stroyed the letter which he hau “®°n reau- 
ing. Then he _ straightened * *himself, 
glanced for a moment at tne mirror, and 
left the room > ,oin his guests.

“K ONSIEUR LE BARON jesis,” 

i lady murmured. 

The Baron de Grost shook his head. 

“Indeed, no, madame!” he answered 
ea-nestly. “France has o1fered us noth- 
ine more delightful in the whole history 
ot owr entente than the loan ot yourseif 
and your brilliant husband. Monsieur de 
“hamborne: makes history amc: © us politi- 
cally, white macame—” 

The baron sighed, and his companion 
jeaned a little towards him; aer dark eyes 
were fuil of sentimental regard. 

“Yes?” she murmured. “Continue. It is 
my wish.” 

“tf am the good friend of Monsieur de 
Lamborne,.” tke baron said, and in his 
tone there seemed to lurk some far-away 
touch of regret, “yet madame knows thrat 
her conquests here have been many.” 

The ambassador's wife fanned herself 
and remained silent for a moment, a faint 
smile playing at the corners of her full, 
curving lips. She was, indeea, a ve-_ beau- 
tiful woman—elegant, a Parisienne to the 
finger-tips, with pale checks, but eyes 
dark and soft; eyes trained to her serv- 
ice. whose flash was ap inspiration, 
whose very droop had set beating the 
hearts of men less. susceptibie than the 
Baron de Grost. Her gown was magnifi- 
cent, of amber satin, a color daring, but 
splendid; the outline of her figure, as she 
leaned slightly back in her seat, might 
indeed have been traced by the inspired 
finger of some great seulptor. De Grost, 
whose reputation as.a mar of gallan 
was well estatished, felt the whole charm 
of her presence—felt, too, the subtle in- 
dications of preference which she seemed 
inclined to accor. to him. There was 
nothing which eyes could say which hers 
were not saying during those few minutes. 
Tne baron, indeed, glanced around a little 
neryously. His wife had still her mo- 
ments of unreasonableness; it was just as 
well that she was with some -of 
her guests at the farther end of the apart- 
ments. 

“You are trying to turm my head,” his 
beautiful companion whispered. “You flat- 
ter me.” 

“It is nut possible,” he answered. 

Again the fan fluttered for a moment 
before hér face. She sighed.

“Ah, monsieur!” she continued, drop- ) 


ping her voice until it scarcely rose above 
a whisper, “there are not many men like 
you. You speak of my husband and bis 
political gifts. Yet what, after all, do they 
amount to? What is his position, indeed, if 
one glanced behind the scenes, compared 
with yours?” 


HE face of the Baron de Grost became 

like a maSk. It was as though sud- 
ac nly he had feit the thrill of danger close 
at hand, danger even in that scented at- 
mosphere wherein he sat. 


“Alas, madame!” he answered, “it is 
you, now, who are pleased to jest. Your 
husband. is a great and powerful ambas- 
sador. i, unfortunately, have no career, 
no place in life save the place which the 
possession of a few million gives to a suc- 
cessful financier.” 


She laughed very softly, and ica her 
eyes spoke to him. 

“Monsieur,” she murmured, “you and 
i together ceuald make a great alliance, is 
it not so?” 

.- “Madame,” he faltered, doubtfully, “if 
one dared hope—” 

Once more the fire of her eyes, this 
time not only voluptuous. Was the man 
stupid, she wondered, or only cautious? 

“If that alliance were once concluded, 
she said, softly, “one might hope for every- 
thing.” 

“If it rests only with me,” 
seriously, “oh, madame!” 

- He seemed overcome. Madame was gra- 
cious, but was he really stupid or only 
very: much in earnest? 


he began, 


by tomorrow night’s mail.” 

“How do you know that?” 

The ambassador hesitated. 

“We, teo, have spies at. work,” he re- 
marked grimly. “Bernadine ‘wrote and 
sent a méssenger with the letter to Berlin. 
The man’s body is. drifting down ‘the 
Channel, but the letter is in my pocket.” 


““The letter from Bernadine?” 

“VYoeos.’’ 

“What does he say?” 

“Simply that a verbatim copy of the 
document in question will be dispatched 
to Berlia tomorrow evening, without fail.” 

“There are no secrets between us,” 
De Grost declared, smoothly. “What is 
the special importance of this document?” 


_ De Lamborne shrugged his shoulders. 

“Since you ask,” he said, “I will tell 
you. You know of the slight coolness 
which there has been between our respec- 
tive governments, 
that the policy of your ministers in ex- 
pending all their energies and resources 
in the building of a great fleet to the 
utter neglect of your army is a wholly 
one-sided arrangement, so far as we are 
concerned. In the event of a simultaneous 
attack by Germany upon France and Eng- 
land, you would be utterly powerless to 
render us any measure of assistance. If 
Germany should attack England alone, it 
is the wish of your government that we 
should be pledged to occupy Alsace-Lor- 
raine. You, on the other hand, could do 
nothing for us, if Germany’ s first move 
were made against France.”

kings,” she whispered, “it is wonderful— 
that. It is power—supreme, absolute pow- 
er. There is nothing greater.” 

Then the baron, who was watching her 
closely, caught another gleam in her eyes, 
and he began to understand. He had seen 
it before among a certain type of her 
country-women—the greed of money. He 
looked at her jewels and he remembered 
that, for an ambassador, her husband was 
reputed to be a poor map. The cloud of 
misgiving passed away from him; he set- 
tled down to the game. 

, ‘dé money could only buy the desire 
of one's heart,” he murmured. “Alas!” 

His eyes seemed to seek out Monsieur 
de Lamborne among the moving throngs. 
a laughed softly and her hand brushed 

s. 

“Money amd one other thing, Mensieur 
le Baron,” she whispered in his ear, “can 
buy the jewels from a crown—<can buy, 
even, the heart of a woman—” 


A movement of approaching guests’ 


caught them up,and parted them for a 
time: The Baroness de Grost was at home 
from ten till one, and her rooms were 
crewded.: The Baron found himself drawn 
on"one side, a few minutes later, by Mon- 
sieur de Lamborne himself. 

“I have been looking for you, De 
Grest,” the latter declared. “Where can 
we talk for a moment?” 


H* host took the ambassador by the 
arm and led him into a retired corner. 
Monsieur de Lamborne was a tall, slight 
man, Somewhat cadaverous looking, with 
large features, hollow eyes, thin but care- 
fully arranged gray hair, and a pointed 
gray beard. He wore.a friiled shirt, and 
an eye-ziass suspended by a broad black 
ribbon hung down upon his chest. His 
face, as a rule, was imperturbable enough, 


y disturbed. 

sWe cannot be overheard here,”- De 
Sirost remarked. “It must be an affair 
a Tewewords only, though.” 

Mougieur de Lamborne wasted no time 
in preliminaries. 

“This afternoon,” he said, “I received 
from my government papérs of immense 
importance, which I am te hand over to 
your foreign minister at 11 o’clock tomeor- 
row morning.” 

The Baron nodded. 

“Well?” 


Feat had the air, just now, of a man 


HE Baron was deeply interested, al- 

though the matter was no new one 
to him. 

“Go on,” 


he directed. “I am waiting 


for you to tell me the specific contents . 


of this document.” 

“The English government has asked 
us two questions: first, how many com- 
plete army corps we consider she ought 
to place at our disposal in this eventu- 
ality; and, secondly, at what point skould 
we expect them to be concentrated. The 
dispatch which I received tonight con- 
tains the reply to these questions.” 


“Which Bernadine ~has promised to 
forward to Berlin tomorrow night,” the 
Baron remarked, softly. 

De Lamborne nodded. 

“You perceive,” he said, “the immense 
importance of the affair. The very erist- 
ence of that document is almost a casus 
belli.” 

“At what time did the dispatch ar- 
rive,” the Baron asked, “and what has 
been its histery since?” 

“It arrived at 6 o’clock, and went 
straight into the inner pocket of my coat; 
it has not been out of my possession for 
a single second. Even while I talk to you 
I can feel it.” 

“And your plans? How are you in- 
tending to dispose of it tonight?” — 


“On my return to the embassy I shall’ 


place it. in the safe, lock it up, and re- 
main wetching it until morning.” 

“There doesn’t seem to be much chance 
for Bernadine,” the Baron remarked 
thoughtfully. 

“But there must be no chance—no 
chance at all,” Monsieur de Lamborne 
asserted, with a note of.passion in his- 
thin voice. “It is incredible, preposterous.

together.” 

De Grost reflected for a moment. 

“Bernadine makes few mistokes,” he - 
said thoughtfully. 

Monsieur de Lamborne sasted his hand 
across his foreliead. 

“Do I not know it?” he muttered. “In 
this instance though, it seems impossible 
for him to succeed. The time is so short 
and the conditions so difficuM. I may 
count upon your assistance, Baron?”

perhaps by accident that kis eyes met 
those of Madame de Lamberme, but she 
smiled’ at him subtly, more, perhaps, with 
her wonderful eyes tham her lips them- 
selves. She was the centre of a very bril- 
liant group, a most beautiful woman hold- 


‘ing court, as was only right amd proper, 


among her admirers. The Baron sighed. 
“No,” he said, “I shall not return with 


you, De. Lamborne. I want you to follow 
my suggestions, if you will.” 

“But, assuredly!” 

“Leave here early and go to your club. 
Remain there until one, then come to the 
embassy. I shall be there awaiting your 
arrival.” 

“You mean that you will go there 
alone? J do not understand,” the ambas- 
sador protested. ‘“‘Why should | go to my 
club? I do not at all understans. a 

“Nevertheless, do as I say,” De Grost 
insisted. “For the present, excuse me. I 
nuist -look after my guests.” 


The music had ceased, there was a 


‘movement toward the supper-room. The 


Baron offered his arm to Madame de Lam- 
borne, who welcomed -him with a brilliant 
sniile. Her husband, although, for a 
Frenchman, he was by no means of a 
jealous disposition, was conscious of a 
vague feeling of uneasiness as he watched 
them pass out of the room together. A 
few minutes later he made his excuses to 
his wife and with a reluctance for which 
he could scareely account left the house. 
There was something in the air, he felt, 
which he did not understand. He would 
not have admitted it to himself, but he 
more than half divined the truth. The 
vacant seat in his wife’s “carriage was 
filled that night by the Baron de Grost. 

At 1 o’clock precisely Monsieur de 
Lamborne returned to his house and heard 
with well-simulated interest that Monsieur 
le Baron de Grost awaited his arrival in 
the library. . He f@und De Grost gazing 
with obvious respect at the ponderous 
safe let into the wall. 

“A very fine affair—this,"’ he remark- 
ed, motioning with his head toward it. 

“The best of its kind,” Monsieur de 
Lamborne admitted. “No burglar yct has 
ever succeeded in opening one of fts type. 
Here is the packet,” he added, drawing 
the document from his pocket. “You shal) 
see me place it in Sefety myself.” 

The Baron stretched out his hand and 
examined the sealed envelope for a mo- 
ment closely. Then he moved to the writ- 
ing table, and, placing it upon the letter 
seales, made a note of its exact weight. 
Finally, he watched it deposited in the pon- 
derous safe, suggested the word to which 
the leck was set, and closed the door. Mon- 
sieur de Lamborne heaved asigh of relicf. 


“I fancy this time,” he said, “that our 
friends at Berlin wiil be disappointed. 
Couch or easy chair, Baron?” 


“The couch, if you please,” De Grost - 
replied, “a strong cigar, and a long whisky 
and soda. So! Now for our vigil.” 

The hours crawled away. Once De 
Grost sat up and listened. 

“Any rats about?” he inquired. 

The ambassador was indignant. 

“I have never heard of one in my lifé,” 
he answered. “This is quite a modern 
house.” 

De Grost drapped his yatch- -box and 
stooped to vick it up. 

“Any lights. on anywhere, except in 
this room?” he asked. 

“Certainly not,” Monsieur de Lamborne 
answered. “It is past 3 o’clock, and every 
one has gone to bed.” 


“The Baron rose and softly unbolted 
the door. The passage outside was in 
darkness. He liztened intentiy, for a 
moment, and returhed yawning, 

“One fancies. things,” he murmured, 
apelogetically. 
-- “For example?’

_. The Baron shook his head. 


“One mistakes,” he declared. 
nerves become over-sensitive.” 


- The tawih. troke and the awabeiing 
hum. of the-city grew louder and louder. 
De Grost rose and stretched himself. — 

“Your servants are moving about. ia 
the house,” he remarked. “I think that 
we might consider our vigil at an end.”

Every day of the 365 in the year 277 girls shut the doors of their parents’, homes. 
in the United States ana turn their backs on the p!aces. where for years thelr lives have 


been molded.

know how terribly they do yearn to go 
home—but they wi'l never get there. There 
may be gilded apartments for them—more 
likely, places of shame more drab than 
home—but not home or loved ones; and 
for many a sudden death and nameless 
burial. 

So it is a serious problem, this matter 
of a huhdred thousand future mothers of 
America leaving home and losing them- 
selves in the dangerous vortex of gay life 
before they are of age. And tu is a na- 
tional problem in every sense of the word, 
for every state and community is touched 
by it. 

“IT thougnt it was mostly these foreign- 
ers that run away and go baa,” a woman 
said to me the other day: 

But it isn’t. Seventy-five percent of the 
girls that are missing from homes in this 
country today are native. The other 25 
per cent are foreign born. 

“Why, how ridiculous!” another mother 
exclaimed when. I told her one day that her 
daughter might take it into her head to 
run away if the mother didn’t act in a more 
intelligent way with her. “Why, my daugh- 
ter is well provided for and she seems to be 
happy. Girls from the tenements may run 
away, but I hardly think that in the middle 
classes it really happens, do you?” 

I told her that she could not possibly 
have advanced a worse argument, for the 
missing girl problem is by no means a 
problem of the poorer classes, but rather 
of the great middle class. I have examined 
thousands of cases myself and have talked 


with scores of persons who have had wide- 
spread dealings with missing girls from all 


parts of the country, and I thin. it can be 
safely stated that 70 per cent of them come 
not from the poorer classes, but from the 
well furnished, comfortable American mid- 
dle class home. 

What kind of girls are these runaways? 

Two-thirds of them are small town girls 
seeking gayer, freer life in a larger city. 
The other third come from large cities and 
flee to other large cities. They are well 
dressed, stylish, smart. ‘They hays had 
money to spend, many of them too much 
money for their own good, and have sn- 


joyed too littlet companionship from their 
mothers and fathers. They are intelligent, 
bright, very tuick to learn. They have 
been educated, a large percentage of them 
at least in high school, for of all the 100,000 
girls missin; each year 90,000 are between 
the ages of fifteen and twenty. 

Not more than 20 per cent of- missing 
girls are from the poorer classes, while 
per cent, it is estimated, are from what 
might realy be called wealthy homes. 

“How many are delinquents?” is a fre- 
quent question. 

How I hate the word! I hate it for 1 
have seen a theusand injustices committed 
in its name by alleged social workers who 
are. quick to condemn a girl by classing 
her as abnormal. -There are some defec- 
tives, mentally and morally, of course, but 
the vast majority of them when they leave 
home are normal, healthy, typically Ameri- 


can girls looking for an opportunity to get 


some wholesome fun into lives probably 
dark for the lack of it. In a great many 
cases these girls are of striking person- 
ality, initiative-and business ability. ‘These 
find work and develop -ato capable busi- 


ness women in late years. 
As I shut my eyes sometimes and look 


back upon the kaleidescopic procession of 
girls who have streamed through my life 
in the .ast few . ears—missing girls, broken 
girls, embittered, hopeless ones, girls who 
wanted to die and girls who wanted still 
to live, I think most often of the romantic 
and pathetic case of Lady J—, a New Zea- 
land girl who fled to this country only re- 
cently and abandoned, in the leaving, a for- 
tune of at least three million dollars. How 
the heart of any right minded woman 
would go out for this girl, involved as she 
was in bitterness, misunderstanding and 
tragedy! “4 

I cannot tell you her name, for she is 
today a hard working respectable girl at 
the head of her own tea room in one of 
the biggest citics in the west, but her story, 
in many ways tyPica. of a hundred cases to 
be found in America every year, will {Ilus- 
trate my point.

official: ‘society, began to open her eyes to 
life’s meaning when she was sixteen. She 
had been pampered, as thousands of girls 


_in-this country are pampered, with every- 


thing her mother thought she ought to 
have. She was groomed for society life. 
They surrounded her with flunkeys and 
displayed her at balls for a whole season. 

‘You might think that she would have 
loved the tinsel and glitter of it al!, but 
there had been planted somehow in the 
girl’s heirt an urge for truth and worth 


._ that neither of the parents seemed to 
recognize as being of any importance. 


One time Lady J— wanted to read cer- 
tain books, not French novels, but big 
novels of life that dealt with truth and 
handled fundamental 
things without shame, but 
her parents in horror for- 
bade her. They could not 
see—and there are hun- 
dreds of parents in Ameri- 
can cities today who can- 
not see—that young girls 
of today want more and 
more to have independence 
of mind. 

A year passed. Lady 
J— leaped aheau in com- 
mon sense and ambition. 
She is the kind of girl you 
would call typically Ameri- 
can in her independence 
of manner now. But she 
was repressed at every 
turn. To hold her her pa- 
rents arranged a marriage 
to a man of their choice. 
They argued with her. 
They threatened her. They 
insulted her intelligence 
and treated her as the lit- 
tle girl of thirteen. They 
went on blindly without 
realizing that Lady J~— 
was no more the girl she 
had been than black was 
white. 

One night they came 
home to find a note pinned 
to her bed:

Here is a typical New York police report 
on a missing girl who left her home in 
Akron; wore clothes bought in Claveland. 


is a terrible, unsatisfied hunger for the little lux- 
uries of life. Until her money gave out Lady J— 
had been in the habit of getfing her hair dressed 
every week. When that became impossible it 
hurt this sensitive girl more than anything else. 
She had never done her own laundry, but now 
she had to. 

One night she was invited to dine with a 
smooth man who lived on his winnings from the 
races. She thought there would be little risk; 
she might get employment through his influence 
and be rid of the specter of actual want which 
was driving her out of her independent mind. 

She went to a bright cafe. Liquor was order- 
ed. She nearly lost her head. The road to de- 
struction was as clearly mapped out before her 
that night, she afterward told me, as if it had 
been planned by a malignant fate from the date 
of her birth. By the merest accident of the meet- 
ing of an old friend of her brother’s who happened 
to be in New York that night, she was rescued 
from a compromising situation and enabled to 
get back to a normal life. 

Taking a small job found for her in the cleri- 
cal department of an importing house, she man- 
aged to catch her balance. Later she went into 


business for herself and, today, a self-made wom- 


‘you think are straight girls to begin with?” 


+ 


an, she is leading a really. useful, successful life 
as proprietor of a tea room and cafeteria. 

Most girls have experjences like this,<but ar@ 
not so lucky. I am not a ¢ put it is ort 
truth to say that the ma y Of eifTs w wis 


_ American homes each year do. not return to ‘those 


-homes without some shamé oF ‘tragedy~: “which 
sears their lives for many yéars and often: drags 
them down to the very dregs of society. . The odds 
are against them; their chances of coming 


through the desperate gamble of running away, 
without ruin, are not even. 

There are hundreds of individual reasons for 
girls running away from American homes, but 
99 per cent of them leave home for one or more 
of eight reasons. Listed in the order ~of their 
frequency they are as follows 


1, Trouble with the family. 
2. Stage or movie lure. 


Pure wanderlust. 

A love match (aside from elopements). 

Necessity of earning monev 

A jilting or betrayal. 

Ambition to succeed in business. 

Abduction or lure by white slavers. 

‘How many of these girls that run away do 
I am 
often asked. 

The answer is: practically all of them. There 
can be no question of the innocence and honesty 
of 90 per cent or more of America’s runaway girls. 
It is after they run away that temptations beset 
them and that they succumb. 

And here is a very interesting fact. Of the 
girls who run away and get business jobs, a very 
small percentage ever go wrong. I have found 
very few such cases out of thousands of pitiful 
tragedies. “The girl whose mind is taken up with 
steady work will not fall a victim to the specious 
lures and -tricks of the nefarious vice ring repre- 
sentatives, infernally clever though they often 
are. It is the girl who does not know how to 
earn her living that is most seriously exposed .to 
this danger. 

And while the last mentioned cause is respon- 
sible for fewer girls leaving home than any other, 
you may be sure that it is one of the most hor- 
ribly influential factors in girls staying away 
from home. Of these lures and of the alarming 
extent of the white slave traffic I shall deal in a 


‘ later article.

ure of fancy that might vanish when the 
music ceased. 

As her hand swung out to the lower 
keys .Lanham’s eye caught the golden 
glint of the ring he had given her. His 
attention became fixed’ in watchifig for 
the flicker of it. For a while the music 
was lost upon him as his thoughts held 
to the empty significance of that little 
plain band on her finger. i 

Lanham was stirred as she had not 
stirred him before.’ lt was not the music 
—it was‘ not the mere charm of things 
sweet to the senses; somewhere at the 
source of these outward expressions fay 
something fine and beautiful yet undis- 
covered. It was the mystery of this hid- 
den something that moved him as one fs 
impelled to search out and know the flew- 
er that drifts unwonted perfume across rk 
patch. } | 


KF HELEN knew of the disturbance 

within Lanham she gave no sign out- 
wardly. Her attention was devoted large- 
ly to a daily period of study and reading 
with Don. Birds and flowers were game 
that these two hunted with little books 
during their hours In the saddle. Her 
evenings with Lanham passed in the same 
gracious, impersoral, friendly way that 
had marked their beginning.  .- 

But an event of the. following fall 
brought disturbance on her own account, 
filling her with vague uneasiness, It was 
a telegram from Barclay, of the New York 
office, stating that he was traveling east- 
ward from the west coast and woald stop 
off to sec Lanham about some affairs at 
the mines. 

As Helen Maitland of those days in the 
office she had been mildly anneyed by 
intermittent but persevering attentions of 
the complac@nt young secretary. As Helen 
Lanham she shrank from another meeting 
with peculiar aversion. And the thoaght 
that Barclay, with his inquisitive, smug 
littie analytical habits of mind, might pry 
under the surface relationship of her mar- 
riage to Lanham made her flush with 
ready resentment. ‘ 

Barclay was received by 
the cordiality of the frontier home. He 
accepted an invitation to remain “for a 
coupe of weeks and have*a try at the 
quail shooting. A camping trip - was 
- planned, and with a cook and two of tae 
punchers they made a party of seven for 
a ride into the hills. > 

Two things impressed Barclay imme- 
diately; one with open astonishment, and 
“the other with curious wonder. The first 
was the change that had been wrought in 
Helen—both in looks and in the interests 
to which she gave her attention. It was 
difficult for him to reconcile ner with the 
repressed professional woman of those 
other days. The rather striking food fea- 
tures she had before weré now awake with 
life and colorful beauty. It was a new ex- 
perience to hear her laughter. Wheat had 
arouse a speculative interest in him was 
Lanham’s strange bearing toward this 
woman he had sought so fmpetuously. The 
man’s attitude was almost that of avoid 
ance. What could have cooled his ardor 
was more than Barclay could imagine, in 
view of his own impressions of the young 
wife. 

At camp he found things the same way 
between them; the woman rriendly, at 
tentive, evenly sweet-tempered; the man 
quiet, courteous, but stoically undemon- 
strative and aloof. 

“That eastern guy,” remarked Bud to 
Al Lawley over the woodpile, “don’t stack 
up with me no higher than paint on a 
stone floor. I don’t like his damn white 
little. hands, an’ I don’t like the look of 
them button eyes o’ his when he looks 
at her.” 

“! kinda been feelin’ the Interest he’s 
takin’ in quail ain’t hardly up to huntin’ 
standard. An’ I been feelin’ the interest 
the Chief is takin’ in him ain’t hardly up 
to what he’d ought take in a stranger 
startin’ a brandin’ fire on his range.” 

“Meanin’?” asked Bud, gratingly. “I 
reckon Milt has got you about right-—-you 
Ain’t delicate, too much.” 

“Now, there yuh go! You an’ Milt an’ 
delicate! You make me ache in my 
thoughts. You do a heap of lookin’ an’ 
can’t see nothin’ fer the view. You got 
heads, an’ they’re just knobs to keep yub 
fréam slippin’ down through yer clothés. 
They cou'dn’t no one even think erooked 
about her in the sign language without I'd 
crawl him as quick as any one. I'm talk- 
in’ about men. Here’s the pore, spunky 
little crittur puttin’ it through out here 
alone, surrounded by a herd of men. An’ 
look at ’em! Those that ain’t Just sprung- 
kneed cow hands is either a stubborn, 
buck-jumpin’ son-of-a-gun that won't hitch 
or a creepin’ coyote slinkin’ up in the 
grass. Now, that mayn’t be delicate 
enough to suit yuh, but it’s facts.” 


N THE light of Al’s commentary, Bud 
watched the trend of affairs more close- 

It was not dimicult to see that the 
Chief acted queerly. He threw short, like 
a new rope, im the woman's presence. 
. There wasn't anything hearty about his 
companionship with her; he took a lot of 
troukle to see that she was comfortable, 
but he let it stop at that. “Well, doggone 
me!” Bud muttered,

But with patience Barclay awaited his

— were drawn away on various af- 
airs.

“You forget. We are not pretending.

“Was it ever entertained?” she. inter- 
rupted. 

“Doesn't it mean something to a wom- 
an to have an interest manifested?” he re- 
turned with warmth. “The

“So you weuld suggest my resigning?

‘well. For some reason that heaven only

“He is coming now,” she broke in. “See

[ tell him how you feel about it—or will 
you?” 

“No—for I suppose, aecording to west- 
ern ethics and in a glorified attitude of 
outraged egotism, he would start killing 
me with his six-shooter.”’ 

“You speak of. it as though it would 
be a sort of drawn out process. With a 
revolver his technique is a marvel of dash 
and precision,” 


SEMBLANCE of casual interest ha@ 
been re-established by the time Lan- 
ham came up to their resting place; but 
that night, when Lanham walked with her 
to her tent carrying a lantern, Helen saw 
Barclay’s eyes fixed upon them from the 
camp fire. She would have given—she 
knew not what—just then for a tender, 
jovial word of good-night under that man’s 
gaze. She could have begged on her knees 
to this constrained, inflexible man at her 
side to take her in his arms and kiss her 
lips that once. But Lanham gravely gave 
a look to the water bucket, the tent ropes, 
lifted the flap for her to enter, and with 
a low-spoken wish that she sleep well, he 
hung the lantern on the pole hook and 
strolled back to the fire. 
Tears of humiliation and helplessness 


.blurred her uncertain gaze as she tugged 


at her boot laces. The dark, shrewd eyes 
of the loiterer had seen one thing too 
clearly, with all of his lack of comprehen- 
sion; the incomplete fulfillm%nt—empti- 
ness—-where her life all but brimmed 
over in repletion. : 

On the third day after their homecom- 
ing, in the early afternoon, Al Lawley re- 
turned unexpectedly to the corrals to re- 
place a lamed horse. He found Barclay 
struggling with the lharngss of his hired 
team and making botched work of hitch- 
ing the restive ponies to his buckboard. 
The man's traveling bags and overcoat 
were piled back of the seat. He glanced 
up sharply at Lawley with a furtive ex- 
pression of dismay, but quickly covered 
his confusion by frankly asking for help. 
Lawley finished the hitching for him with- 
out comment, but watched Barclay covert- 
ly and with the alert suspicion which goes 
with instinctive dislike. 

Barclay lingered about the buckboard 
while the cowboy caught up another 
horse and threw on his saddle. With a 
feeling of relaxed tension he watched the 
man ride away. | 

Ia the big room Barclay found Helen

ANHAM was riding along the edge of 
a barranca when a hail from a rise 
on the opposite side bronght him facing 
about. He saw Lee Winton slithering fis 
7 ._ down the far bank, and. presenily 


» the foreman. scrambled up to his side. 


"phe gunny. stilinéss ofa lazy-atiernoen 
hung about the ranch house as Lanham 
-tede in. 


Barclay’s team stood by thé hitching 


rail. 
As he approaghed the door of the big 
room he could hejr Barclay’s voice slight- 
ly raised in some’sort of expostulation. 
Instinctively Lanham stopped to listen. 

“So you refuse to go with me:” he 
heard Barclay say. “You prefer to stand 
by the mockery of this bondage in iso- 
lation.” | 

Seeminely imcapable of grasping the 
situation beyond the door before him. 
Lanham stood in a momentary daze. 
Trivial impressions-—the contented cluck- 
ings of the hens under the umbrella tree 
and the distant creaking of the windmill 
veering to a change of the faint breeze— 
came prominently to his faltering senses. 
The pause, though brief, seemed minutes 
long and then he heard Barclay speak 
again in a low, impassioned tone. 

“Here you stand waiting in a great 
readiness to live and you hesitate to iet 
love touch the, kindling spark*’ There 
came the sounds of a few swift steps, the 
clatter of something falling from the table, 
and a stifled ery irom Helen. 

With a light bound Lanham crossed 
the veranda and thrust open the door. The 
change from the brilliant light outside to 
the cool dusk of the big room was abrupt, 
but he could see Barclay standing with 
his hands clasping Helen’s shoulders and 
her hands pressed against his chest— 
whether in resistance or responsiveness 
he could not tell. ° 

The swiftness of Lanham’s attack did 
not leave him thinking clearly until he 
found himself ont on the veranda with 
Barclay’s crumpled figure hanging tor- 
tured in the wrenching grasp of his hands. 
Futilely he wondered wlrat he was to do 
with the man. The. open door of the 
blacksmith shed caught his eye and, still 
without any definite intention before him, 
he walked the shaken creature to the 
little shop and thrust him inside. Closing 
the door upon him, he propped a short 
scantling under the broken basp, leaving 
the prisoner incapable of escape from the 
windowless shack. 

Of Barclay’s stand in the wretched 
matter Lanham was sufficiently aware. 
It remained for him to learn where Heien 
stood. He walked slowly back 4o the 
house with a strangely listless droop of 
shoulders and head. 

She was kneeling in one of the big 
leather chairs when he came in, leaning 
against the back of it and sobbing with 
her face in her arms. But hearing his 
step she sprang up to face him. 

“Teli me you do not think—” The 
words came with an impulsive cry, but. 
ended chokingly in a flood of humiliation. 
Lanham heard her speak, but he could 
not have told what it was she said. His 
thoughts were of himself—what he had 
done. what he must do now. He stood 
before her gazing down at his tightened 


ELEN put out her hand to check hin, 

but he did not see. 

“Back there,” he continued, “I honest- 
ly thought a condition had come to both 
of us where love would not count for 
happiness. And here I have been made 
wretched by love for you!” He glanced at 
her wistfully. “Every day has held its 
hours of misery because you were bound 
te me with that empty agreement and 
net. with love. And you-—-God knows how 
It have mangled your chances for happi- 
ness.” 

His words and manner were so utterly 
simple and so deyoid of outward ardor that 
the intensity of-his feeling and the open 
avowal in his confession were swept in 
upon Helen slowly. They came to aer 
with the submerged power of a wave 
that looms upon a swimmer, first as a 


‘ barely perceptible motion on the distant 


surface, then with the lifting thrust of 
mounting force until? with a heart-stop- 
ping dip and a mighty heave, there is a 
sudden ecstatic overwhelming. She stood 
swaying slightly toward him. Her eyes 
were closed with dampened lashes; her 
cheeks were flushed.and her livs- wcre 
parted. / 

‘f heard what he said at the last.” 
Lanham went on, as though steadied to 
carry the matter through. ‘And he is 
right. You are alone, and probably: sacri- 
fticing yourself to stand by an impossible 
compact.” Fer the first time since he 
started speaking he nerved himself to 
look at fe girl steadily, intently. “Do 
you wish to be free again? For God's 
sake, be frank with me! Do you care 
for him? Does his appeal—’ 

Quickly Helen stepped to him and laid 
her hand upon his. She disengaged his 


‘ hat, and, tossing it aside, gave him her 


other hand. | 

“f do not care-for him—except with 
loathing. Aud he ig wrong where you 
think- him right; but in another way he is 
right. I do stand waiting in a great read- 
iness to live.” Her hands tightened ever 
so Slightly. upon-:the.bread, firm palms 
that held them. “Hére! Now!” she added, 
with an exultant little break inher voice. 

Lanham seemed not to understand at 


all, so slow was his comprehension. 


“And you—my Intsband—are the only 
one that ever could touch the kindling 
spark. Yott have already. And I think 
it was right there on the hearth, that 
first morning, when you stood looking at 
me like ‘Afrizona.’”’ 

Even then he could not speak... But 
there was little need. Dropping her hands, 
he gently, wonderingly gathered her with- 
in his arms. She did not waver wgqder 
his gaze, and her face remained upturned 
to his as he lifted her to his lips. 

“Tl wonder,” he said, as they stood in 
the open doorway with their arms inter- 
twined, “if it wasn’t; after all, the kindling 
spark that sent me over that trail two 
thousand miles to find you!” 

“And I wonder,” Helen replied, 
the western art of reading signs 
greatly overrated!” 

A stealthy movement of the blacksmith 
shop door caught Lanham’s attention. The 
top, above the canted prop, swayed out 
in jerks as from impatient pressure from 
within. Then the lower corer bulged 
outward and an iron bar protruded aud 
groped uncertainly for a prying footing. 
Lanham smiled grimly. 

With one hand still holding Helen’s, 
he reached within the room and lifted a 
heavy Colt from a belt hanging over a 
peg. <A throw from his shoulder sent a 
single shot crashing into the scantling 
propped against the shed. There was a 
flurry of splinters and the door swung 
slowly open. Lanham returned the gun 
to its holster and stood wiiting. 


“if 
isn’t 


Erm period of inactive uncertainty 
<1. followed at the little shop. Then an 
open hand was extended beyond the door 
frame in a gesture that both declared and 


pleaded for amity. Barclay followed the 
hand out into the open with cautious and 
unatarming deliberation, and cast an anx- 
jous glance toward the house: 

A moment before he had pictured his 
departure as a hurried affair, sped with 
cunfire and spurts of dust about his 
horse’s flying heels, at least dignified in 
a way by the outraged husband’s concern. 

Hé stared in utter bewilderment. The 
scene presented by the low, comfortable 
ranch house with its lazy drift of smoke 
from the kitchen chimney, the hens con- 
tentedly squttering in the dust under the 
umbrella tree. and the man and woman 
serenely standing with clasped hands in 
the doorway, was staggeringly discon- 
certing. 

He saw Lanham lift a hand and wave 
negligently toward the buckbuard in a 
gesture of dismissal. and farewell—and 
the girl was looking up at the man beside 
her—not at him.

to give variety. Third. from the left is

Have you noticed the linings of the

capes especially have a most interesting 
detail carried out in their linings. There 
is a narrow band of flowered or brocaded 
ribbon marking or rather covering the 
joining of the lining.to the sides of the 
cape. This little streak of brilliancy is 
especially effective if the lining of the 
cape is of beige or mouse color or taupe, 
one of the neutral shades that are in 
vogue for linings at present. Sometimes 
the ribbon is one of those metallic ones 
that sparkle and glitter.

THE CONSTITUTION’S NOVEL-A-WEEK 


The Gift Supreme: 


CHAPTER L 


i. was stifling in the Gospel Mis- 
‘* sion. Bradford Chandler Vinton 
hesitated at the door. He drew 
back a moment from that saf- 
focating stench; then he pushed 
» | forward and slid into a seat be- 
| tween a negro sailor and a loose- 
lipped derelict with a cropped 
poll. Every scent and sight of the Gos- 
pel Mission repelled the aristocrat; but 
he had walked down the steps of his fa- 
ther’s house on Marlborough street, two 
hours ago, determined to explore the 
darker-by-paths of the city, bent on be- 
helding some of the phenomena of which 
hi; sociology course had told him, and 
not so seon would he cry quits. 
Vinton, of Marlborough street, sniffed 
uneasily, opened the stifling folds of bis 
great-coat, and fell te studying the hzu- 
ian elements of the picture. Strange, 
unfamiliar elements they were, to him; 
for the most part desperately bad. Rough 
types of men surrounded him, raveled 
threads of the warp and woof of life’s 
fabric; men of divers nations, four or 
five of them black. Sailors and rousta- 
bouts were there, out-o’-works and won't 
works, hoboes, panhandlers and roughs; 
some with prisen records, others deserv- 
ing them; some just unfortunate down- 
and-outers, seeking a little respite from 


the cold. 

Vinton entering—a 
woman not like thess other women; a 
young woman, wholesome, clear-eyed, 
smiling; a woman whose mere presence 
seemed to purify the rank and stifling 
atmosphere. Her smile was not of the 
lips alone, but also of the eyes. Vinton 
gct an impression ef trim competence 
from the frost-rudded cheeks, the little 
toque of squirrel fur, the long, brown 
corduroy coat, tight-buttomed to the firm 
chin. With revivine fnterest he sat up 
and frankly stared at her. 5 

Glad tb see you, Sister Alden!” greet- 
el the evangelist, shaking her hand. 
“Afraid you wasn't comin’—it’s so nippin’ 
cold, an’ all” 

He led her- up the aisle, umder the 
vagu> lights. Her presence, in the sti- 
‘ling reek, seemed like that of fresh-cut 
roses in a hospital ward. Smiling still, 
she nodded to the outcasts as she went, 
and many blurred eyes brightened, many 
brutalized faces lighted at her greeting. 

So they reached the little platform. 
There the girl teok off her hat and coat, 
disclosing masses of tawny hair parted 
on one side and drawn away toward the 
back of her finely molded neck. She was 
plainly dressed in a white shirtwaist and 
» black serge skirt that showed satisfy- 
ing lines. Around her throat Vinton saw 
| silver chain with a little anchor hang- 


beheld a woman 


ine therefrom. 

This much is noted as she left her hat 
and coat on one of the drab chairs and 
sat down. Then Mr. Crawley, the mis- 
stonary, beckoned to massive, hard-faced 
woman with several chins. 

“Mrs. Wesson, will you play for us?” 
asked he. 

Nodding, Mrs. Wesson murmured that 
she would, and. heavily took her place at 
‘th® organ. A stir of animation passed 
through the audience. The social wreck- 
age pulled ifSelf together, in anticipation 
of music and exhortation. The labor of 
salvation was about to begin. 

The hymn soon finished, Vinton sighed 
with relief. The missionary had the floor. 
(‘lanping his hands, he cried loudly: 

“Well, boys, you’re fierce on the sing- 
in’. but now-forget it, an’ listen to me, 
an’—l’ll “hand you some right dope on 
glory.” 
. Vinton paid little heed. He was study- 
ing the face of Miss Alden, who sat 
quietly, smiling a little as she listened 
to the shouts of the evangelist. Vinton 
thowght he had never beheld a finer face 
that hers, or heard a worse delivery than 
the missionary’s. But this audience, com- 
fortably warm, had no mind to be critical. 
Murmurs of approval rose on the air, 
mingled with a few wavering cries of 
“Amen!” 

Again the hoarse, harsh voices mingled 
with the girl’s pure tones as another hymn 
filled the dark and stifling mission. 

Vinton could tolerate no more. Sud- 
denly he felt an overwhelming desire to 
be gone. Unable longer to endure the 
nlace, he got up, shoved past the negro 
sailor beside him, who was reeking and 
moaning with religious exaltation and 
reached the aisle. 

The outer air, even of that foul court, 
seemed deliciously fresh and pure by 
contrast with the choking fetor of the 
mission. Buttoning his overcoat to his 
chin, Vinton wandered away through the 
litter toward the garish lights of Han- 
over street. 

He stopped short. A sudden, keen 
desire had been born in him—a desire 
to know this type of woman, so whoily 
different from any with whom he had 
ever come in contact; to analyze her 


motives; to sound the sources of her mis- 
sion to life’s disinherited. 


He found the alleyway again, turned 
down it, and reached the door of the 
place. Outside, undetermined what to 
do, he paused. He wanted to enter, yet 
he dared not. Instead, he remained there 
peering in through a grimy window. 

He decided to wait—to wait, if it took 
all night. Now that they had come te the 
saving part of the performance, i couldn't 
last much lomger AH at omce he heard 
footsteps coming down the alley.. He 
knew that they were hers. Such quick, 
business-like, brisk footsteps gould be 
those of nobody else. 

Turning, with rather a queer sensation 
round his heart, he beheld her; and for 
the first time in his well-poised and even- 
tenored life he felt a real embarrassment. 
As he drew near the corner he raised his

Irom his pocket he drew the affidavit and held it out to her. “Now look at this.” 


hat, and plunged in with: 

“Miss Alden, may I ask 
thing?” 

The girl stopped, puzzled. She looked 
up at hfm with steady eyes—he saw by 
the light of the arc above that they were 
an honest gray—and answered: 

“Me? Ask me something?" 

“Yes, if you don’t mind answering.” Sub- 
consciously he sensed the pleasing quality 
of her voice, the calm self-reliance of her 
gaze, “Tell me, why on earth do you come 
down to a—a place like this, and—and—” 


“Why do you?” she countered, smiling 
a little. “What is there in a North End 
mission to interest a man like you?” 


’ “You saw me there?” he asked. 
“Of course! What did you come for?” 


“Oh, curiosity, I suppose,” he answer- 
ed, puzzled at being thus catchized. She 
seemed to have become the questioner, 
not he. “Curiosity, partly. It’s all so 
new to me—dquite a foreign world. I’ve 
been studying about these things,” he 
continued, his embarrassment swiftly 
melting under her frank and open interest. 
“It occurred to me that I should like to 
see for myself something of—of the other 
half you know. Perhaps I shall write—” 

“An article?” she took the word from 
him. “They all do that!” Her yoice be- 
trayed just a tinge of bitterness. “But, 
dear me,” she went on, “we can’t stand 


you sonie- 


out here on the street corner, discussing — 


things. I'm chilly, after that stifling air; 
and it’s late, too. It'll be half past 11 
before I get home now, and l’ve got to 
be at work early tomorrow morning.” 


She moved slowly away. He drifted 
along beside her, down Hanover street, 
hardly knowing why he went or how he 
dared go, but thoroughly unwilling to say 


.goodby. ~~ 


“Work,” he queried. “You work some- 
where—at other things than this?” 

Her laugh showed fine teeth, as she 
answered, 

“Why, of course!” 

“Which way do you go now?” 

“East Boston tunnel.” 

“And you walk down there alone?” 
said Vinton wonderingly. “Through all 
this?” He swept his hand at the dark 
potentialities of evil that seemed to 
menace the district. “You walk there 


often, alone?” 
“Why shouldn't 1?” Her tome showed 
that_ she hardly understeed his question. 
SKE deed 


was a woman different 


* 


from any type he had ever known? Puz- 
zled, he walked with her in silence, find- 
ing no word to say. Trivialities, he real- 
ized, would be worse than absurd: and 
for the life of him he could lay tongue 
to no appropriate abstraction. 

“Beg pardon, Migs Alden, thut—you 
interest me. Will you grant me one fa- 
vor?” 

“Why yes! What is it?” 

“Will you lunch with me tomorrow, 
and tell me more about your work among 
the down-and-outers?’ 

“Yes,” she finally answered, “I'll go, 
on one condition.” 

“What's the condition?” 

“That you'll let me pay for 
lunch.” 

“Your own? Oh, all righi! Allow me 
to present my card.” 


my own 


He handed her the card, finely en- : 


graved with “Bradford Chandler Vinton.” 
She slipped it into her little mesh bag 
without comment, and without even 
glancing at it. 

“Where shall I meet you?” asked Vin- 
ton, half ashamed. He felt repulsion at 
the fleeting thought that perhaps she 
might mistake him for some vulgar 
masher, but he would not retreat. 

“Come to the sail-loft, a little before 
noon,” she answered. “Cordwain & Mc- 
Cutcheon’s on Commercial street. Therc’s 
where I work, you know—one of the 
places where I work.”

CHAPTER IL 


What 


— sensation of mingled pleasure 
his 

on uneasiness quite beyond powers 

A trifle worried, he went down to 


breakfast. His father. EKtiot Vinton, was 


gone to his State street offices, to the 
big shipping business which for so many 
years had maintained Bradford in luxury, 
had put him through Harvard and given 
him his master’s degree, sent him to 
Heidelberg for a year, and now was 
enabling him to spend another yeur in 
trying to develop what he believed to be 
a latent talent for writing. Bradford felt 
glad that the old gentleman was not there 
to eatechize him. 


His mother—an old-school aristocrat, a 
Tiliotaon, of the Newberry street Tillot- 
sons—hovered about him while he ate 
in the breakfast room. Nervously she 
supervised the maid, solicitous lest her 
boy’s toast and eggs and cocoa should not 
be exactly suited te his taste. Vinton 
tolerated this surveillance, through bh: bit, 
though secretly it annoyed him. He 
evaded his mother’s anxious questions 
about his late hours, and with relief came 
to the end of an uncomfortable meal. 

It was close to a quarter of 12 as Vin- 
ton—having passed through the tumultu- 
ous clutter of Faneuil Hal market, and 
threaded his’ way amid the muck and 
turmoil of Commercial street—caught 
sight of Cordwain & McCutcheon’s sign, 
high up on the flank of a vast, dour, gran- 
ite pile that loomed like Gibraltar through 
the mist. 

He saw a long, low room, noisy and 
redolent of tarred rope—a pleasant smell, 
it seemed, and clean. Everywhere can- 
vas—rolls, bales, mountains of canvas; 
seas of canvas, billowing over a vast, 
littered floor, the boards of which were 
pitted with infinitudes of tiny pumectures, 

Nervously Bradford glanced about hin, 
hoping to discover the girl, yet: fearing 
to; afraid lest he might find her at some . 
harsh and menial task. Near him a map 
in white overalls, down on his hands and 
knees with a big pencil, was scrawling 
cabalistic marks on breadths of fabric 
pegged to the floor with awls-: 

“Can you tell me,” he inquired of this 
individual, “where I can see Miss Alden?” 

“Office!” grunted the man, nodding 

A moment later he had found Miss 
toward a far corner of the loft. 

Alden. 

She nodded pleasantly at him as he 
stood there in the doorway of the office, 
but did not rise from the paper-strewn 
desk where she was sitting, or offer him 
her hand. 

“I had some difficulty ™ finding -you,” 
he ventured, oddly confused by her eyes. 
“am I too early?” 

“Oh, no,” she assured him, smiling. 
‘T’'ve just got to seal and stamp these 
bills; then I’ll be through. “Won't you 
sit down?” 

Soon the last envélope was ready. The 
girl stacked them all together and thrust 
them into a well-worn leather bag. 

“All right now,” said she. “I’m through 
here for the day.” 

She stood up, took down her coat from 
a nail, and with his help slipped into it. 
Then she put on her little hat. Both hat 
and coat, he noted, were the same that 
he had seen at the mission. Had she, 
then, no others? 

“Well, let’s be going,” said Miss Alden, 
looking up at him with those steady gray 
eyes.s ‘ | 

“All -right,” he answered. “I'm glad 
you haven't anything more to do today, 
for now we can—” 
~ “You don’t understand, at all,’ she 
interrupted. “I’m only through here! I’ve 
got to be at the theater at half-past one, 
so we haven’t any time to lose.” f 

She picked up her bag and moved to- 
ward the door. 

“Allow me,” said Vinton, taking the 
bag from her. “What theater?’ 

“Jordan’s Olympia, in East Boston,” 
she answered, as they reached the stairs 
and started down. “I told you I had four 
jobs, didn’t 1? Well, that’s one of them.” 

“And you mean to tell me you work here

s’< mornings 2 week, and then—do that, 
‘+ : 

“Of course!” she assented. “Now please 
let’s be going. We've got to hurry if we're 
going to have any lunch.” ? 

As they reached the oozy, steaming street, 
and started along the sidewalk together, Vin- 
ton put another query: 

“Teli me, Miss Alden, what—what else do 
you do?” 

“Well, I eat once in a while. Where shall 
we go?” 

He laughed, and named an up-town hotel. 
She shook her head in decisive negation. 

“You know I cannot afford that, Mr. Vinton 
yaid she. “Remember, this is fifty-fifty. t 
know a dandy little place down Atlantic ave. 
Come on.” 

The little restaurant turned out to be 
rather preposterous, Vinton thought. The 
table-cloths of the “tables for ladies” im- 
plored one not to“inspect them too closely. 
A heterogeneous throng crowded the limited 
space, Vinton felt distressed at dining there 
on a small steak and French fried potatoes, 
served on stone china and with only paper 
napkins; but the girl ate with good appetite, 


and a made him forget his unease.” 
e 


He admired her healthy attack on the food, 
and her obviously eupeptie constitution. 
Every minute he found himself adfnjring her 
more and more, for one reason and another. 

“Tell me,” he took up his questioning again 
et the dried-apple pie and chicory-coffee 
stage of the meal, “what other work do you 
do? Do you teach school, and give music 
lessons, and write stories?” 

“Oh, no, nothing like that. Just plain easy 
little jobs that I get a chance to attend to 
when I’m off from the theater—in the after- 
noon sometimes, and sometimes after it 
closes. I keep books for a doctor and for 
a hardware store in East Boston. 
have to go two or three times a week.” 

“But,” he exclaimed, “that means you 
sometimes work all day long, from morning 
till late at night! And you have the theater 
every Sunday, too?” : 

“Only Sunday nights,” she corrected. “I 
have nearly all day Sunday for my piano 
and my shorthand study, and my sewing and 
other things.” ' 

“Good Lord!” ejaculated Vinton, aghast. 


(“What are you—a human dynamo?” 


. gret; but with

*. 


“No, just a girl.” : 

“But your health, Miss Alden—how. on 
earth do you stand it? And how long have 
you been at it, anyhow? I’m pretty strong, 
but. such a racket would finish me in six 
months.” 

“Well, it hasn’t finished me yet,” she 
laughed, “and I’ve been at it more than three 
years. Nothing hurts me. I’m digustingly 
healthy. There’s nothing romantic and wil- 
lowy and clinging about me. We’re all heal- 
thy in our family—always have been. Father 
and mother would probably have lived to 
be very, very old; but they were both 
drowned about three and a half years ago 
when the Edmeta C, was wrecked on Rum 
Reef.” Vinton looked his commiseration. 
“The best legacy they left me, and the only 
one, was health. I don’t seem to mind any- 
thing. It’s mighty lucky, too!” 

“Yes, that’s right. But tell me—” 

She glanced at the clock, and interrupted 
him by rising hastily. 

“I’ve got to be going,” she said. “You can 
waik as far as the tunnel with*me, if you 
care to.” . 

They paid their checks and departed. Vin- 
ton felt a singular shame at letting a woman 
in his conrpany put down money for a meal; 
but he realized the futility of any objection, 
and held his peace. As he walked beside her, 
carrying her book-laden bag, he resumed his 
questioning. 

“Tell me, Miss Ald2n, how about that mis- 
sion stunt of yours? How in the world do 
you ever find time or strength to sing for 
those lamentable wrecks?” 

“Oh, I make it, somehow or other. Once 
a week I get off a little early from the theater.” 

“Yes, but do you really. believe in that 
crude blasphemy ?’’ 

She eyed him thoughtfully, then shook her 


ead. 

“No,” she answered, “but I think it helps 
them, just the same. I know at least two 
sailors I’ve rescued that way, and I’ve braced 
up several others, You can sometimes sing 
decency into a man’s heart when you can’t 
talk it or punish it in. I came to that conclu- 
sion during a few months of experience as 
a hospital nurse, a little while before my 
father died. Father was always interested 
in helping broken mariners. He was a sea- 
captain, you know. That’s one reason why 
I do the mission work—in memory of him. 
It’s the only memorial I can afferd. Well, 
here we are again,” she added as they 
,reached the tunnel station. “Thank you 
very, very much for coming down to see me, 
and good-by!” 

‘‘Good-by,” said he with singular regret. 

Once more he watched her pass through 
the turnstile and disappear. Then, more pen- 
sive than ever, he returned to his own world 
in the Back Bay. 

During the month that followed, Bradford 
Vinton saw the girl more and more often; 
and at each parting he found his wonder 
and his admiration deepening. Her name, 
he discovered, was Sylvia. Sylvia Alden. The 


name pleased him-immeasurably. It seemed . 


to fit her with fine precision, connoting gen- 
tleness, yet strength. 

He came to have the habit of spending 
much time with her, time that his anxious 
mother thought was in research work 
for the book he now planned writing. 

Twice or thrice he visited her home, and 
once he took supper there—a little flat on an 
obscure street, where she lived with an aunt 
and an elder brother. 

There was, Sylvia told him, a younger 
brother, Howard, a ten-year-old boy, away at 
school somewhere. This mattered nothing. 
Bradford’s whole interest now was centered 
just in Sylvia. 

He found that the girl, in her own home, 
was always gentle, always calm, an excellent 
cook, a skilled needlewoman—she made some 
ef her own dresses and all her own hats— 
— BR ec" soo yg : better than she 
Pp ayed. aguely ’ en with greater 
clarity, he came to feel that here was an 
ideal wife, a perfect mother. 

Thus, not with a blind’ and mad infatua- 
tion, bred of the 7 Ay youth; not with 
the fevered passion sweeps so many te 
the prison-pit of life-long disillusion and re- 
a sane and wholesome under- 
standing of the problems involved, Bradford 
came to love her.

save He never took her te plays, te 
concerts or dances; they never went motor- 
ing together; they had none of the frivolous 
diversions immemorially dear to lovers. What 
time had Sylvia for amusements? 

It was one Sunday afternoon toward the 
end of March that Vinton asked Sylvia to 
marry him. He asked her in the little parlor 
of her E. Boston flat. 

“Sylvia,” said Vinton, laying down the 
mission report she had asked him to read, 
“we'll just let these statistics go till later. 
I want to ask you something.” 

“About the work?” 

“No; about you. 

“What do you want to know about me, 
Bradford?” 

“More than you’ve ever volunteered,” he an- 
swered. 

“Well, if you really want to know, we are 
English, with a little mixture of Scotch blood 
—Highland Scotch. Father’s family came 
originally from York, and mothe from 
Caithness. I’ve already told you that father 
was a Gloucester sea captain. Mother was a 
farmer’s daughter.” 

ere couldn’t be a stronger stock than 
yours, Sylvia. Joined to mine; it could ac- 
complish anything!” 

“Don’t Bradford,” answered Sylvia. “You 
mustn’t talk that way!” ; 

“Why not?” demanded Vinton. He came 
over to her, as she sat by the window, laid a 
hand on her shoulder, and looked down earn- 
estly into her face. “Why not?’ 

“Because we mustn’t go astray like that. 
It could spell nothing but trouble sooner or 
later. You’re what you are, and I’m what I 
am, and a whole world lies between us.” 

“We can annihilate the world!” 

“No, Bradford,” the girl objected; “and 
even if we could, we’ mustn’t. Your whole 
outlook on life is different from mine. And 


there are practical difficulties of all sorts in ~ 


the way. Your family would never consent, 
for one thing. All your friends and associ- 
ates—” 

“Dismiss that part of it from your mind. 
What else stands in the way?” 

“My work,” she answered simply, 
work at the mission.” 

“f can share it!” ! 

“I don’t know about that, Bradford. You 
think so now, bet after a while it would wear 
on you and disillusion you. You’re not miss 
sionary stuff, and I—well, my whole heart is 
wrapped up in that sort of thing. I don’t 
mean in a religious sense, you understand, 
but in a wider way. I may not be doing 
those poor wretches much good, but at least 
}'m doing something!” 

She stood up and faced him, took his hand 
in both of hers and smiled again—that quiet, 
inscrutable smile. 

“And you won’t let me help you?” he de- 
manded, almest fiercely, drawing her to- 
ward him. 

“You can help me-—best by—by being a 
good, loyal friend, Bradford, and by not in- 
troducing—complications.” 

“I can help you best by making you my 
wife!” 

“Oh, not that, not that!” 

: She sought to repel him, but he would. not 
isten. 

“Yes, just that!” he persisted, his voice 
shaking. “You need me, Sylvia, and I need 
you.” 

A great eagerness swept his soul. Pas- 
sionately he drew her to his arms and kissed 
her; but still she put his face away from 
hers with a resisting hand. 

“Why do you do that, Sylvia?” he asked. 
“Don’t you love me?” 

“Oh, yes, yes, yes! 
the beginning—and that’s 
wouldnt’ let you see eit, 
couldn’t.—” ? 

“You can now,” said he, as she smiled up 
at him a little tremulously. « 
~ He took her face in both his hands. All 
her opposition melted suddenly in the fire 
of his passion. Trembling, as Francesca and 
Paola trembled at the moment of their sub-

“lime caress, the man’s mouth and the wom- 


an’s met and clung in ardent kisses. 

“Sylvia!” he whispered, with the girl’s 
breath hot upon his lips. “Sylvia!” 

The girl’s arms encircled Bradford. 

“Hold me tight, tight, tight!” she whis- 
pered tremulously. “I want to be all yours!” 

His answer was another kiss that drew 
their souls into one sonl. And in that kiss 
they sounded the depths and stood upon the 
heights of joy. 

Bradford returned home that night su- 

remely happy in the sense of loving and be- 
ing loved. 


As he hung his coat and hat on the rack 
in the hall he heard his father’s voice call- 
ing him from the library. 

inton sensed a certain harshness in his 
father’s tone, which at best was never gen- 
tle. Even through the buoyancy of his mood 
uneasy premonitions of trouble forced them- 
selves upon him. A chill passed through the 
low of his exultation as he turned, walked 
toon the hallway and entered the library. 

The old shipping master red a moment 
at his son through gold-rimmed pince-nez. 
Then, frowning, he opened a drawer in the 
desk and took out a folded newspaper which 
showed an item marked with blue pencil. 

“Read that!” 

Twice through Bradford read the mali- 
cious bit of gossip, while his face began to 
burn. Then gazing with defiant eyes at his 
father, he dro + som the paper on the desk. 
““Well?” suddenly demanded Eliot. “You 
have nothing to say?” 

“Nothing at all,” answered Bradford. 
“Have you anything?” ’ 

“As a Vinton I cannot and will not have 
any aspersions cast on our name. You have 
done your mother and me a great wrong. 
Now, Bradf you must make amends.” 

“Amends? hat do you mean?” 

“You must dismiss this creature. You 
must break with her at once, permanently 
and for all time. You must pay her what- 
ever she demands, if necessary to free your- 
self from her grip. I will settle the bill. 
And after that—” 

“Father, do you know what you’re saying?” 
exelaimed Bradford, suddenly standing up. 
He gripped the edge of the leaned over 
it and peered into the old gentleman’s face. 
“Do yeu realize you're asking an impossi- 


bility?” 
How so?” 


“An impossibility? 
“Because this girl has just promised to 


_ share in one of my ships—the 


engaged—engaged to be: married. De you an- 
oerWhat ?” demanded the men oll 
ed the old gentle with 


growing stupefaction. “You, a Vinton, in- 
tend te marry a—woman of the streets? No, 
no, no, impossible!” 

Bradford’s face grew a dull red. 

“That’s a gratuitous insult,” he retorted, 
“for the best and purest girl I ever knew!” 

“What is the name of this persoi?” 

“Sylvia Alden.” : 

“Ah, Sylvia Alden! And she lives some- 
eee in the exclusive purlieus of the North 


“She lives in East Beston, in a very good 
and pleasant home of her own.” : 
Briefly he recounted Sylvia’s many activi- 
ties, while Eliot listened-with indifference. 
At mention of the sail-loft, however, the old 
shipmaster leaned forward with frowning 


brows. 

“What's that? She works for Cordwain & 
MeCutcheon ?” he demanded. 
Was it 


was her father’s name? 


n: 


“Yes, it was,” answered Bradford, aston- 


ished. “You didn’t know him, did you?” 

“To my sorrow, yes,” said Eliot bitterly. 
“Very much indeed to my sorrow! This caps 
the climax, Bradford. Not only do you want 
te marry a working woman, but you choose 
the daughter of one of my fermer employees 
—and such an employee! Naturally, she never 
teld you about it.” 

“No,” admitted Bradford. 

“I do not wonder! | . 
in concealing so damaging a fact. Let this 
be a gauge of her whole character.” 

“What damaging fact?” Bradford demand- 
ed, peering keenly at his father, as if to pen- 
etrate some ruse. “What’s damaging about 
her father having worked for you? 

“He cheated me out of some four thousand 
dollars, that is all!” said Eliot, a not of tri- 
umph in his voice. 

“He cheated you? How so?” demanded 
the young man, his mind in confusion. 
“Sylvia’s father cheated you?” 


The old ghipmaster nodded in affirmation. —— 


“It ig susceptible of proof,” he said. “It is 
a matter of record; you need not take my 
word for it, though my word has never yet 
needed any corroboration. David Alden was 
one of my captains, in the coastwise trade. 
He had ambitions; looked above his proper 
station in life. Wanted to become a capital- 
ist, or something of that sort.” 

“What then?” 

“Well, he saved his wages, and’ bought a 
Edmeta, a six- 
masted schooner, launched at Bath in 1899. 
Three years ago last November he lost the 
schooner—piled her up on Rum reef in a 
snow storm. He and his wife, who was 
aboard, went down; but not the girl—more’s 
the pity!” 

“See here, father—” 

“Keep still! He had paid me only twelve 
hundred dollars. There remained forty-three 
hundred due me. Insurance was underwritten 
by two companies. He had let his share run 
out. The details are too complicated to give 
now; but when the thing was settled I had 
lost a little more than four thousand.” 

“And how much does Sylvia owe you now?” 
Bradford demanded pointblank, as a sudden 
understanding dawned on him. “How much 
has she paid you already, by the sweat of her 
brow? You, you worth your half million or 
so, I believe?” 

“What do you mean, sir?” demanded the 
shipmaster with sudden heat. Intolerant in 
many things, he was most keenly so in regard 
to any criticism of his business methods. 
“Have you the effrentery to stand there and 
attack my honest dealings with a lawful 
debtor?” 

“Bah!” retorted Bradford angrily. “You 
and youre ‘honest dealings’ make my flesh 
creep! Do you know what you’re doing to 
that girl? nderstand the inhuman slavery 
you’re keeping her in?’ 

“That is gnough, sir!’ exclaimed Eliot Vin- 

He drew a doilar-bill from his pocket, held 
it up in front of his father’s face, and 
laughed bitterly. 

“See that?” he demanded. “Well, every 
dollar I’ve had from you, just like this one, 
has contained some pennies sweated out of 
her! A part of every idle dollar I’ve been 
spending the past three years—no matter 
how small a part—has come from that girl’s 
infernal slavery to you! If I needed any- 
thing more te open my eyes, I’ve got it now.” 
'“T repudiate you,” said the old man icily 
and without a quiver in his voice. “I disown 
you. You are not a Vinten!” 

“Oh, all right! If I can’t be a Vinton, as 
you understand it, I can at least try to be 
aman, If I don’t marry Sylvia, and help 
pay this infamous debt to you—a debt which 
any man with a real heart would have for- 
given her long ago—may I forfeit the title!” 

Eliot Vinten stood up and faced his son. 
He had become hard inflexible and arrogant. 
— face, paler than ever, was set in harsh 

ines. 

“You understand, of course, that if you 
leave my house with this intention I shall 
disinherit you?” 

“IT understand.” 

“And that all our relations cease from that 
moment?” ' 

“Ves.” 

“Very well, sir, there is no more to say. 
From now on you must depend absolutely 
on yourself. I shall be nsible for 
nothing, either socially or financially; nor 
will your mother. She bears my name and 
shares my sentiments.” 

Bradford bit his lip till it purpled. Then 
nodding, he replied: 

‘ a think we've said quite enough. Good- 
ye ’ 

Trembling and weak-kneed, but with an ab- 
solutely unshakable determination, he re- 
turned to his study. There he packed a suit- 
case with linen, pajamas and a few other 
necessary articles. 

Then, all his preparations made, he cast a 
final, lingering, farewell glance about the fa- 
miliar room. 

“Good-bye!” said he. “I’ve been a parasite 
and bloodsucker long enough! I’ve been a 
weakling long enough. It’s time I tried to 
be a man!” 

CHAP. IV—The Shyster and His Breed. 


In the austere house of Vinton that morn- . 


ing’s breakfast was a sad and cheerless 
mockery. ni before, at half-past 11 
o’clock, the old shipping master’s wife had 
returned from g protracted meeting of the 
Society for the Amelioration of Poverty, to 
find her husband in a white rage, and Brad- 
ford gone. There had been a harsh scene, 
in which Vinton had refused to concede a

single point. Neither one had

IRVING STAGG— INVESTIGATIONS 


announced an inconspicueus sign painted on 
a marble slab at the of one of the 
older and meaner of these buildings. Here 
Eliot Vinton entered. 2 
was not now a practicing lawyer, 
but was what was known in cant speech as a 
“law ghost.” Some years before he had been 
expelled from the Massachusetts bar, the 
against his name in the nearby court- 
house read “Bad moral character.” Neveh- 
theless, he still did business in more or 
less devious ways. 7 ; 

“Mr. Vinton, I believe,” said he, nodding 
at his visitor with an oleaginous smile. 

Vinton put his top hat en the cleanest part 
of the desk, drew up a proffered chair and 
sat down. For a moment he eyed Stag with 
a kind of chill ne rg 4 that seemed to 
shrink from contact with the presence of the 
man he perforce must use; then, forcing 
himself to speak, he answered the shyster’s 
question. 

“I have a matter of some importance for 
you to handle. Before we discuss it you 
must understand the necessity of absolute 
discretion.” 

Stagg nodded, leaned back in his chair and 
scratched his double chin, whith for two or 
three days had noc made the acquaintance 
of the razer. 

“I’m your man!” he assented. “Not a 
whisper gets by me.” 

“Very well,” continued Vinten. “You are 
to investigate a certain person at onec, and 
give me all the facts.” 

“Hmm!” grunted the law-ghost, 
shrewdly. His intuitions had not 
him. “What name, please?” 

“Sylvia Alden.” 

“Miss or Mrs.?” 

“Unmarried—at present.” 

“I see!” commented Stagg, nodding again. 
“And you want me to ‘get’ ber, so that—” 

“I want all the facts concerning her;. noth- 
ing but the facts. Your method of obtaining 
facts are of no importance to me, and I do 
not wish to know of them. They concern 
only your self. All that interests me is the 
result. I direct you to investigate her ful- 
ly and report to me inside of a week.” 

“Nothing easier,” affirmed Stagg, tapping 
on the desk with a paper cutter. “It’s all a 
se of dollars and cents, like everything 
else.” 


“I will give you an honorarium of $2,000 
if you perform your work satisfactorily.” 

“All right, sir!” answered Stagg, his eyes 
glinting avidly. “I’m safe in guaranteeing 
satisfaction. -I know all this mission gang. 
If she travels with that crowd—” 

“Kindly make no assumptions,” Vinton 
ifiterrupted coldly. “I want nothing but the 
truth. Your investigation must be full, 
comprehensive and final. In addition te your 
honorarium, I will allow you $500 for ex- 
penses.” 

Only with difficulty could the law-ghost 
dissemble the joy that possessed his soul. 
Vinton drew out his wallet, counted 
out $500 in bills and laid them on the desk. 
Stagg eyed the money greedily, but let it lie 
untouched. : , 

He bowed his client from the offica; then, 
gloating, returned to his desk. With cager 
fingers he counted the money, found the 
amount correct, and thrust the bills into his 
pocketbook. 


Chuckling to himself, he walked heavily to 
the door of a private inner room and 
opened it. | 

Within this room sat a man, hs feet on a 
table, his chair sagging back against the 
wall. This man, of indeterminate age, but 
probably not over twenty-five, though his 
mottled, drink-reddened, pimply face and his 
buloous nose were those of an old toper— 
was idly picking his teeth with a brassy 
safety pin and reading the Police Gazette. 
He turned bleafy eyes towards Stage, sniffed 
noisily, rubbed his nose with the back cf 
— hand, and emitted a single menosy}ia- 

le: 

“Job?” 

“Job is right, Meiny.” 

“What's the lay, old gent?” 

“Investigation of a lady’s charactcr,” 
grinned the shyster, sitting down on the edge 
of the desk and swinging a fat leg. 

“Put her on the bum, huh?” . 

“Surest thing you know! Old man Vinton, 
you savvy—he’s the fish we’ve landed this 
time—isn’t offering me a fee of two 
thousand bucks, plus a hundred expense 
money, to dig into the past of Nellie, the 
Beautiful Shop Girl, and give her a clean 
bill of health; especially when by putting 
two and two together, it’s a cinch his son is 
bugs about her, and has blown his he:ne 
and nest on account of her.” 

With an evil look the shyster produced the 
expense money. 

mpassively the puffy-faced one shoved into 
his pocket the bilis his father counted out to 
him. Then, lighting a cigarette, he inhaled 
a lungful of smoke, leaned back in his chair, 
put his feet on the desk and leered with evi! 
eyes at his progenitor. 

“Now, old gent,” said he, “we'll get down 
to tacks an’ frame this thing rignt. Who is 
the skirt, an’ where, an’ what? Hand m2 the 
dope straight an’ Pll guarantee to produce 
results. Let’s have it dad!” 


Evening—-the- evening of the third day. 

It was late after the closing of the metion- 
picture theater. Sylvia and Bradford, sitting 
in the little parlor of the East Boston flat, 
were anxiously taking counsel of each other. 
Disappointment and some touch of depr’va- 
tion had already come to him; misfortune to 
her. Bradford looked a trifle thinner. One 
could now see just a hint of his cheek boncs. 
and something of his fresh color had faded.

home in Marlborough st. 

Also, his unpressed suit had lost its tailor-

“So you didn’t sell anything today,” the 
girl was saying. “I wonder what's the mai:cr

could report fer them—that is, anybody who 
what news is and how to write.” 
“That's more or less a myth,” answered

to think, Sylvia.” He shook his head, puz- 
zlied and discouraged. “Something’s wrong 
somewhere. Surely it can’t be that the gov- 
ernor is stabbing me in the back?” 

The girl shrugged her shoulders and smiled 
addly. 

“I hate to say anything against him, Brad-

“How did it happen?” 
“Oh, it was simple enough, and it looks all 
Tight on the surface; but—however, no mat- 
ter about that. Mr, Cordwain just told me 
that he was-very sorry, but my work wasn’t 
satisfactory—that was a lie; of course, for 
I’ve been there three years, and he’s never 
had a complaint to make—and then he told 
me he’d have to let me go on Saturday. Of 
course he gave me a little something—a few 
dollars extra; but what are a. few dollars, 
with all this expense here, and my brother's 
board to pay—the little fellew’s, you know, 
who's with my aunt—and with that big debt? 
Well—” 

“What a rotten shame!” ejaculated Brad- 


ford hotly. Then, as understanding dawned: 


“You don’t suppose the governor—” 
“Do you?” 
_“T don’t know,

“Never mind, Bradford,” she tried to calm 
him, smiling. “It’s only one more little ob- : 
stacle to face. -I’ll find somethirg else to do. - 


I’ve still got my other jobs, anyhow. I’m go- 
ing on just the same as before, mission and

CHAPTER V—Eliot Vinton Plays His Trump 

On the morning of the twelfth day after 
Eligt Vinton’s interview with Irwin Stagg, 
the shyster summoned a messenger-boy and 
sent a communication of the very’ highest 
import. Reaching the old gentleman just as 


he was arriving at his office,. the messarec - 


engulfed him in such a. flood of joy that he 
forgot his rigorous principles: to the extent 
of giving the boy a dime. 


read the note four or five times laughing 
with malice and exultation. : 
Finally, more excited than ke ever. fe- 
membered having been, he departed on foot 
for Pemberton square. On the way he 
stopped at the Interstate Trust Company 


and drew two thousand dollars in hundred 
“ 


dollar bills. 

The note said. 

My Dear Mr. Vinton: 

I take great pleasure in informing you that 
at last my investigators Wave succecded in 
obtaining facts of vital importance. They 
are conclusive and irrefutable. 
more. 

I hesitate about sending you a written 
report, lest it might miscarry; but if you 
will do m2 the honor of calling, at your 
comvenience, I shall be very giad.to put into 
your hands an affidavit of the very greatest 


value. 
Sincerely Yours,: i. 8. 


When Vinton reached the office on Pem- 
berton square the law ghost grected him 
with a jubilation he could not conceal. Al- 
ready he felt the touch of the shipmaster’s 
fee-—and fecs were the breath of life to 
Stage. 

He offered his hand to his aristocratic 
client, who in this glad moment unbent suf- 
ficiently to take it. Then, when both men 
were seated, he unlocked his desk drawer, 
tock out a long manila envelope, carcfully 
sealed, and handed it over with a leer of tri- 
umph. 

“There, sir; read that,” said he. Facts, 
sir, as I have told you before, arc my strong 
point!” 

‘ Vinton had already ripped the envclope 
with an unsteady forefinger. His eyes, blink- 
ing with eagerness, leaped along the lines of 
the typewritten affidavit that he held in his 
shaking hands. Twice through hé read the 
documert, then peered at Stagg from beneath 
his heavy, wrinkling eyebrows, and once 
more studied the paper, as if to let its full 
significance penetrate his mind. | 

“How’s that, sir?” demanded the shyster, 
smiling unpleasantly. “Couldn’t beat it, 
could you?” et 

“Extraordinary!.” Vinton exclaimed,. “In- 
credible! You are quite positive it is cor- 
rect?” | 

“Absolutely positive!” 

“Can it all be proved?” 

“It can never be disproved, Mr.. Vinton.” 

“Hmm! There can be. no possible loop- 
hole of evasion?» No suspicion of a doubt?” 

“I’m sure eve ing will be satisfactorily 
edjusted now, without the least difficulty,” 
declared Stagg with a smirk. 

“No doubt,” answered Vinton coldly. “I 
need know only one thing more. When and 
where can I see this—this person, with the 
absolute. assurance that my son will neither 
be present nor arrive inepportunely to inter- 
rupt the interview?” . 

“Well, you'll catch her about 5 o'clock this 
afternoon,” said the law-ghost, as he 
scratched his chin, the bristles making an 
audible crepitation. 

“And where?” 

_- “At her house, No. 69 Oldham st., East Bos- 
ton. Your son won’t be there, that’s positive. 
That job he’s got with Holcomb Brothers 
don’t let him out till six. Five p. m. will 
do, it all right.” 

That afternoon at a quarter past five, the 
Vinton limousine, having crossed to East 
Boston by ferry, deposited its owner at the 
door of the apartment house containing Syl- 
via’s little flat. With scornful aversion Eliot 
surveyed the street and building labciled 
“Aden,” and avaited admission with signs 
of a nervousness unusual to him. 


In a minute or two the door-catch clicked. 
With his every look betraying the most sov- 
ercign disdain of such surroundings, Eliot 
mounted two flights ef stairs, found the door 
of Sylvia’s home, and rang again. The door 
opened, and he found himself face to face 
with the womanewhom he detested more than 
he had ever realized he could detest anything 
on earth. 

“Miss Alden, I believe?” 

“Yes,” she answered, “Won’t you come in. 
Mr. Vinton?” 

Startled, he blinked at her, then with un- 
berding stiffness marched into the little par- 
lor. e sniffed frigid!y as he looked abecut 
him and saw a photograph of Bradford on

books, and queried: 

“May I ask how you know my name? Our 
dealings have so far been indireet. I do not 
believe. I have ever had occasion to meet you 
personally.” 

The girl smiled again, and stood there with 
A np joined in front of her as she re- 

ied: 

“Oh, Bradford has told me so much about 
you, for one thing. And then, too, I’ve 
rather been expecting you, you see!” 

‘“Expecting me? How so?” 

“Why, it was inevitable that you would 
come. I’m glad you’re here. I’m very, very 
willing to answer you everything. Won't you 
sit down?” 

“Thank you, no. 
brief. You understand, of course, that I 
have positively forbidden my son to continue 
his present course of action?” - 


“And that I shall entirely disinherit him éf 
he persists_in his intentions? That he will 
suffer ostracism and social ruin?’ 

- “[ understand 
him,” she said calmly. 


Eliot Vinton flushed_slightly as she ignored ; 


his-threat of social punishment. 

*“Tam not disposed to argue with you, Miss 
Aiden. I wish merely to ask you to renounce 
an affair which spelis disaster for my son.” 

“You lové him, then, so much?” she queried, 
her eyes seeming somehow to penetrate him, 
to appraise and judge him disquietingly. 

“IT do,” answered Eliot, sensing a certain 
discomfort in her presence, 

“That's odd!” she comménted, as if half to 
herself. “I can quite understand that, fecling 
as you do-about my father and about mé, you 
should try to persecute me and throw me out 
of *employment; but loving your son as you 
say .you do, I can not understand how you 
could have closed the’ doors of his home 
against him and driven him to—” 

“That will do!” interrupted the shipmas- 
ter. “I am not here to be questioned, an- 

I am* here for ene pur- 
pose, and one alone.” 

“Of course you mean by that—” 

“You understand perfectly well what I 
mean,~ Miss Alden. 
you in the name of his mother and in my 
own name, but only for Bradford’s own sake. 
If you will give him up, and force him to 
abandon his mad folly, yon can save him from 
déstruction. He can then return to his home, 
his prospects, and ail that life will mean to 
him in hig. proper environment. What is 
more, I am willing to make you certain offers 
of very material advantage.” 

“Offers?” she repeated after him, frownin 
a little, with that«straight line between he 
brows which always: showed when she was 


puzzled.- “What offers, Mr. Vinton? What de. 


you mean?” 

“Why just this,” he ansered, speaking with 
precise care. “If you will do as I wish, I 
will, in the first place, obtain for you a posi- 
tion very much easier and more lucrative 
than any you now hold. In the second place, 
I will remit the debt which—” 

“No more, please, Mr. Vinton!” she inter- 
rupted suddenly. She faced iiim ag a nun 


might face some brute who had struck deep © 


into her soul with a gross insult. “Please go, 
now! I don’t want to forget myself and say 
anything that might hurt Bradford later on.” 


“Go?” demanded the shipmaster with as- | 


tonishment. “You mean—you refuse—” 


She made no answer, but only pointed ~ 


toward the door. ~° 
“Very/’ weil!” said he, his voice shaking 
with malicious triumph. “I have dene my 


whole duty by you, and far more than my } 


duty. I have given you your opportunity and 
you have refused it.” From his pocket he 
drew the affidavit and held it out to her. “Now 
look at this!” 

Troubled, she advanced her hand, ¢ook the 
paper and gazed at it with wondering eyes. 
She réad a line or two, looked up at the old 
shipmaster, who stood there with a sneer on 
his lips, and then again peered at .the type- 
written words. 

As if dazed, she secmed to be trying to 
comprehend. Then, quite suddenly, she 
caught her breath. 

“So, then, it is the truth, ch?” gibed Vin- 
ton, nodding. “You remember it now, do 
you?” 

The paper slid from her hand and fell to 
the floor. Sylvia steod there booking down 
at it for a second. Then she made three or 
four steps to the threadbare sofa and sank 
down there, with her head bent forward. 

“Well, what do you. say? demanded the 
shipmaster. “What do you say to that?” 

“I—I surrender him—to- you,” she whis- 
pered, the spoken words fading off to noth- 
ing. ‘“ ” : 

Something seemed to break within her 
heart and soul. Before this horrible and 
overpowering onslaught Sylvia’s vital -forces 
gave way. Her head fell back, all the 
strength went out of her body, and she sank 
down before Eliot Vinton ‘in a dead faint. 

He picked up the affidavit and thrust it

seemed to spurn the girl in her supreme 
abandon of defeat. Then, with a sneering 
laugh of triumph, he left her lying there, 
and so departed from that house of desola- 
tion. 


CHAPTER VI—The Disappearance. 


Bradford Vinton stood peering with some 
indecision through the window of one of the 
more prosperous-looking Hanover st. pawn- 
shops. The gold letters on this window an- 
nounced that Israel Adelstein, in addition to 
his broking business, paid highest cash prices 
for jewelry. After some hesitation, and with 
a giance up and down the street which be- 
trayed his lack of self-possession—for one’s 
first visit to a pawnshop is always disconcert- 
ing—Bradford Vinton mustered his nerve, 
pushed the door, and entered Adelstein’s do- 


—_—— 


- Main. 


Adelstein came shuffling from some ob- 


- secure baek room, in slippered feet and with 


gold spectacles on brow. 
“Vell, sir? Vot can I do for you?” 
Bradford drew a heavy ring from his left 
hand and laid it on a square of black velvet 
which lay atop the show case. 


“How much.can you give me for that?” 
asked he, with a certain hesitation which be- 
spoke his innocence of pawnshop dickerings, 

Israel shook his wise old head, 

“I cannot buy it,” said he. “Every jeweler 
in Boston knows this ring. It is a famous 
heirloom listed as an art treasure. So, 
you_see, I cannot buy.” 

Bradford flushed suddenly, understanding 
the old Jew’s thought. 

“On, it’s mine, all right enough!” he ex- 
claimed naively. “I---I’m working now, But 
it’s my ring See here.

letter or two, addressed to him. Still Adel- 
stein hesitated. Bradford showed his init- 
ials in the corner of a handkerchief, also in 
the sweatband of his hat. All this cumula- 
tive evidence seemed to convince the pawn- 
broker. He pondered a moment; with knit 
brows; then nodded assent. 

“That,” said he,” is different.” His eyes nar- 
rowed inscrutably. “I gif you two hundred 
dollars.” 

“No,” answered Bradford, shaking his head. 
“That's not enough. I’m not going to dicker 
with you, but I'll tell you that this cameo is 
a hundred and fifty years old, and its mar- 
ket value is more than a thousand dollars. If 
I wanted to take it to any of the big jewelers 
up on West st., or Tremont—” 

He reached for the ring, and slipped it 
back on his finger. Adelstcin reflected, sore 
distressed. He had a shrewd suspicion that 
Vinton pere would give him much more than 
a thousand to rescue the cameo from dis- 
play in a Hanover st. pawnshop.window—a 
display which he counted on making, and on 


- bringing to the notice of the shipmaster by 


devious means. 


“Let me see it vunce more,” said he, and~ 


again took the gem in his deft fingers. He 
put a magnifying glass in his eye, studied the 
carving with -deliberation, satisfied himself 
that this was the very ring he belived it to 


be, and then said. with an air of finality: ©. 


“Four hundred!” «. 

““T’ll meet you half way,” answered Brad- 
ford.~ “Five hundred takes it—and you’ve 
got the bargain of your life!* 

“Israel sighed deeply. 

“It vill ruin me,” he began, “but—” 


““All right, give’ it back!” exclaimed Brad- 


ford reaching for tke gem. 
“But I vill give it, to accommodate you,” 
the Jew concluded. He turned, fumbled on his 


desk, found and made out a bill of sale, and ~ 
shoved this over the showcase to Bradford, © 


together with a pen. “Sign here,” directed 
pointing at a dotted line. 


he 
With reiuctance, even at that stage of 


the bargaining, Adelstein opened his safe and * 


produced the money. A minute later Brad- 
ford’s lean pocketbook bulged with a plump- 
ness now unusual, while the Vinton heirloom 
of all heirlooms had passed into’ the pawn- 
broker’s keeping. 

“Then, while Adelstein peered after him ap- 
praisingly, in joy at kas! ¢ a windfall of for- 
twhe, Bradford turned ond left the shop, with 
a singular exuitation in his cye. Purpose- 
fully he strode toward Scollay square, where 
he could reach a tunnel connection, making 
his way with almost boyish eagerness among 
the crowding pedestrians. : 

Half a block from the pawnshop he came 
upon a flower booth. 
bought a- modest little bunch of pinks—well 
he knew Sylvia would accept no more. 

‘Dusk had begun to soften the harsher out- 
lines of the strest where Sylvia lived, and 
the are-lights had begun to glow, casting 
their pale illumimation through the green 
dust of buds and tiny leaves on the few 
trees along that sordid thoroughfare, as 
Bradford, with his gift of flowers, drew near 
the girl’s little flat. 


Breathless and with fast-beating heart, he. 


ran up the stairs of the apartment house to 
her door. Then, his face, transfigured by 
hope, by faith and by previsionings of joy, 
he rang her bell and stood there waiting 
for the kiss he knew would greet him. 

The door opened, and Sylvia’s aunt, vague 
in the dim-lit hall, stood there before him. 


In spite of his confused emotions, Bradford 


noticed something of the distress and alarm 
that looked out at him from her pale eyes. 

“Sylvia?” he demanded, in a kind of gulp. 

Miss Alden stared at him, in keener fear. 

“She’s gone!” 

“Gone? Gone where?” 

“My laws, I wish I knew!” Miss Alden 
answered tremulously, beginning to cry. 
“When I come in from prayer-meeting, half 
an hour ago, I found she’d packed up a 
suitcase and gone, that’s all!” 

She fumbled in the pocket of her apron, 
drew forth a crumpled bit of paper, and 
held it out to Bradford. He snatched it, 
in his eagerness. 

Under the dim gaslight in the hall, the 
girl’s writing seemed to dance and quiver 
strangely as he read. 

Dearest Aunt Margaret:

me to stay here any longer. Don’t worry 
about me—please, please don’t! Everything

not to say hostile; so Bradford wasted lit-

his leave. ; 

The only other place where he could pos- 
sibly hope to find her, or to get even the 
faintest clew as to her whereabouts, was 
the gospel mission in Boggs Court. To the 
mission, therefore, he now hurried, panic- 
stricken and with a heavy, unreasoning ter- 
ror in his soul. 

Sylvia was not there; had not been there

CHAP. Vil—War. 


Of an evening toward the middle of the 
month two men were lounging oyer their 
drinks in the back room of Cronin’s Place, 
not three minutes’ walk from the squalor of 
North square. 

“Come again twice on the Scotch there, 
Mike!” commanded the larger of the twain 
and raised a beckoning finger at the waiter. 

“Well, Dannie, we put it across, after all, 
didn’t we? No penny ante game neither, but 
some O. K. financial operation. If we can 
keep it goin’, we'll be money-numb in no 
time. I thought for a while, there, they had 
us on thé run; but we got away with it, after 
all. As a game, can you beat it?” 

Rat-face shook his head and reached for a 
cigarette. 

“It was bull luck, Meiny,” he commented. 
“Your old gent just happened to get things 
fixed right, didn’t he, eh? That’s what’s goin’ 
to let us by—notin’ else. If he hadn’t had 
the goods on that doctor, we never could ha’

level. They’re sayin’ he’s got a bunch comin’ 
his way already—newsies, bums, down-an’- 
outers—but no panhandlin’ goes, not for a 
minute. That’s all I know, Meiny—search 
me!” 

With a grunt of extreme displeasure 
Meiny- started across the narrow strect to- 
ward the door of the Little Haven. 

“What—what you goin’ to do?” queried - 
Dan, timidly following his irate chief. “What 
you up to now,” eh?” 

“Goin’ to pipe off this guy and his joint,” 
answered Meiny. “An’ if I don’t like him, or 
he gives me any lip, I’ll have Muges Rafferty 
knock his block off an’ put the place on the 
fritz, that’s what!” 


Know any--: 


With a truculent air he pushed open the ° 


door and entered, tagged by the anxious and 
deprecatory Dopy Dan. 

An unusual profusion of light, cast by big 
oil lamps with tin reflectors hanging from 
the ceiling, also the presence of tobacco 
smoke, also an entire absence of platform, 
benches and Bible texts, convinced Selon at 
first glance that Dan’s information had been 
correct, and that the Little Haven was no 
ordinary “gospel dump.” Corroborative cvi- 
dence of this fact came from the clink of 
dishes and the smell of hot coffee and good 


S$ 


cooking that drifted in through a swinging . 


door at the rear of the main room. 
Everything there, every aspect of the new 

venture, connoted helpfulness and decency; 

and to Meiny these qualities were as flame 


to a toad. No signs here of rum, graft or’ 
exhortation. Meiny made a wry facc us he * 


turned to Dan. 3 
“Humph!” he growled in his puffed throat, 
“If I’d known a sissy place like this was 
goin’ to be started round here, I’d of crabved ° 
it at the kick-off!” - 


He advanced toward-the table. One or two . 


men peered at him inquiringly. A boy looked 
up, too—a wizened little boy, thin-faced and 
milk-pale, but washed even behind the flaps 


- of his big ears, which constitutes the ex- 


treme limit. of juvenile lustration. Against 
the arm of his chair rested crutches. Meiny ' 


shortened, was held in an iron brace, as he 
demanded: 

“Say, kid, where’s the main guy of this 
joint?” 

“Mr. “Brown?” asked the boy 
treble. 

“IT don’t know his monniker. 
push, I mean.” 

“In there.” 


in a thin

The head 


The boy pointed a frail, bloodless finger — 


at the swinging door whence issued sounds 
and scents of eating. Without even the civ- 
ility of thanks, Meiny growled: “Come on, 
Dan!” and thrust through’ the door, followed 
by his blinking henchman. 

He issued into a fair-sized, low-studded, 
cheerfully lighted room, carpeted, like the 
first, with fresh sawdust, and very clean. 
Six tables, covered with white oilcloth, stood 
at the right. Opposite them, a counter held 
a steaming coffee urn, pleasant of odor, and 
other accessories of a lunchroom. 

A dozen men or so were busy at the tables 
with knife, fork and spoon. A couple stood 
at the counter, waiting for their orders. Be- 
hind the counter a solid-shouldered man in 
a duck coat, his back towards the scowling 
Meiny, was calling throvgh a hole in the 
wall: 

“Make it twé6 on the beef stew!” 

Then Meiny saw his face. 

, Cheese sake!” whispered he, his jaw drop- 
ping and a look of blank astonishment over- 
spreading his putty features. “For the love 
of Mikel Him?” |

A New Year’s 


EFORE taking up our talk for to- 
day it may not be out of place to 
spend a moment on the beginning 
of the new year. 

New Year’s eve and New Year’s 
day have, from time immemorial, 
been singled out from all the 

rest of the year for special observance. 
The machinery of Father Time is so ex- 
quisitely adjusted that we pass from the 
old year to the-new without a joit 
or jar. Only the hands of the clock 
furnish evidence of the change that takes 
place when a year is added to the days 


jthat are gone and a new year opens with- 


its unstained pages. 


At such a time people are wont to gath- 
er—the mirthfui for rollicking pleasures 


and the serious for prayer. The differ- 


ence between the two groups is to some: 


extent a matter of-age. The young eager- 
ly greet the days as they come, for ali of 
life is before them. ~ Opportunity is the 


great word that they see written in glow- 


ing letters on the dawn—opportunity to 


be improved. Hope, rather than memory,- 


holds sway and-their joy finds expression 
in youthful ways. 


1 older ones, in proportion to their 


age, recall opportunities unimproved,. 


days wasted, and possibly, errors that 
have left deep scars. There is also a 
feeling of solicitude that misleading paths 
may be shunned and that the coming 
year may contain more.to make retrospec- 
tion satisfying. 


While the gay make merry until the 
midnight hour calls forth a glad welcome 
to the new year, the sober, increasingly 
impressed with the finiteness of man and 
the infinite power and wisdom and love 
of God, look to the Heavenly Father as 
the only source from which enlighten- 
ment can come. They appeal for guidance 
during every waking moment of the com- 
ing year. 


Experience has taught them how i1:a- 
possible it is to judge which moment will 
be richest in fruitage; they have learned 
how impossible it is.to estimate the con- 
sequences ofa singlelact. Trivial events 
sometimes become epoch making, while 
things seemingly great dwindle into in- 
significance. Happy are those who early 
learn their own need of prayer, and 
through prayer open their hearts to di- 
vine suggestion. 

And New Year’s Day is, more than any 
other day, the time for salutation and 
expressions of good will. It is a. gloomy 
soul that does not respond:on this day 
to the summons of friendship. If there 
is any warmth in the heart, it radiates 
in the greetings that are at thefr flood 
on New Year’s Day. 

“ormerly John Barleycorn reaped his 
sociel harvest on the first day of the 
year. He offered his services as caterer 
to those who opened their homes to New 
Year guests and many a young man dis- 
played a volubility that increased uniil 
it was lost in indistinctness, the number 
of his calls being limited only by his 
powor of locomotion. 

If the Eighteenth Amendment has les- 
sened for some the attractions of New 
Year’s Day, it has for a still larger mul- 
titude decreased the unpleasant reflec- 
tions that come with the closing days 
of the year and made it possible for 
more families to face the future without 
fear. 

It will be easier also to keep the new 
resolutions that this amniversary calis 
forth. 

UR talks for the new year take us 

back to the Old Testament and we 
shall have an opportunity to trace God’s 
methods of dealing with a “chosen peo- 
ple.” We shall consider from week to 
week characters great and small, 
noble and ignoble, and learn how 
froin the beginning it has been true 
that the “wages of sin is death.” 
Nowhere except in the Bible do we find 
portrayed so vividly aad so abundantly 
the just retributions that follow wrong 
doing; nowhere are the rewards of right- 
eousness shown to be more swift and 


more sure. 


We begin with Rehoboam, the only son 
of Solomon, and we wonder how one s0 
wise could have a son so foolish—so far 
as known the sole contribution which 
he and a thousand wives and concubines 
made to the perpetuation of the race. 


Rehoboam had all the advantages that 
a youth of his day could have. 
er’s reign was conspicuous because of its 
prosperity; wealth poured in upon his 
kingdom, and the heir-apparent had 
everything that the worldly wise think 
necessary for a favorable environment. 
But the son taught the lesson so frequent- 
ly repeated before and since, that neither 
a great family name, nor learning, nor 
wealth can insure wisdom. 


When Solomon entered upon: his reign 
he prayed, “Give therefore thy servant

THE REVOLT OF THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL 
TEXT OF TODAY’S BIBLE TALK ‘BY MR. asides ste 


(I Kings 12:12 
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as 
, Come to me again the third day. 
And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s 


And spake to them after the counsel of the young » men, 
father made vour yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father, 
also chastiseth you with w hips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 

Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was 
from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, 
by Abijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of } 

So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,.the 
people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither 
have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; 
see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed ‘unto their tents, 

But as fer-the children of Israel w itis dwelt in’the cities. of Juda, 


Then King: Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and 
‘all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.. Therefore King Rehoboam 
made speed to get up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. *: . 
And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that- Jeroboain “was. come 
sent and called him unto the congregation, and madé him 
el: there was none that followed the house of David, but 


-20.) 


saying, My 


which the Lord spake 
ebat.- 


to your. tents, O Israel: now 


an understanding heart to judge thy peo- 
ple, that I may discern between good 
and bag.” But nothing was farther from 
the son’s heart than the father’s prayer. He 


-came to the throne as his father’s suc- 


cessor without a protest, and by one act 
of folly lost ten of the twelve tribes over 
which his father ruled. 


H* first error was to ignofe good ad- 
vice. We read that Rehoboam “con- 
sulted: with the old men, that stood before 
Solcmon, his father while yet he lived,” 


and said “How'do ye advise that I may 
answer this people?” 

Jeroboam, who represented the ten 
tribes of the children of Israel, had pre- 
sented a petition, saying, “Thy father 
made our yoke grievous: now therefore 
make thou the grievous service of thy 
father, and his heavy yoke which he put 
uven ws, lighter, and we will serve thee.” 

Whether the yoke was really grievous 
or whether their complaint was without 
just grounds is not the material question. 
The people made complaint and the old 
men, whom Rehoboam consulted first, ad- 
vised Rehoboam, saying: “If thou wilt be a 
servant unto this people this day, and 
wilt serve them, and answer them, and 
speak good words to them, then they 
will be thy servants forever.” 

This was sound counsel. The king was 
advised to serve thé people and to speak 
gocd words to them upon the assurance 
that the people would then be his serv- 
ants. 

But’ such advice did not please the 
young king. He forsook the counsel 
of the old men and “consulted with the 


young men that were grown up with him,” 
and they, influenced possibly by the im- 
petuous spirit of youth, but more likely 
by a desire to please Rehoboam, gave 
him advice just the opposite of that 
given by the old men. 


They not only advised him to refuse 


the people’s petiticn, but they suggested 
insolent words which could not fail to 
provoke resentment, if not rebellion. 


Instead of promising relief, or even 
expressing a willingness to investigate 
the cause of. complaint, 
Rehcboam to threaten heavier burdens. 
“My little finger shall be thicker than my 
father’s loins” was the illustration which 
was used to. measure the increase that 
he would impose upon them. Instead of 
inquiring whether his father’s yoke was 
burdensome, he was told to admit—pos- 
sinly wilcout justification — that -his 
father’s yoke was heavy and say that he 
would add to it. 

This was the advice of the young men, 
and to make his defiance of the people 
more contemptuous the young men sug- 
gested another simile: “My father hath 
chastised you with whips, but I will chas- 
tise you with scorpions.” 

How these young men advisers must 
have giggled and winked at each other 
as they urged the young king to impu- 
dence. Wit is often more alluring than 
common sense; with some smartness 
counts more than simple truta. 


Rehoboanmi was easily led when the ap- 
peal was made to his pride and self-im- 
portance. He doubtless chuckled at the 
brilliancy of the retort suggested to him 
and nodded his head as if to say, “We will 


they: -advised 


nip this familiarity in the bud: wena 
teach these people not to bother a king 
with protests and entreaties. Any en- 
couragement would lead-to further de- 
mands.” 


T is the old story of autocracy. The 

methods of arbitrary government are 
not new; they are the natural outcrop- 
pings when power is not controlled by 
love. 

Pharaoh exercised them when he com- 
pelled the children of Israel to make 


bricks without straw as a punishment. 
When they. asked for tinie to sacrifice to 
their ' God, Pharaoh replied that it was 
because they were idle that they asked 
for time to sacrifice, and- he commanded 
“Let there more work be. laid. upon the 
men.” And the emancipation of the chil- 
dren of Israe} followed. , 


It was in the same spirit that Rehoboam, 


unmindful of the lessons of the past, dealt 
with his people, so that the ten tribes of 
Israel revolted’ and made Jehoboam their 
king; and it ‘is interesting to note that 
Bismarck, in his story of his own life, 
criticized: the emperor’s’ military. com- 
mander for not-being-more harsh in deal- 
ing with an uprising in 1848,- He said: 


“On Nov. 10, Wrangel, having marched 


in at. the head of his troops, negotiated 
with the civil guard and persuaded them 
to withdraw voluntarily. “I considered 
that a political mistake. If there had 
only bcen the slightest skirmish, Berlin 
would have been captured, not by capitula- 
tion, but by foree, and then the political 
position of the government would have 
keen quite different.” 


The moral that we draw from this first 


lesson of the new year comes at a very 
appropriate time. The spirit of Pharaoh 
and Rehoboam has too often been the 
spirit of the world—not only the spirit 
of those in control of governments, but 
the spirit of those who have dominated 
in all walks of life. 


One cannot travel through the lands 


where so-called inferior people are held 
as subjo¢ts by a superior “force without 
hearing echoes of this autocratic philos- 
ophy. ‘“The people will not appreciate any 
favors shown them.” “They will con- 
strue kindness as weakness.” “They 
must be controlled by fear.” Peace by 
terrorism has been a costly fallacy from 
which the world is now turning. 
Rehobdam gives us the antithesis of the 


spirit of bretherhood, and his failure can 
be cited today in support of the wisdom 
of the opposite policy—the brotherhood 
which Christ taught. “Thou shalt love 
thy neigphor as thyself” is the remedy— 
the only remedy—for all the ills: which 
afflict society, whether they come from 
misgovernment or from friction bctwcen 
different elements of society. 

As war, like a boil, indicates poison in 


the blood, so the domestic boils that ap- 
pear on the body politic indicate a poison 
that must be eradicated. Christ is the 
Great Physician; He purifies the blood 
and brings to individual, to community, 
to state, to nation, and to the world that 
peace for which all hearts yearn.

as desired in the irames. 


When calendars or almanacs were 
first. issued they were the luxury of the 
few. The masses resorted to mnemonic 
rhymes. Two doggerels were common: 

“Thirty days hath September, 

April. June and November.” 

This is still well known, but the other, 
which told the days with which the 


months begin is almost forgotten. It was 
supplied by the “Three Men of Dover’— 


“At Dover dwell George Brown, esquire, 
Good Christopher Finch and David Friar.” 

Each of the twelve words stands for 
a month. The first word stands for Jan- 
uary and starts with “A.” In 1922 the first 
day is Sunday, thus “A” stands for Sun- 
day, so the tenth word, “and,” which also 
starts with “a” signifies that next Octo- 
ber, tenth month, also starts with Sun- 
day. The second word stands for Febru- 
ary, and begins with “D” which stands 
for Wednesday (“A” for Sunday, “B” for 


Monday, “C” for Tuesday, “D” for Wed- 
nesday, etc.). Thus it will be seen that 
it is necessary to know or remember only 
the first day of each year, unless it Is 
leap year, in which case those months 
after March will be represented by the 
preceding letter in_the series, 

This quaint old couplet suggested the 
illustration of the hearty squire; the 
“good” laboring man, who was not digni- 
fied with the title “Mr.” and the pious 
friar.

Get Shoes to Fit Your 
Feet; Don’t Pinch 
Them 


F you are born with big feet, no 
shoe on earth is going to make 
them look small. Is it not fool- 
ish to imagine that tight shoes 

will make our fect look small? 

.. if your shoes are too tight 
it will stop circulation, make 
your face spotted and give it 
a queer, wrinkled expression. 

Of course, there is the other extreme, 
and a shoe that is too large for you will 
rub your foot and raise blisters. 


The sensible woman keeps on shop- 
ping for shoes until she finds a particular 
last that fits the shape of her foot—then 
she keeps on buying that particular last. 


It is not economy to have only one 
pair of shees. You should wear a pair 
of shoes two or three days, take them off, 
place on shoe trees, meanwhile wearing 
another pair. This will rest your feet 
and save your shoes. 

Also you should never wear a pair 


of stockings more than two days, and it 
is preferable to change them every day. 
This is helpful to the feet and will in- 
crease the life of your stockings by many, 
many months. 

If you want a simple remedy for tired, 
aching feet, just rub lemon juice on the 
soles of your feet every night. It will 
act as a tonic and be a wonderful help. 
If your feet are dry and feel rough to 
the hand you ought to use ordinary vase- 
line. Rub it in, not just on. The yel- 
low vaseline\is better. This will keep 
your feet soft and pliable. 


O not confuse callous spéts on the 

feet with corns. Do not go after the 
callous spots with a knife, but soak the 
fect in hot water, in which a liberal piece 
or ordinary washing soda has been dis- 
solved, then rub the spots with a piece 
of pumice stone, and if you rub hard 
enough the callous will come off. Try 
this once or twice a week. Bunions and 
eorns are quite another thing. Bunions, 
almost without exception, come from 
shoes that do not fit, and the thing to 
do is to buy shoes that are long and 
wide enough and for the time being only 
those with flat heels. You can sometimes 
rélieve pain by wearing a plaster with a 
hole in it, which you can buy from a 
drug store. Sometimes the home remedy 
of painting the bunion with iodine will 
relizve the pain. 

Corns that need cutting should be 
treated always by a chiropodist. More 
harm has been done by cutting corns 
until they bleed and-not being careful 
about wearing colored stockings and the 
result a case of blood poisoning. Better 
spend one dollar than twenty. 

Almost as much harm can be done 
by the use of scissors on the feet. in 
cutting the toe nails they must be cut 
square across and not rounded as your 
finger nails. 

Take care of your feet, pay more at- 
tention to their care, for remember that 
if your feet hurt you you can’t look life 
squarely in the face. It will warp your 
view of life and make you scowl, and 
scowls mean. wrinkles. So look out for 
your feet. 


: Shoulder Straps * 


NOTHER serious question of the day 
4 is the management of the shoulder 
strap. The bateau neck lines continues, 
therefore the nuisance of the exposed 
shoulder strap continues. 


Certain French women exploited at 
Deauville, the French watering place, a 
new invention of a jeweler. [t was a 
pair of fine, platinum chains. One went 
over each shoulder and held the undershirt 
or chemise.~ If this bit of jewelry was ex- 
posed by the oblong opening of the frock, 
who cared? Everyone rejoined. It was a 
pretty bit of finery, a fantastic idea, well 
received. 

The one possible kind of strap is satin 
ribbon or elastic. Hundreds of women 
continue to sit in public places, looking as 
though they thought themselves perfectly 
turned cut while the white ribbons of 
their undershirt and the pink rfbbons of 
their braissicre, rose and fell and looped 
over the bare skin. One wants to throw 
a shawl over such women to hide their 
inadequate interior arrangement of ap- 


parel.

Different Ways to Prepare Ham and Eggs 


< 


SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

To e egg add 1-2 teaspoon Salt, 
1 1-2 tablespoons of milk, few grains pep- 
per, 6 tablespoons butter. Put egg, salt, 
pepper argd milk into small bowl and beat 
slightly with fork. Heat pan, put in but- 
ter and when melted turn in the eggs. 
Cook until of creamy consistency, stirring 
and scaping from the bottom of the pan. 


VARIATIONS. 

1. Use 3 tablespoons tomato sauce in 
piace. of milk in scrambled eggs. 

2. Omit milk and add 1-2 ounce of 
dried beef, 1 tablespoon grated cheese and 
2 tablespoons stewed tomatoes to scram- 
bled eggs before cooking. 

3. Pour undercooked scrambled ezgs 
over milk toast, sprinkle top with grated 
cheese and put in oven. until cheese melts. 

4. All 2 tablespoons of shredfled cod- 
fish to scrambled eggs when they are half 
done. : 


EGG AND CHEESE TOAST. 

Grate 4 ounces of milk cheese, season 
with pepper and salt and add 2 well-beat~ 
en eggs and enough milk to make the 
mixturc thick as. cfeam.. Warm all in a 
saucepan and pour it over rounds or 
squares of hot buttered toast. Serve very 


hot. 


VARIATIONS OF HAM. 

For broiling ham the slices should be 
very thin. Place them on the broiler 
rack and with a high gas flame broil 
the ham quickly, turning it every minute 
until crisp, Drown and tender. If you 
use a frying pan be sure it is hot before 
putting in the ham. Turn the slices every 
minute until crisp. 

Sliced ham may be used in the cas- 
serole in many tempting ways. Have the 
slices thick, at least one inch. The sur- 
face may be covered with sliced onions 
and canned tomatoes poured over it, with 
plenty of seasoning; then it is baked in 
the oven for an hour. 


- 


Or a thick paste of dry mustard and 
milk may be spread on the ham with 
cheese sprinkled over it befure baking 
in the oven. 

Another delicious way is to bake the 
slice of ham for 45 minutes in a small 
amount of water. When done pile cooked 
rice on tip-of the ham and sprinkle grated 
ch over that. Return to the oven to 
melt allt*brown the cheese. 

Or, if preferred, the surface of the ham 
may be covered with sliced potatoes, well 
seasoned, with a sprinkle of cheese on 
top. Cover the whole with milk and bake 
until the potatoes are done. 


TOASTED CRACKERS WITH CHEESE. 


(Sunday Night Suppers.) 

Select good-sized soda or milk crack- 
ers and place on each a thin slice of 
American cheese. Over this lay a small 
strip of thinly sliced, lean bacon; place 
crackers in a baking pan and set in a 
moderate oven until the bacon is brown 
and the cheese melted. 


WAYS TO USE CELERY. 

Celery and Beet Salad.—Use the 
canned beets; eut off the bottoms so they 
will stand upright and hollow out the 
inside so as to form cups. Cut the parts 
taken out into small cubes, add aa equal 
amount of cut celery and a teaspoon of 
strongly seasoned tomato juice. 
mayonnaise, fill the cups and sprinkle 
the tops with grated egg yolks. Place 
on lettuce leaves. 


CELERY AND RICE BASKETS. 

Take cold rice and mold bowl shape, 
invert on baking dish, paint with melted 
butter and heat in oven until slightly 
brown. While hot turn the bowl over ana 
fill empty space with chopped celery, a 
small amount of choppel left-over meat 
and gravy, dust top with cracker crumbs, 
lot with butter and pass with cream sauce. 


New Code of Manners 
On Carrying of Bundles 


HERE was a time when there 
was a strong prejudice on the 
part of a'most everyone who 
could afford to indulge in such 
prejudices against carrying bun- 
dies, especially newspaper 
bundles. Little girls used to be 
told by very proper ladies who 
sez tnemselves up as models of decorum 
that there were three things no “perfect 
lady” ever did. Sometimes these were the 
things—to look in a barber shop window, 
to walk in a city street without gloves, 
or to carry a newspaper bundle. Some- 
times the list varied, but almost always 
there was that little warning about the 
bundle. 

How times change our ideas of “per- 
fect ladies,” or rather how few of us now- 
adays really want to be that creature 
that used to be called a perfect lady. And 
since the war we all carry bundles now 
and then. 

- Jf there is any new code of manners 
concerning this new fad for carrying 
bundles it is this: Carry things in as com- 
pact a form as possible. Get a substan- 
tial basket or bag and be business-like in 
your toting. There is still something 
rather unkempt looking about the woman 
with a lot of little bundles. If she meets 
4 man of her acquaintance he naturally 
asks to help her with her load and the 
task of transferring some ten or a dozen 


little bundles is extremely awkward, 
whereas there is no embarrassment in 
handing over a neatly packed though 
heavy basket or bag. But as much as 
possible the woman who shops or markets 
does so at a time when she will not meet 
the men she knows. She avoids crowding 
the street cars at a time when workers 
are coming home, and she feels a cer- 
tain pride in having depended on the 
assistance of no one to fetch her bundles 
home. 


HERE are a lot of men who are 
really very much embarrassed at 
the prospect of having to carry an awk- 
ward bundle. If their mothers or wives 
suggest that they do it they have a pe 
culiar feeling of rebellion about it, though 
of course they always doit. One reason, 
surely, why a good many young city men 
object to carrying bundies—they wouldn't 
hesitate in the least at carrying a golf 
bag weighing ten pounds or a heavy ulster 
—is because way back when they began 
their career carrying bundles was asso- 
ciated with the errand boy’s job. Maybe 
they were ,errand boys themselves and 
going bundleless to them was a sign of 
a step upward in their career. Perhaps 
that is the reason why young men as @ 
rule rebel more at the no-delivery system 
that is so generally established now than 
do their wives and sisters.

to be encountered upon any civilized land 
or on the Atlantic gcean, across which 
messages continually are crossing and re- 
crossing. 

For this epochal task of determining 
whether or not Mars, or some influence at 
present beyond our human ken, is trying 
to communicate with us, the great inventor 
needs an environment in which there shall 
be as little as possible of such interfer- 
ence. Even the Pacific ocean would gffer 
far less “clear air” than Marconi can find 
upon the Mediterranean. 

It is characteristic of Marconi that he 
never has claimed credit for this feat. it 
was done, he says, by “team-work” and 
to no one individual may be ascribed any 
major portion of the glory of the great 
achievement. 

Senator Marconi’s present cruises are 
preliminary, doubtless, to a greater effort 
to be made in a few months. Doubtless 


oo, 


they are being devoted to perfection of 
his apparatus, to “tuning up,” study and 
general preparations for these days, late 
in the year and éarly in the next, when 
Mars again will be in a position in rela- 
tion to the earth which will be favorable 
to an endeavor upon whatever scale Mar- 
coni by that time may have decided on. 


T HAS been while cruising on the “Elec- 
tra” that Marconi has received, upon 
the yacht’s perfect apparatus, most of the 
mysterious signals which he already has. 
announced may have come from Mars. 
The notable peculiarity of the signals 
which weré received was their extraordi- 
nary “wave length.” In some instances 
this was apparently as great-as 150,000 
metres, whereas the greatest wave-length 
to be produced by any instrument at pres- 
ent on the earth is 14,000 metres, less 
than one-tenth as great.

Things That Make 
Your House More 
Convenient _ 


: OW that Christmas is over, or at 
‘ least the preparation for it, it is 
& g0od time to —_ to spend 
money on your house. 
For one thing, after 
Christmas bilis are paid, you ca 
afford to. ii a 


For another thing, after you 
have looked over your Christmas gifts, 


you will know just what you want. Many 
of us receive from our families and close 
friends gifts for which we have felt a 
‘Teal need in our houses, and the six or 
eight weeks before Christmas is a bad 
time to buy anything for ourselves. We 
ae find it duplicated in a Christmas 


Begin at the front door. In some towns 
the postoffice department has requested 
householders to have mail boxes, as these 
Save much time for the postmen. Maybe 
you want one of these. 


Did you know that you could get 
very good-looking one for a doltar? ot 
black-painted metal, strong and made on 
Kood lines. Of course, you can pay many 
dollars to get something more distinctive, 
and you can have one made to order to 
suit your particular house if you wish to. 


Then there are knockers. It is an 
interesting trick to have a heavy métal 
door-step in the same design as your door 
knocker, if you haye a knocker. Then in 
the summer, when the screen door is on 
and the other door. is kept open, you can 
use your heavy door-stop for this purpose. 
It is really a better plan, just because of 
the wide-open summer door in most of our 
country, to have the door knocker fastened 
at the side of the door, on the frame, 
rather than on the door. There is his- 
torical pattern for this, for in some of the 
lovely old Colonial houses the knockers 
were fastened at the side of the door. 


One interesting door stop, of heav 
brass, is a lion’s foot, with claws. It is 
really exceptionally attractive. 


BO ager you get to considering the in- 
side of your house, don’e you need a 
lamp? Most of us could use one more 
lamp to advantage in our living rooms, 
There are go many lovely électric lamps, 
of all sizes and at all prices, that one 
can never go far wrong in choosing one. 


If you like a lamp that stands from 
the floor, one of those of wrought and 
painted iron is charming, and not very. 
expensive. You can use a shade of silk 
or of parchment on such a lamp. Re- 
member, if you make your own silk 
shades, that you should use three thick- 
nesses of the thin china silk for the shade. 
You can use three different colors, if 
you wish to—rose, between two shades 
of yellow. Thus you get a charmingly 
soft and becoming light. You can even 
effectively use one layer of blue, or bet- 
ter, lavender silk in such a shade. Thus 
you get a blue tone to harmonize with 
blue furnishings, but at the same time 
get the attractive warm tone of yellow 
or pink when the shade is lighted. Re- 
member always that it is the lighted shade 
that makes or mars one’s looks. Unlight- 
ed it may give a cold blue touch of color 
to the room; so long as lighted it sheds 
a rosy, warm light. 


NOTHER thing you may need is a 

little stand. Really the Christmas 
display of small stands this year has been 
so attractive that it has been difficult 
not to spend in the imagination a big for- 
tune just on little tables. There are kid- 
ney stands, those softly rounded little 
tables that just fit in front of one for 
books or work, there are bookstands, with 
an uper anl lower shelf, invaluable in a 
family where there are many books to be 
gathered up and returned to their places. 


Hints That Help 


N a custard recipe calling for several 

eggs, one or more may be left out if 
half a teaspoon of cornstarch is added 
for each egg omitted. 

A few cloves in the kettle of fat give 
doughnuts a nice flavor. 

Save all the liquid from your mus- 
tard pickles and add it to salad dress- 
ing in place of fresh vinegar and mus- 
tard. When making meat sandwiches 
this liquid may be mixed with the meat. 

Save the excess liquid from your 
pickled peaches. It may be used for 
mince pies, sauces, etc. 

When you light the oven to your gas 
stove for baking fill your kettle or a 
large pan with water and set on top of 
oven. 

When you are ready to wash up, you 
have hot water without using an extra 
burner.

What E 


Get Sométhing You 
Want With That 
Christmas Money 


ee eee 


T 18 a shame to put Christmas 
money in the pot to pay general 
expenses. Usnally it is given to 
you with the hepe that you will 
buy what you want and that it 
will be more exactly what you 
want than if the giver makes the 
selection. It certainly is not 
given you to pay the bil-s that you have 
run up buying Christmas presents for 
other people, or to pay the water bill or 
to pay your first installment on the in- 
come tax after the first of January. 


The money put in your hands for your 
children at Christmas-——-how do you spend 
that? If they really, need shaes and you 
are pinched for funds then no doubt you 
can spend it profitably for such needfuls. 

Always, of course, it is a good plan to 
put children’s money of This sort in the 
bank. More than one boy has gone to 
college or started there on not very large 
amounts of Christmas money earefully 
_banked by a conservative mother or fa- 
“ ther. 

Almost as much of an investment as 
this does the Christmas money become 
when it is spent 'to start . good library 
for the child. This does not mean to buy 
just the books that the child will like to 
devour in childhood. There are classics 
that are always valuable in any library. 
Sets of books by standard authors that 
will prove useful later and that will help 
develop an appreciation of good literature 
may be selected. Really good pictures 
also are a good way to spend Christmas 
money for your children. 


YOT to be looked down upon among 
N possible ways of spending Christmas 
money for children is the purchase of 
‘silver spoons and other pieces of fiat sil- 
ver. This, of course is suitable for little 
girls, not for their brothers. It is not 
difficult in the course of .. little girl’s life 
before she becomes a big girl to accumu- 
late a dozen or so teaspoon’ or a dozen 
knives, forks and spoons t» match in some 
standard pattern. There are few of us 
who would not cherish sucl a collection 
in later years and most littie girls take 
an interest in such an accumulation. 

Of course, the child, if -:ft to his own 
devices will usually want to spend ais 
Christmas money for toys and more toys. 
And after Christmas days offer a good 
opportunity for buying toys at a reduced 
figure. And toys are not to be frowned 
upon. The child who plays intensively 
usually becomes a good worker and a 
good student later, and very often a chiad 
will play intensively if he 1s allowed to 
p!ay with the sort of toys he would choose 
himself. If he has set hid young mind 
on a hobby horse, why get him wooden 
blocks? To be sure the blocks appear more 
instructive, but who knows what adven- 
ture, what feats of daring and bravery 
the child will imagine as he goes canter- 
Ing back and forth oh the hobby horse he 
wanted with ail his heart’? 

OR yourseif--wnat avout your OwD 

Christmas money? 

Most true housewives spend such 
money with most pleasure when they 
spend it to beautify their house. For the 
woman with a hows? finds her personal 
environment just as truly in the decora- 
tions and furnishings of her home as does 
the woman who does not care and does 
not possess a home in the clothes she 
wears. It is true that you can get alon;, 
on much simpler clothes and fewer of 
them if you have the background of a 
well-farnished and tasteful home. The 
advantage of things for your home over 
things for your back is that household 
things have a way of lasting many times 
as long as hats er frocks or coats Or ap 
parel generally. 

Why not be quite bold about it and 
take down th pictures that you don’t 
like that have been hanging on your wall 
for years just because you don’t know 
what else to do with them and didn’t have 
any pictures you liked better? Then with 
the Christmas money start out and get 
just the few pictures you really like. 

Sometimes a trip through the shops 
immediately after Christmas will reveal 
eome real though wnadvertised bargains 
in the way of merchandis. that has been 
sought for Christmas selling, but for some 
reason or other has not bee. disposed of. 
At any rate, there is a feelirg of satisfac- 
tion to be gained from a trip to the shops 
with the knowledge that you can bay any 
one of°a number of things with money 
that is yours to spend exactly as you 
please. "

[To Attract the \V oman Who Likes Frills

pretty bits of wearing apparel, 
of the smaller sort, in the shops 


envious and wish the 
wealth of an old-fashioned, world-loving 
queen, to spend it all in trifles. - 


Take gloves, for a beginning, for gloves 
have .a standing again. They are not 
worn contemptuously, now, just to keep 
one’s fingers from chiliblains. No, in- 
deed, gloves are worn ostentatiously, 
gaudily. They are beautiful things, these 
new gloves, and we wear them gaily. 

White ones, for instance. Some of 
heavy white kid have gauntlet cuffs with 
a line of slashed kid fringe edging them 
and running down one side of the slashed 
gauntlet cuffs. bs 

Some white kid gloves*are embroid- 
ered on the ‘back in colored beads, but so 
attractively that they don’t seem com- 
monplace. Their price, of course, is any- 
thing but commonplace, unless one is so 


now that it is difficult not to . 


used to high prices for gloves now that 
the big prices have become common- 
place. *~ 

Then there is the black kid trimming 
to the white glove. Cuffs faced with 
black kid, wrists decorated with black 
kid fCuteuts. <a 

And there are the black kid gloves 
similarly trimmed with white- 


Manners and 


the Minister 


F YOUR minister has a wife, re- 
member that it is just as rude to 
ask him to dinner without her 


or to take part in any purely-so-- 


cial gathering without her as it 
would be to ask any other man 
to your house socially without 
his wife. 


However there are times when a min- 
ister comes to your house in a purely pro- 
fessional capacity when you need not ask 
his wife to be with him. It may be that 
your daughter is to be married and for 
some reason or other you wish to have 
only members of your own immediate fam- 
ily circle present at the ceremony. This 
would be the case in the event of a recent 
death in the family. If you do not know 
the minister's wife extremely well you 
would not be expected even to ask her 
to be present. [ff a breakfast er a lunch- 
eon follows the ceremony for the mem- 
bers of the family you would, of course, 
ask the minister to remain as a matter 
of convenience to him. That is perhaps 
the only case when you might ask your 
minister to be your guest at a meal witb- 
out asking his wife. 

If there are any outsiders at all pres- 
ent at the wedding you should always 
ask the minister’s wife, whether you are 
personally acquainted with her or not. 
You showld feel no offense, however, if 
she does not attend. 


O NOT make the mistake of feeling 
that you must always pul! a long face 
the minister appears on the scene. 
very tireseme to him. If he hap- 

for a ministerial call on 

wt your card club meets 

perate attempt to hide 


y playing cards. The chances 


are that he does not disapprove. if he 
does, you are only acting the part of cow- 
ard if you try to conceal what you have 
been doing. 

Remember that a clergyman naturally 
enjoys some social life aside from his 
purely ministerial work. If you are friend- 
ly with him idiclude him as a guest some- 
times when you are to have interesting 
guests to dinner. Don’t always feel that 
you must have only church members pres- 
ent. It is courteous but not necessary to 
ask him to ask a blessing. Speak to him 
about it before going in to dinner. It is 
better to do this than to wait till you have 
assembled at the table, as some clergy- 
men prefer to say grace standing. This 
is perhaps the more usual way at a din- 
ner party. - 


LWAYS give your clergyman the re- 

spect due to his position, but if he .s 
4 young man do uot make the mistake of 
treating him with so much respect that 
one might think he was very aged and 
feeble. Some people do this, you know. 
They always urge the minister into the 
easiest chair, they speak especially dis- 
tinctly to him and they refrain from mer- 
rymaking and laughing when in his pres- 
ence. | 


Custom of showing respect to the min- | 


ister varies in the different churches. 
Whatever the custom is with your church, 
do not fail to observe it. Remember that 
theoretically speaking, any clergyman, no 
matter how shabbiiy dressed, is entitleu 
to the same respect as any other clergy- 
man. Ha is always socially your equal. 
To treat him as such is not so much a 

tribute to him as an honor you 
will probably want to pay to the profes- 
Si0M. oo

HEN you come to hair ernaments, 
there are wreaths of laure! leaves 
in silver and gold, that keep their vogue. 
There are big combs covered with tiny

too, knotted into little flowers. There i1°

The Proper Way | 
Fo Use a Fork 


|Q NOT grasp the fork as if it 
| were a garden spade_or 2 screw- 
driver. 

On the other hand, avoid the 
manner of the overdainty folk 
who hold the fork gingeriy be- 
tween first finger ard thumo 
with the other fingers curled in 

midair. Strike a happy medium between 
these two methods. 

The tendency nowadays is to eat 
everything .hat one can with the fork, 
and the suggestion has been made thar 
the ultra fastidious will soon attempt to 
use a fork for hot chocolate. Ice cream is 
preferably eaten with a fork and for this 
reason it suould be served in as solid a 
form as possiPWle. 

In eating salad only the fork shou'd 
be used—never the knife. It is permis- 
sible to cut the leaves of the lettuce or 
other green with the side of the fork if 
they are served whole. 


The fork should never be used to mast , 


or mix the food together. To inash pota- 
toes or other vegetables in this way so 
that they will better mix with the meat 
gravy is in extremely baa form, 


EAS should be caten with a tork. 

with a spoon, and they shouid 
pierced with the tines of the tork, 
scooped up. 

In certain strict boarding schools 
where table manners are part of the cur- 
riculum _the pupils are taught never to 
use the fork in the right hand, but to re- 
serve that hand solely ior the use of a 
knife or spoon. However, this is diffi- 
cult for most persons, and in this coun- 
try many well-bred persons do use thie 
fork in the right hand. This is perfect 
permissible so long .as they do not yicld 
to the temptaticn of using that fmplemant 
as a shovel.
