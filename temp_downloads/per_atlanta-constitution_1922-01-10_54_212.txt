Monday afternoon at 6:15 o'clock 
voted to employ 50 additional police-

since 1910, and in authorizing the 
purchase of land and the construction 
of two sub police stations, the com-

_ Official announcement was made 

today that soviet Russia would 
be represented at the forthcoming 
economic conference to be _ held 
at Genoa. This information was con- 
tained in a wireless dispatch received 
by the supreme council before a for- 
mal invitation to the soviet govern- 
ment had actually been drawn up, and 
the speed with which the Russians 
have replied to the announcement that 
they were to be invited was construed 
to mean that they are keenly desirous 
of joining with the nations on almost 
any terms: table to the allies.

vitations for the gathering at Genoa 
was confronted, tonight by the nice 
diplomatic question of whether it 
should send out an invitation to a 
country which already had signified 
its intention to be present. 
Simultaneously with the making 
public of Russia’s intention to have 
representation at Genoa, it became 
known that the German delegation,

organization meeting of the loca! com-

The fund will be applied in giving ap-

form especially meritorious acts or un- 
selfish services which advance the 
principles of Woodrow Wilson. Geor- 
gia’s quota in the drive is $35,000. 

Although subscriptions will not be 
solicited of the churches, it is ex- 
pected that announcements of the 
“Woodrow Wilson hour,“ 12 to 1 
o’clock Monday, will be made from 
the pulpits of Atlanta churches Sun- 
day. It is probable that a meeting to 
celebrate the Wilson hour will be held 
in Atlanta. 

Mrs. T. T. Stevens, prominent club- 
woman and civic leader, was desig-

to airplanes and dirigibles.

West Peachtree Widening. 


Monday afternoon’s session of the 
finance committee was opened by the 
request of Frank P. Rice for an ap- 
propriation to buy materials necessary 
for widening West Peachtree street. 
He said that the widening would in- 
crease the traveling capacity of the 
street 50 per cent and that it would 
be worth to the city $500,000. - 

In fact,”. he said, later on the 
city couldn't buy the opportunity to 
widen the street for a haif-million 
dollars.” He also said that within 
three years the increased assessments 
caused by the widening of the street 
would repay the eits fer the $50,800 
appropriation. Mrs. W. C, Hardin 
and falter Candler also spoke for 
the measure. Mr. Rice said that he 
had spoken with Oscar Mills and that 
the latter had said that if the city 
paid for the materials the county 
would furnish the necessary labor. 

At Monday morning’s session of the 
committee, figures indicating a .cur- 
rent revenue for Atlanta in 1922 of 
$6,312,736 were adopted. Of the cur- 
rent revenue, 26 per cent, or about 
$2,000,000, in addition to the state 
school fund of $155,000, non-resident 
tuition fees of $10,000 and an amount 
due from the previous year of 
$183,000, will, go to the city schools. 


Home for Girls. 


The committee Monday morning 
also appropriated 85.000 for the rental 
and equipment, and $100 per month 
for the upkeep of an industrial home 
for. girls released from the cit§ stock- 
ade. A delegation of women, headed 
by Mrs. Houston Johnson and Mrs. 
James L. Key, asked for this appro- 

riation. Additional funds -for: the 

ome will be lied, it is said, by 
the Witches’ clu}; Christian en, 
Woman's club and the Junio# lsague. 
The committee also voted 815.000 for 
improvements on Williams and James 
streets. The appropriation was quali- 
fied on the connty commission making 
an appropriation. |

ON COMPTON MURDER 


Continued from First Page. 


derer to leave the gun at the scene of 
the crime. 

It was pointéd out to the jury, and 
ly accepted, that the man who 

illed Mr. Compton, i there were such 
a man, fired the bullet from the rear 
seat of the automobile, since all cur- 
tains on ‘the car were up, and since 
there was no hole in the curtains large 
enough for a man to put his hand 
through. : 

Miss Bostick’s Testimony. 

Miss Fannie Bostick, stenographer, 
employed at the overall plant and who 
was waiting for Mr. Compton to get 
his car and take her Home on the 
night he was discovered dead, took the 
stand and gave her testimony. 

“T have been working at the office 
for 18 years,” said Miss Bostick, “and 
I knew Mr. Compton and his habits 
well. On Thursday afternoon I was 
waiting at the office for him, after he 
had requested that I remain there un- 
til he went to the garage and got his 
car. He had asked that I remain at 
the office after the usual closing time 
to receive a long distance telephone he 
was expecting. The call was from 
Greensboro, Ga., and had to do with 
some stock quotations. ' 

“About 6 o’clock I started to go 
home and Mr. Compton walked to the 
door of the office with me and said if 
L would wait for him to get his car, 
he would take me home. He left me 
at the door. going in the direction of 
the garage.” 

Told He Was Killed. 

After waiting for several minutes, 
Miss Bostick continued, she heard 
some one connected with the Harry G. 
Poole undertaking establishment say 
that a man was trying to steal Mr. 
Compton’s automobile. Then in a few 
minutes some one else told her that 
Mr. Compton had been found dead. 

Miss Compton declared that Mr. 
Compton’s affairs, both personal and 
otherwise, were, so far as she knew, 
in excellent shape, and that the year 
1920 had been an unusually properous 
one for him. 
Miss Bostick’s testimony was the 
last to be received by the jury, after 
which Coroner Donehoo charged the 
jury, which retired and several 
minutes later returned with its 
verdict. 

Charles T. Nunnally, president of 
the firm of which Mr, Compton had 
for years been a trusted member, 
stated that he was convinced the 
theory of suicide was absurd. 

“Only one thing can sustain the 


theory of suicide,” he declared, “and: 


that is a motive. Mr. Compton could 
have had no possible reason for de- 
siring to take his own life. He was a 
nerfect physical specimen of manhood. 
He was popular. both socially and in 
business circles. He had no bad habits. 
There is only one solution, and that 
is that he was murdered—murdered in 
cold blood, without a chance to defend 
himself.“ 
No Robbery Evidence. 

The robbery theory was not susta in- 
ed by any evidence submitted to the 
jury, it being pointed out that robbers 


would have rifled his pockets after 


committing the crime, whereas there 
was no evidence that papers or other 
articles in Mr. Compton’s possession 
had been disturbed. 

It .was. further stated by intimate 
friends of the dead man that he was 
never known to carry any large 
amount of money anc. when his body 
was discovered, he only had a little 
more than a dollar in change in his 


pockets. 


Motives of revenge, jealousy and 
even the attempted theft of his car 
were considered, but in each case evi- 
dence was lacking.

The economic commission decided 
upon an international corporation with 
a capital of two million pounds with 
its seat in London, and with a board 


companies in each interested country. 
These countries, including the United 
States, will organize corporations for 
promotion only, with a combined cap- 
ital equivalent to twenty million 
pounds. ‘These corporations will serve 
as mediums for credit transactions 
and facilitating the activities of pri- 
vate enterprises in all countries where 
the business field now is obstructed 
by lack of credits and disorganized 
finances. 

This plan presupposes the organi- 
zation of affiliated companies in Ger- 
many as well as the United States. 

Security for ce. 

There remains to be settled the 
question what shall be the French 
share in the German reparation pay- 
ments. M. Briand, the French pre- 
mier, today asked the supreme council 
to give him time to consult with the 
finance commission of the French 
chamber of deputies and probably will 
give his final answer tomorrow. Presi- 
dent Millerand also probably will be 
consulted before the French finally 
accept the new scheme, only a few de- 
tails of which have been given out. 

There seems to be little doubt in 
either French or British circles that 
the conference will not adjourn until 
a pact has been agreed upon by France 
and Great Britain which will give 
the security to France that che has de- 
manded ever since the peace confer- 
ence. French circles tonight seemed 
very much relieved over the prospects 
of an accord that will permit France 
to make an immense saving in the 
upkeep of her army, while at the same 
time removing her preoccupation con- 
cerning her eastern neighbor. 

An exchange of views concerning 
Asia Minor is going on in private con- 
versations between. Premier Briand, 
Marquis Curzon, the British foreign 
secretary, and the Marquis Della 
Torreta, the Italian minister of for- 
eign affairs. There are indications 
that this question may be settled more 
easily than had been expected, the 
British showing less opposition to 
dealing with the followers of Musta- 
pha Kemal Pasha, the Turkish na- 
tionalist leader. In well informed 
sources it is said the settlement may 
be in the nature of an extension of 
the Franco-Turkish accord to Great 
Britain and Italy.

JAPAN CERTAIN 
TO BE THERE. 

Washington, January 9.—(By the 
Associated Press.)—Japan will surely 
be represented at the Genoa confer- 
ence, Japanese spokesmen said today, 
and she will be particularly desirous 
of participating in the discussions if 
Russian representatives are to take 
part in the deliberations. 

Under the uncertain conditions pre- 
vailing throughout the territory which 
formed a part of the original Russian 
empire, Siberia, it is believed, is still 
to be considered an integral part of 
Russia and i view of Japan's proxim- 
ity to Siber and her economic in- 
terest in the development of that 
country it is pointed out that Japan 
as a vital interest in any develop- 
ments that affect the future of Rus- 
sia generally. 

Moreover, A7 is a member of the 
supreme council and as a world power, 
it is declared, although somewhat re- 
moved from the immediate problems 
of the economic reconstruction of 
Europe, possesses a growing interest 
in the reconsctruction of Europe. 

The probability of the discussion 
of Russian problems at Genoa has 
raised the question as to how far the 
Siberian question would be discussed 
at the present Washintgon conference. 
While dwelling upon the primary im- 
portance of the Genoa deliberations, 
members of the Japanese delegation 
said today they desired to make it 
clear that Japan had no intention of 
evading any’ 
of matters peftaining to Siberia and 
to the Far East generally. 

“We have come here for the pur- 
pose of discussing Far Eastern mat- 
ters, as well as*naval questions,” said 
a Japanese official, “and we are pre- 
pared to go into a thorough discussion 


of any point_which is found upon the 


erican conference agenda. 

“Admiral Baron Kato, our senior 
delegate, and a large party are plan- 
ning to sail for Japan January 24, 
from San Francisco on the steamer 
Shinyo Maru, which means that the 
baron would have to leave Washing- 
ton by January 18 or 19. But Ad- 
miral Kato is determined to remain 
until the conference is over, and he 
will cancel his passage if such be 
necessary.” 

It appears quite possible now that 
a large quota of the 4 — delega- 
tion headed by General Tanaka, the 
chief army expert, will leave by the 
Shinyo Maru whatever may be the 
status of the conference.

Referring to the efforts toward re- 
duced car fares for school ch.!dren, 
President Gaines took a rap at Pres- 
ton S. Arkwright, president of the 
Georgia Hailway and Power company. 
Our school board, some weeks ago,” 
de said, “in co-operation with various 
civic organizations, petitioned the lo- 
cal street railway for this concession, 
But, upon a hearing, the requeg was 
denied by the company. The hearing 
on that occasion, if, indeed, you might 
cell it a hearing, was most peculiar, 

“The delegation was received with 
the utmost grace by the president of 
the company. He heard us present 
out case with seeming interest and 
with a seeming desire to know the 
merits of our contention. Then when 
the hearing was over, he drew out of 
his desk a carefully prepared answer 
and read it off to us.” 
Superintendent Sutton’s report 
showed that the school enrollmert has 


| rmereased to 40,360, making necessary 


during the past 12 months the eree- 
tion of 19 rtable schoolhouses and 
the rental of many annexes; that new

the number of foreign classes be in-

the - newly-organized opportunity 
school every encouragement and pre- 
dicted that its present enrollment of 


361 will have grown to 1,000 by the h 


end of the year. 

Reporting on double sessions, Mr. 
Sutton said that “while every effort 
has been made to eliminate the dou- 
ble session classes from the white 
schools, and as far as possible from 
the negro schools, we are forced to 
admit that there are still some places 
where it is absolutely necessary that 
we have short ons and double 
sessions during the day. We have at 
present one afternoon session for white 
and 67 for negroes. There are also 
fourteen special afternoon tlasses for 
negroes, making a total of 150 classes 
affected by shortened sessions, 
either in the morning or the after- 
noon.” 


Praise for Teachers. 


Of the teachers and principals, Mr. 
Sutton declared too much cannot be 
said of the splendid spirit of the 
teachers and principals. Coming into 
office with but little knowledge of 
the system, and almost entirely igno- 
rant of many of the details of our 
grammar schools, the present super- 
intendent would have been unable to 
accomplish but little had it not been 
for the wonderful co-operation of the 
principals and teachers. The morale, 
the spirit and the culture of our pres- 
ent teaching force has no superior 
and but few equals in America.” 

Superintendent Sutton urged the 
devising of a plan for the rental of 
textbooks to children; recommended 
the establishment of an open-air 
school for pupils who have weak 
lungs; reviewed and praised the work 
of the supervisors and direttors, the 
board of lady visitors, the Parent- 
Teacher associations, the Junior 
league, the Atlanta Woman’s club and 
other organizataions and individuals 
that have assisted the schools. He 
acknowledged indebtedness of the 
school department to the public health 
nurses for their splendid work, and 
to the various social agencies that 
have co-operated. 

Open-Air School. 

With particular reference to an 
open-air school he said that the Anti- 
Tuberculosis association, the R 
Cross, the Junior league, the Asso- 
ciated Charities and the overseas 
girls have promised to aid in its es- 
tablishment and maintennace, some 
of them offering financial assistance, 
and he recommended that such a 
school be/ made one of the emergent 
propositions to be finaneed with pro- 
ceeds of the bond issue. 

A large delegation of fifth ward 
women and men headed by W. E. 
Fleming, appeared before the board 
urging its purchase of a lot adja- 
cent to the English Avenue school for 
a future annex. Mr. Fleming and 
the lot is 278 feet on Fox street 
153 feet on English avenue and 136 
feet on Chestnut street and could 
be bought for $15,350. The board 
referred the petition of the delega- 
tion to the finance committee. 

Mrs. George W. Price, president of 
the Inman Park Parent-Teacher asso- 
ciation, appeared before the board to 
that more desirable quarters be 

rovided for two grades‘of the Inman 
Park school now located in basement 
rooms. Her request was referred to 
the building committee. 

In its report to the board, read by 

rs. Z. V. Peterson, the board of lady 
visitors recommended the purchase of 
a lot adjacent to the Adair school as 
the site for an annex.

you against the outside enemy. 

As Auxiliary Army. 

“In the meantime you must regard 
us as an auxiliary army with our ob- 
jective the independence of Ireland. 

“We feel that you signed a docu- 
ment that you cannot keep, but we 
won’t interfere.” 

Nobody wants to vote against 
Eawonn De Valera,” said Griffith in 
the course of the debate that preceded 
the vote, “but he is being used to get 
around the treaty. De Valera had no 
need to resign. His resignation and 
his candidacy were simply attempts 
to wreck the treaty.” 

Explaining the attitude of the De 
Valera followers, Minister of Defense 
Burgess told the dail: Tou treaty 
supporters can go ahead and carry 
out the treaty. We won't co-operate, 
but we will not imterfere.” 

Griffith Nominated. 
„ Griffith was nominated for the pres - 
ideney by Collins, but a vote on this 
went over. a 

Collins moved an amendment to the 

original mofton to re-elect De Valera 
resident of the republic, which would 
ave stipulated that the house asks 
Arthur Griffith to form a provisional 
government.” The speaker ruled that 
the amendment was a separate motion 
and that the dail must vote on the 
question of the presidency first. 

The dail adjourned without voting 
on Collins’ motion. 

Collins admitted, in reply to De 
Valera, that the dail must have a 
president, but urged that Griffith be 
elected, and suggested 
election might be held. 

De Valera inquired whether the re- 
publican funds would be used in the 
interest of the Free State, to which 
Collins suggested that an arrange-

of wing himself from the dail 
and setting up a new “republic” of

who have fought the treaty chroughout 
its stormy passage in the Irish par- 
liament. 
The efforts of Collins and Griffith

Ens declared that the time for talking

ing a government was now paramount.

Refuses to Co-operate. ö 

“In view of the vote on the peace 
‘reaty, which tends to subvert the re- 
public,” said De Valera in his address 
of resignation, “I can continue no 
ionger. I resign, and with me goes the 
cabinet.” 

Collins immediately jumped to his 
{vet and suggested the formatior of a 
joint committe: from both factions to 
continue the work. De Valera replied 
by refusing to co-operate, and demand- 
ed an immediate election of new offi- 
cers, whereupon he was himself nomi- 
pated by Mrs. Clarke, over the pro- 
‘ests of several members of the dail. 

the final vote, De Valera was 
found to have been defeated, 60 te 58. 

O’Kelly, whip for the De Valera 
party, urged that the republican or- 
ganization be maintain „until we 
are assured that England will keep 
her promises.” 

“We will fight if she doesn’t,” 
Micky Collins, McKeown, and other 
members declared, 

The treaty leaders will not an- 
nounce their plan of procedure until 
De Valera has signified his intentions. 
It is wholly possible that before the 
whole parliamentary tangle is solved, 
a general Irish election based flatly 
on acceptance or rejection of the 
treaty, may be called.

law body, which tries to balk all effort 
to introduce efficiency methods in the 
government departments. It is de- 
clared the federation has lost a great 


deadlock on reclassification legislation. 
Fight on Bonus. 

The enemies of the federation have 
determined to fight out the bonus issue 
to the end. It is no longer any secret 
that dominant influences in both the 
house and senate appropriation com- 
mittees are op to the continuance 
of the war-time $240 bonus. They 
served notice when the last sundries 
civil bill was passed that there would 
be no continuance of the bonus this 
year. 

It is not proposed to withdraw the 

000,000 involved in the present 
bonus payments. Under the executive’ 
order issued by President Harding re- 
cently, and providing for efficiency 
ratings and other forms of reclassifica- 
tion, it is proposed to redistribute the 
bonus payments among the employees, 
not on a flat per capita basis, but 
on the basis of efficiency and length 
and character of service. An effort 
will be made to take the bonus away 
from the lower grades of clerks and 
stenographers and give it to the un- 
derpaid employees of the scientific bu- 
reau and to the lower administrative 
nositions. Senator Smoot and his ad- 


Mr. Madden explained that the $240 
bonus was not estimated in the bud- 
get. The attitude of the floor in 
explaining that it was left out of the 
treasury department’s appropriation 
bill, was that he thought that pro- 
vision for the bonus ought not to 
be included in any one bill until the 
end of the regular supply bill, when 
it could be appropriated in a lump 


sum. 
| “he idea in thus leaving it out of 


the several departmental appropria- 
tion measures was that members 
congress are hoping that the reclassi- 
fication measure, which has already 
been passed by the house and which 
absorbs the $240 bonus, will have been 
passed before the new fiscal year. In 
that event, there will be no need for 
bonus provision in the current 
ills. 

All of which gives one another re- 
markable insight into how the repub- 
lican leaders attempt to fool the public 
with their budgets and their initial 
appropriation bills, in the political 
claim for “normalcy” and “economy.”

“Faith, courage and work are need- 
ed today in order that America may 
maintain her position as the greatest 


Tregoe, executive secretary of the Na- 
tional Association of Oredit Men, be- 
fore the members of the Atlanta asso- 
ciation at a banquct given in his hon- 
or Monday night at the Peacock cafe. 

“The task of today,” said, the speak- 
er, “is the task of peace—the inost 
momentous task and the greatest crisis 
the world has ever faced. This morn- 


ing as I passed the monument of Hen- 
ry Grady, standing like a rock in the 


surging tide of one of your great 
streams of traffic, I breathed a prayer 
of thankfulness for a man who spent 
his life in the cause of peace. ‘The 
world calls today for others of his 
kind, if they can be found. The monu- 
ment of the warrior in another gener- 
ation will have disappeared and in its 
place will be the monument of the 
man who fought the battle of peace.” 
Moral Courage Needed. 


Mr. Tregoe, whose subject was „es- 


terday, Ioday and Tomorrow,” said, 
in part: 

“What the world needs row is men 
who think and men who work—wmoral 
courage instead of physical courage. 

“The bone must be taken from the 
head and put into the back. 

“The events of today are merely se- 
quences of the events of yesterday, 
and what will happen tomorrow are 
aay the sequences of the events of 
today. 

“We cannot appreciate the real 
strides of our nation without f#feview- 
ing a little of yesterday. 

“For the first 115 years of our na- 
tional life we were merely getting our 
stride, and during this time we added 
less than $1,000,000 per year to the 
national wealth. We had been work- 
ing in this period along individual 
lines largely, and not until the begin- 
ning of the twentieth century did the 
vision come of what co-operation could 
produce. When we began eam work 
in earnest, when we recognized that 
a man left to himself could not grow, 
from 
1908 for one decade we moved along 


so splendidly and efficiently that I have 


ealled it the golden age of American 
industry. 
Gain in Wealth. 

“In this decade, we added to our 
national wealth about eight billions 
a year on the average. In 1903, the 
manufacturing capital of the nation 
was about ‘twelve billions. In 1913 
it had increased to twenty-two billions. 
This ability to produce and to 
sell at home and abroad at fair 
profits brought to the nation in 1915 
and 1916 an addition in its national 
wealth of about eleven billions each 
year. This increase in wealth was 
reflected in increased capital and not- 
withstanding the heavy demand com- 
ing from abroad and also increasing at

produced and marketed them without 
any strain on credit or any apprecia- 
ble advance in the market rates for 
money. 

“In 1917 and 1918, our entrance 
into the war accelerated greatly the 
demands on our pfoductive powers. 

“We failed to realize after the ar- 
mistice that the supreme call on the 
world was to halt in production, to 
get its breath, to figure out the future 
and see what the safe courses were. 
We did not do this. We continued to 
meet the heated demand for commodi- 
ties, emanating largely trom personal 
extravagances rather than from needs. 

“Credit was raped very badly in 
1919. Liquid assets were converted 
by the billions into fixed capital, and 
we failed to see that we were fast 
reaching a period of overproduction, 
and from which there could no re- 
sult but sharp contraction and liqui- 
dation. When the peak of production 
was reached in the spring of 1920, 
with almost mythical prices for com- 
modities of all kinds and for labor, 
the available capital had been ex- 
hausted and we were due the most se- 
rious debacle of our national history. 
Under this load was placed all the 
powers of the federal reserve system. 
The raising of the rediscount rates 
did not exhaust the loaning powers of 
the Federal Reserve banks so they 
stood under the strain, reducing their 
reserves, increasing the federal re- 
serve notes until the time came when 
the strain was lifted and liquidation 
could be carried on in an orderly fash-

attitude is not sufficiently constant. 
We believe firmly chat despite the 
failures reasonable to antieipate in 
the future that basic conditions will 
continue to improve, and we shali have 
some revival in the early spring. 

“Too much mustn’t be expected of 
1922. It cannot be but a subrormal 
year, with our agriculture in such poor 
productive condition and our neigh- 
bors so badly off in the world’s goods. 
The attitude of the American business 
man in this situation is faith and

CAMP BENNING 
PRIVATE SHOOTS 
- SELF TO DEATH 


Columbus, Ga., January 9.— (Spe. 
cial.)—Private Lloyd E. Baker, 17 
years old, killed himself this afternoon 
while alone in his tent at Camp Ben- 
ning. Comrades, rushing to the tent 
after hearing a shot, found the top of 
Baker’s head blown — and his service 
rifly lying by his side. a 

The bail entered above the right ear 
and came out above the left ear. A 
board of investigation has been ap- 
pointed to convene tomorrow morning 
to determine whether death was acci- 
dental or suicidal. Baker had been at 
Benning since July. His home was in 
Kansas City, Mo. A mother survives 
him.

were pronounced out of danger today. 
Sjoerd Folkersma was the only one 
seriously affected by the stain, but 
his condition was greatly improved to- 
day. ; 
The sacramental wine was kept in a 
closet under the choir loft. A jug of 
wood stain used in repairs to the 
church also had been placed ir. the 
closet and one of the elders, prepar 
ing the communion, accidentally put

Clear Conscience. 

“Upon these facts, as I then be- 
lieved them to be, and as I now believe 
them to be, 1 shall abide the result 
with a clear conscience,” Mr. New- 
berry added, in a dramatic conclusion 
of his prepared address. His col- 
league, Senator Townsend, annouaced 
last Saturday that Mr. Newberry 
would submit to questioning by sen- 
ators, but not to heckling or cross- 
examination. 


A business man and not an expe- 
rienced public speaker, Senator New- 
berry,. of short, sturdy figure, with 
glasses over his blue eyes, said he de- 
sired to give the senate what little 
information he had personally regard- 
ing the charges made against his man- 
ner of election. At the outset he 
asked that he be not interrupted until 
he concluded his prepared address. 

K. can not remain silent any longer 
during the consideration of my right 
to represent the state of Michigan 
as one of its senators,” he said. “I 
did not volunteer to appear before 
the committee, of the senate which took 
testimony in this matter because I 
really had no information that would 
assist in the investigation of the 
charges filed by my opponent. It 
seems to me that the-time has come 
to speak, because my silence might be 
misunderstood by my friends. 


State Whole Case. 


“As my colleagues in this body 
know, and as is also well known. by 
my associates and constituents in the 
state of Michigan, 1 am not accus- 
tomed ‘to public speaking, and what- 
ever service I have been able to ren- 
der to my country or to others, has 
been entirely along lines remote from 
oral debate. Therefore, I earnestly 
request my associates in the senate to 
permit me to proceed with my state- 
ment without interruption. 


“I shall state the whole case as I 
know it, fully, frankly and honestly, 
as in the presence of God and before 
my fellow senators in this great tri- 
bunal; and I shall do this just as 
completely as I am able to do it. I 
can add absolutely nothing to what 
I am about to state to the senate. I 
must abide by whatever effect it may 
have upon the conscience and the judg- 
ment of the members of this body. 


“On the 6th day of June, 1917, I 
was commissioned a lieutenant-com- 
mander in the United States navy, and 
on July 23, 1917, I was assigned to 
the third navel district with headquar- 
ters in the Brooklyn navy yard. I 
immediately took up my duties there. 
and from that day, July 23, 1917, I 
was never in Michigan a single hour. 
The primary election, and 
the general election of 1918 occurred 
during my absence from the state of 
Michigan. In the early fall of 1917 
I began to receive visits and letters 
from men active in public and politi- 
cal affairs in Michigan, urging me to 
become a candidate on the republican 
ticket for United tSates senator. I 
was not unmindful of the suggested 
honor, and yet I fully realized that I 
certainly would not resign my com- 
mission-in the navy to me a can- 
didate for any political office, and that 
I could not take any personal active 
interest in a campaign while I con- 


dation.” 


any direct connection 
tion of the committee o 


King did not originate with me. 
ve not in a? way arranged by me. 
I knew Mr. King but slightly. My 
last contact with him had been in 
1912, when we were political ofpo- 
nents, 

“In my judgment Paul King is a 
man of the highest character and 
sterling integrity, and when he had 
been selected as manager of the sena- 
torial campaign in Michigan, which 
was done without the slightest knowl- 
edge on my part, he insisted that be- 
fore he would even accept, much less 
undertake to enter upon the work of 
the campaign, he should and must 
learn for himself, because of our dif- 
ferences in 1912, whether or not his 
management of the senatorial cam- 
paign would be entirely acceptable to 
me. 


Discussed Cost. 

“He came to New York and we had 
a brief interview there. We did not 
discuss even indirectly a single detail 
of the campaign. I recall that during 
the conversation had at that time, Mr. 
King, in answer to a question as to 
how must it had cost the friends of 
Senator Townsend, whose campaign 
Mr. King had managed, said it had 
cost approximately $20,000; and added 
that in view of the situation then ex- 
isting in Michigan, he thought it would 
cost my friends approximately $50,000 
to make a comprehensive and success- 
ful campaign. 

“I did not solicit or expend, direct- 
ly or indirectly, one single dollar in 
the campaign for senator in Michigan 
in 1918, nor did I know of the contri- 
butions made until afterward. 2 
two statements which I made und 
oath to the senate are absolutely and 
wholly true. The frst is dated August 
14, 1918, and, omitting the printed 
form with.which you are all familiar, 
and to which I sincerely subscribed, I 
wrote in my Own hand as follows: 

The campaign for my nomination 
for United States senator has been vol- 
untarily conducted by my friends in 
Michigan. I have taken no part in it 
whatever, and no contributions or ex- 
penditures have been made with my 
knowledge or consent.’ 

Conduct of Campaign. 

„After our interview in New York, 
Mr. King went back to Michigan and 
prosecuted a campaign, conducting it 
entirely in his own way. He managed 
a campaign of publicity and organiza- 
tion whicn was most effective, and for 
which I have frequently expressed to 
him the gratitude which I feel. 
Not more than a half dozen times did 
I see Mr. King throughout the cam- 
paign and each time it was in the city 
of New York. He kept me constantly 
informed as to the progress of the cam- 
paign in which I was, of course, keen- 
ly interested. . . . On one or two oc 
cations questions of policy were dis- 
cussed between us, and in each in- 
stance the judgment of Mr. King con- 
trolled... . 

“I knew, as a matter of fact, that 
a campaign of publicity was being ex- 
tensively carried on, and I realized 
that such a campaign must necessarily 
cost a considerable sum of money: 
but I did not have the faintest idea 
as to the a of money that ac- 
tually was expended until after the re- 
‘port was made public. The cost of 
the campaign was about $195,000, ac- 
cording to the report, and when I 
learned of this amount I was at once 
filled with astonishment and regret. 


“The amount expended was large.

Sudden Tnteréat’ of G. O. ö 


P. in Soldier Bonus Leg- 
islation Forced by Party 


= Weakening. 


* 


* 


a 


a 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 
Constitution Bureau. 
. Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, January 9.— (By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.) —In the des- 
perate attempt of the republican party, 
ow personally led by the president, to 
retrieve from its earlier position of 
almost bitter opposition to any kind of 
a soldier bonus, or to the land-settling 
suggestion of the late Franklin K. 
Lane,the announcement was unofficial- 


ly. made today that the plan for a sol- 
dier bonus would be worked out and! 


* enacted within the next 60 days. Re- 


ae 


publican leaders have been almost 
stampeded in their alarm at the (on- 


sequences of their earlier position, and 


their utter failure to rally to any con- 


, structive soldier bill to this hour. 


The present movement, therefore, is 
only a part of the republican con- 
gressional campaign program forced 
by the rapidly-receding republican tide. 

In this connection a statement ré 
ceived in Washington today from the 
soldiers’ settiement board of Canada 
states that 27,00 Canadian soldiers 
have been settled on farms by the 
Canadian government and $85,000,000 
have been loaned to these men by their 


government. 


Canadian Experience. 

“Aggregated roughly, this means 
that we have placed a population of 
125,000 people on these lands,“ the 
Statement said. 

Our settlers have been settled part- 
ly on free crown lands and partly on 
land purchased by this board and re- 
sold to them. In no case has a séttler 
been required to possess more tnan 
5500. We have, theerfore, advanced 
practically the full purchase price of 
the lands we have bought, and, in ad- 
dition, have advancel up to $3,000 for 
permanent improvements, such as 


*, buildings, fencing, etc., and stock and 


equipment. 

The risk is necessarily great, but 
“has been taken largely as a re-estab- 
lishment venture. 

Results Great. 

“We have been in operation . over 
three years, and the national results 
are already very great. Some 600,000 


| acres that were previously raw and 


entirely uncultivated, have been 
brought under cultivation. Last year 
soldier settlers produced field crops 
worth easily $16,000,000, to which 
nust be added the value of the increase 
in stock and the value of poultry and 
dairy products. 

“Out of the $85,000,000 already ex- 
pended, $10,000,000 has been returned 
to the public treasury. Of due pay- 
ments, more than YU per cent was 


aid, 
“Thus far the number of men who 
have abandoned their efforts repre- 
wents 7 per cent of our aggregate set- 
tlement In the case of abandonment, 
and despite the collapse in markets, 
we have salvaged and foreclosed more 
than 500 cases representing an in- 
vestment of more than $2,000,000. 
without any financial loss.“ 


Officials Searching 
For Missing Son 
Of George T. Clement 


Savannah, Ga., January 9.—(Spe- 
cial.) —Savannah officials are search- 


ing for Mark Clement, son of George 


. Clément, of Pittsburg, Pa., presi- 
dent of the Pittsburg Gas and Electric 
company, who lett home last October 
in company with an English sailor 
named “Poole.” The plot for a Mark 
Twain story may develop in the case. 

Information today from Paris 
island was that a Mark “O.” Clement 
is a marine there, but this young 
man declined to confirm the * 
that he is the Pittsburg boy. ‘he 
aris island Clements was married in 
Savannah a few days ago and his 
young wife is in a hospital here. He 
will visit her tomorrow and officers 
will endeavor to ascertain if he is 
the son of the Pennsylvania corpora- 
tion head.

sey the Colonel 
Makes Discovery 


Believes Jaybird Will Save 
Farmers Many. Thou- 
sands of Dollars. 


— 


BY COL. JEFFERSON S. MILLS. 


Decatur, Ga,, January 9.)—S {a 
cial. )—Carey brought 2, 
pounds of dressed pork to town today, 
which was raised with scarcely any 
expense. 

His method of raising and fattening 
hogs was as follows: Having seletced 
a tavorable spot in the woods, he put 
up a few cross arms on some oak 
trees, and bored two or three augur 
holes in each at a spot frequented by 
jay birds. 

The jaybirds, undertaking to lay in 
a winter supply of food, would insert 
an acorn in the augur hole and, in 
doing this, would push the acorn 
through into the hog pen below. 


Marvelous Economy. 


The birds were indefatigable work- 
ers, and aun immense amount of acorns 
were thus gathered with no expense 
at all. 

This apppears tobe a new and sim- 
ple discovery in providing means for 
raising meat, ont only for home con- 
sumption, btu for the market, and car- 
rying out a spirit of unsélfishnes, of- 
fers the suggestion to the public for 
what it is worth. 

There is only oned rawback to the 
method discovered by Mr. gin. 


{Mhere will be some expense attached 


to the hiring of a watchman to keep 
fowlers away from the secret of opera- 
tions, but a boy will answer for this 
purpose, and in a very short time the 
jaybirds will become almost domsti- 
cated. 

Opens Way to Experiments. 

In this discovery, a very profitable 
avenue is opened for experiment by 
farmers not only in DeKalb, but in 
habitat the jaybird all over the coua- 
try. 

hes further information address 
Carey Reagin, Lithonia, Ga., enclosing 
2 cents for spotasge and 10 cents for 
expense of secretary's salary.

Too Much for Macon 
Mounted Lieutenant 


Macon, Ga., January 9.—(Special.) 
Lieutenants of police ia Macon are

wigned horses some days ago for n.oult-

B 0 12YEAR TEN 


ton superior court, Monday, sentenced 
Claude A. West, former executive sec- 
retary to three governors, to serve 
from six to twelve years in the peni- 
tentiary, after West had entered a 
plea of guilty to one indictment. for 
forgery and another charging larceny 
after trust. 

Two other indictments, one charg- 
ing forgery and the Other larceny 
after trust, still pending against the 
former secretary, were expected to 
be nol-prossed by Solicitor-General 
John A. Boykin, although no an- 
nouncement as to this was made in 
court, 

West was checked up short to the 
extent of about $15, after his re- 
tirément from office. Sentence on the 
larceny after trust was from two to 
five years’ imprisonment. On the 
forgery charge the sentence was from 
four to seven years. The sentences 
were not to be served concurrently. 

The forgery indictment on which 
West was sentenced was for the in- 
dorsement of a check for $2,484.66, 
drawn by the state treasurer, W. J. 
Speer, to the order of S. C. Groover. 
The indictment was returned October 
18, 1921, the pers being committed 
May 21, 1919 

The en after trust indictment 
was returned last Friday, charging 
the misapyropriation of $1, in in- 
surance money paid on policies cov- 
ering buildings at the state prison 
farm which were burned. 


Before sentence was passed _At- 
torneys John Y. Smith and Verlyn 
Moore spoke briefly in testimony of 
West’s general good character and 
asked the leniency or the court. 


Judge Humphries, however, said 
that in his opinion the sentence should 
be severe enough not only to impress 
the defendant with the seriousness 
of his offense in serie ere with the 
state’s money, but also to serve as a 
warning that might possibly deter 
— from making a similar mis- 
ake 


The state was represented by At- 
torney-General George Napier and So- 
licitor-General Jolin A. Boykin, while 
West was reperesented by Attorneys 
Walter A. Sims and Joel B. Mallett.

tee will be held again at 12:30 Tues-

board of directors at its next meeting:

Balls Wednesday 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 


Washington, anuary 9.— (By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.) — The senate, 
under an agreement already reached by 
unanimous consent, will cake up Wed- 


providing tor the issuance of miseuge 
books by raiuroad companies. Among 
the bills is one ntrodu@ed by Senator 
Harris, of Georg a, last April, direct- 
ing che interstate commerce cummis- 
sion “to provide a system of inter- 
changeable books of not less than 
1000 miles each and to direct their 
sule to the public at a rate of 33 1-2 
percentum less than the regula: pas- 
senger fare rates by all raliroads op- 
trating an interstate passenger serv- 
ice.” 

Hearings were held on the Harris 
bill, as weil as bills by Senator Wat- 
son, of Indiana, and Senator Mekel- 
lar, but the legislation was not favor- 
ably reported. Just before the Chrisi- 
mas’ holidays. Senator Robinson, of 
Arkansas, secured an agreemert for 


ation of the bill by Senator Watsen, 
who is a member of the interstate 
commerce committee. It provides for 
books of 5,000 miles, to be sald at 
2 1-2 cents a mile. One objecticn by 
ecme lawyers had been raised on the 
Watson bil! as being unconstitutiona! 
because of setting a certain rate. The 
Harris bill directs a percentage cost 
for the book, based on the regular 
tares. 

The constitutionality of the legisla- 
iton is expec: ed to enter into the dis- 
cussion in the -senate when the bills 
dome up, as tue so-called M.chigan 
case on mileage books, decided by the 
supreme court. bas held congress with- 
out the authority to pass such legisla- 
ion. 


SUSPECT JAILED 
IN LONG BEACH | 
WANTED BY U. S. 


Steps to identify the man under 
arrest at Long Beach, Cal., as a 
bunco suspect, as announced exclusive- ä 
ly in The Constitution Sunday, will 
be made at once, according to an- 
nouncement Monday by Clint W. 
Hager, United States distriet attorney, 
after Long Beach authorities had been 
ordered to hold the man, thought to 
be Charlie McCord, wanted here by 
the state and government. 

Telegraphic messages stated that the 
prisoner had used the name of James 
A. Sloane, alleged bunco man who 
forfeited a 57.500 bond recently 
through failure to appear for trial, 
but officials are inclined to believe 
the man held is McCord, and that he 
had only assumed the name of the 
other bunco man temporarily.

WAIT ON HARDING! 


BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 
Constitution Bureau, 
Raleigh Hotel. 

Washington, January 9.— (By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.) —It develops 
today that ali action on the numerous 
marine measures now pending in con- 
! gress will be suspended until President 
Harding sends his promised ship sub- 
sidy messa to congress early in 
February. In the meantime a strong 
tide is running in arms conference eir- 
cles for an international conference 
shortly on merchant marine and trans- 
oceanic shipping. 

When the wishes of the adminis- 
tration are made public there will be 
a realignment of forces on shipping 
questions, with a move on the part 
of the republican chiefs to revise dor- 
mant bills te conform to the general 


program outlined by the executive. 


Shipping men who are in close touch 
with sentiment im congress foresee a 
keen fight on some of the direct sub- 
sidy features if the board and the 
president follow the recommendations 
| made by the merchant marine joint 
committee, composed of owners, build- 
ers and operators. 

Fight on Subsidy Due. 

There will be a keen fight on the 
provisions for a direct subsidy. The 
willingness of congress to help the 
merchant marine has been demonstrat- 
ed on many occasions, and has been 
one of the planks of the republican 
platform for many years. The strength 
of this sentiment was shown in the 
enactment of the merchant marine 
act, known as the Jones law. 

The purpose of the administration 
now, as indicated, is to go much fur- 
ther than the Jones act, with its pro- 
visions for indirect aid, and to ask 
congress for large payments in cash. 
It is considered certain that this will 
precipitate a strong contest, with the 
result far from assured. 

At present there are three sources 
of opposition in congress which are 
receiving the attention of advocates 
of shipping measures. The first is 
the belief of some members that the 
dormant features of the Jones act 
should be inforced before further ex- 
periments are made. Second is the 
constant antagonism of important 
sections of the country, especially 
those remote from the seaboard, to 
cash appropriations for shipping. And 
the third is the reaction against the 
shipping industry which has grown up 
within the last few days as a result

ments have porwr hoes its work. This 


passed the senate by a substantial ma- 
jority over the opposition of the pres- 
ident. There is strong sentiment for 
its support in the house. 

o action has yet been taken by 
the ‘ieee merchant marine commit- 
tee on the bill introduced by Kepre- 
sentative Burton to repeal section 34 
of the Jones act, as requested by the 
president, It is understood that the 
committee will take no steps until the 
views of the president have been out- 
lined further. 


1921 TAX. PAYMENTS 
BETTER THAN IN 1920 


A comparative statement of collec- 
tions of taxes for the year 1921 and 


for 1920 show over a quarter of « mil- 
lion more has been collected for 1921, 
according to a statement made Monday 
night by W. S. Richardson, state and 
county tax. collector. 

Mr. Richardson stated tha‘ the 
showing made by his office so far was 
excellent, and more than $2,300,000 
has already been collected. He urged 
all those who have not paid their 
taxes for the past year to remit the 
amounts immediutely. ‘

ATLANTA FEDERAL 
PRISON CHAPLAIN 
DIES IN BOSTON 


Norwich, Mich., January 9.— Word 
came here this afternoon of the 
death in 4a Boston hospital today 
of Rev. Michael J. Byrne, 64 years 
old, chaplain of the federal peni- 
tentiary at Atlanta, Ga. He under- 
went a surgical operation. Mr. Byrne 
had been at the penitentiary for six 
years. 


Rev. Byrne had been Catholic 
chaplain at the loca. federal prison 
for about six years and was held in 
high esteem by prisoners and afficials 
alike. His home is in Norwich, Conn., 
and he is survived by a daughter, Miss 
Bessie Byrne, and a son, Dr. Joseph 
J. Byrne. He entered the priesthood 
several years after the death of his 
wife. He had been ill at St. Joseph’s 
infirmary for several months and 
went to Boston to stand the operation 
which resulted in his death. 


“Isn’t your new cook rather inclined 
to put on airs?” “Perhaps,” replied 
Mrs. Crosslots wearily. Lou see, her 
husband is an affluent bootlegger, 


while mine merely works on a salary.”

close of the first complete rehearsal

at the Auditorium on January 1 and 
18. The preliminary drilling of each 
man in his individual part had been 
completed, the soloists had * Igarned 


their songs, and the chorus had every 
song down pat, so that the first com- 
plete rehearsal was a big success, and 
demonstrates how a company of skill- 
ed amateurs may be quickly prepared 
to do parts under the direction. of an 
experienced producer. 

Four of the principal blackface 
comedians and singers will be Wylie 
West, Potentate yne Gibson, Dr. 
Claude N. Hughes and Frank A. Cun- 
dell, while Bert Adams will perform in 
the difficult position of interlocutor, 
for which he is particularly gifted. 
Other prominent members of Yaarab 
Temple are assigned to solos and 
blackface parts in the minstrels, 
while others will display their his- 
trionie ability in the laughable club 
scene on which the curtain rises. 

Tickets will be placed on sale Tues- 
day in many drug stores, soda and 
cigar stands, Shrine headquarters and 
other public places, while any Shriner 
can procure you tickets, the public of 
Atlanta being invited to attend and 
see what a good show the Shriners 
of Yaarab Temple can put on. The 
tickets are $1 each, being good for 
either performance. The curtain will 
go up promptly at 8:15 p. m., and 
there will be no reserved seats. 


ALLEGED DOG DEAL 
BRINGS ATLANTAN 
INTO FEDERAL NET 


Following his arrest shortly after 
noon Monday in his office at 403 Wes- 
ley Memorial building, W. H. Giles, 
formerly of Clarksdale, Miss., will 
leave Atlanta today in custody of

ordinary dogs as thoroughbreed am- 
mals.

ublication work since coming to At- 
anta. He is also said to have worked

greed dogs, and that instead of filling 
his orders properly, shipped dogs that 
had no selling value.

rose, will be a siring in Ma the —

mary for the nomination. . 

Mr. Pepper's announcement, coupled 
with a statement. by the governor that 
he expected-Mr. Pepfor to be a candi- 
date for the come. te term, ended 
speculation as to whether Mr. Sproul 
would himself run fer, the office this 
year. The governor's statement came 
as a surprise to some of his friends. 
He had the unprecedented opportunity 
of having been twice in a position to 
resign thé governorship to take the 
senatorship, first through the death of 
Senator Knox and then by the passing | 
of Senator Penrose. It had been ex- 
pected in some quarters that he would 
be a candidate for senator and, if elect- 
ed, take the seat after his term of of- 
fice exyared next January. 

Mr. Pepper, in a statement, said 
the tender of the senatorship had 
been made without any restriction, ex- 
press or implied, upon his freedom of. 
choice respecting his term of service. 

The governor in his announcement 
asked for full support for Mr. Pepper 
“in the hope that he may remain in 
the senate and be given an opportunity 
to render superb service.” 

Mr. Pepper left for Washington to- 
night and will be sworn in tomorrow.

Arrest of Employées 
Of Car Company Due 
To Misunderstanding 


Officials of the Georgia Railway 
and Power company explained Monday 
night that the arrest Monday morning 
of employees engaged in digging a 
manhole at Auburn avenue and Ivy 
street, came about as the result of a 
misunderstanding of the preliminaries 
preceding the work. 

The arrests were made by J. T. 
Dorsett, superintendent of streets in 
the city construction department, after 
the foreman of the excavating crew 
refused, it is said, to obey his orders 
to stop, although informed by Dorsett 
that the company had not received 
authority from the city to make the 
excavation. Dorsett carried the crew 
of nine men to police headquarters. 

When the misunderstanding was 
explained to Chief of Construction 
H. L. Collier he sent a letter to 
Recorder Johnson requesting that the 
charges against the men be dismissed, 
and issued a permit allowing the work 
to go on. 


Having passed the age limit of 40 
years, Jimmy Potts, the veteran Min- 
neapolis battler, has been barred by 
the Minnesota commission from box- 
ing in that state.

HOW 10 GET RID 
UF CATARRH 


A Simple, Safe, Inexpen- 


Out the Head, Nose and 
Throat. 


There is no disease more cffensive 
or disagreeable, or no disease that will 
iead to as much serious trouble as ca- 
tarrh. You can now get rid of it by a 
simple, safe, pleasant home remedy 
discovered by Dr. Blosser, a catarrh 
specialist. 

Dr. Blosser’s Remedy is composed of 
nedieinal herbs, flowers and berries, 
which you smoke in a dainty pipe or} 
cigarette. The smoke-vapor is in- 


haled into all the air passages of the 


head, nose, throat and lungs and car- 
ries ’ medicine where sprays, douches 
and ointments cannot possibly reach. 
Its effect is soothing and healing and 
is entirely harmless. It contains no cu- 
bebs or tobacco, and may be used by 
women and children as well as men. 

If you suffer from catarrh, asthma, 
catarrhal deafness, or if subject to fre- 
quent colds, you should try this rem- 
edy. Satisfactory results guaranteed 

Dr. Blosser’s Remedy may be had 
at any well stocked drug store: or if 
you desire proof of its beneficial and 
pleasant effect, and ten cents (coin or 
stamps) to The Blosser Co., 25 DD,

Emory Woman's 
Club Meets. 


The Emory Woman’s club held its 
regular monthly meeting Thursday, 
January 5, at the residence of Mrs. 
W. A. Candler, 548 Ponce de Leon 
avenue. 

There was a short business meet- 
ing at which the program committee 
presented a tentative program of the 
coming year’s meetings. It was de- 
cided that a call meeting be held for 
further discussion of this matter on 
Tuesday, January 17, at the theolog- 
ical building, at 3 o’clock. Everyone

thy to Mrs. Parker, who, is ill at Wes- 
ley Memorial hospital.

the president, Mrs. Plato Durham, in- 
troduced Judge Williams, dean of the 
Emory law school, who gave a delight- 


fully informal talk on phases of his 


recent trip to western England and 
Wales. 

On account of the coal strike rail- 
road service was uncertain and the 
motor bus system from town to town 
is. very popular, giving one a much 
more intimate view of the country. 
Judge Williams was particularly 
struck with the beauty of the flowers 
and disappointed in the women of Eng- 


land. He states that England is in a 


very bad condition. An wunuusual 
drought made all the fields brown and 
cut short all the crops. Taxes are 
very excessive and many of the old es- 
tates are being sold. Old libraries and 
furniture are being placed on the mar- 
ket everywhere, Yet the people are 
pleasure mad there, as here. Theaters, 
hotels, and resorts are crowded with 
pleasure seekers. The middle classes 
are supplanting the aristocracy every- 
where. 2 

At the close of this delightful lec- 
ture the meeting was turned over to 
the hostesses, Mesdames Candler, 
Sledd, Fitts and Best, and a social.

A “balanced diet” may sound 
confusing to many people 


The facts, as explained 
here, are simple. 


The secret of a “balanced diet” is to have food

The outstanding event of the

ters, Peachtree Arcade, was the elec- 
tion of Mra. Ernest C. Kontz to the

tion of Mrs. Kontz followed the resig- 
nation of Mrs. K. G. Matheson, who

ber future home in Philadelphia, Pa., 


that her desire to have her successor

Today! Sale of 43,000. Yards of 20c to 50c

One of the largest manufacturers of Valenciennes in the country had a 
surplus of 3,648 dozen, or 43,000 yards, of laces. He made us an offer. If we 
would take every yard he had he would let us have them at a loss, to be 
exact, at such a price that we could sell them for 12%c a yard. 


—There are Calais, Ruby and French 
Valenciennes edges, insertions and galoons 
in widths from I to 5 inches. 
_of the prettiest patterns we have ever seen! 
You may buy by the yard or by the dozen 
yards. 


—43,000 yards! It seemed a big order, 
but we did not hesitate. For we knew 
that spring and summer are not far off 
and that the women of Atlanta will be 
themselves in the making of 
nty lingerie, light frocks for them- 
selves and children’s clothes. Yard 
ard of laces will be used to 


these things.

That Game Is Never Worth the Candle 
If murder had been done she would

As it is, she has much misery and 
wretchedness and many bitter memo- 
ries to live down. I wonder if it was 
worth it? No that’s wrong—I don't 
r at all. 
That game is never worth the can- 


That woman told me that she would 
giadly give ten years of her life if she 


back to the days when sbe 
t that the man was some- 
her and tried to 


fork of the road. 
1 Think She Would. 

It is easy when you are 35 to say 
that you would give ten years off your 
life. Tou fancy those years as 
ing the years from 80 to 90 and who 
wants to live over 80 anyway (who, 
indeed, except the person who is 80 
and wants it very poignantly). Nev- 
ertheless, I believe this woman really 
would pay the price, so bitter is her 
realization of her mistake today. 

There are some men and women who 
always have that uneasy wish to try 
their powers, but to the more normal 
nerson it is more apt to come between 
the ages of 30, say, and 50. They 
want te see if they can’t do it just 
once more. And they do it and then 
be with all their hearts that they 
had not. 


Vanity, Not Love. 

Of course there are such things as 
genuine affinities, powerful attractions 
that make themselves irresistibly felt. 
But to everyone of these I think there 
are ten thousand of the “I-just-wanted- 
to see if I could make him like me af- 
fairs. 

Vanity, not love, is at the root of 
them. Bitterness, not joy, is their 
flower. If you are tempted to see 
what you can do. look at the whole 
thing squarely and you will see how 
small the possible gain is and how very 
large the loss, and you may save your- 
self from wishing some day that you 
could give ten years of your life to 
take the other fork. 


Tomorrow—lIt Isn't Fair But It's 
Life.

The uninvited guest at meals is not 
a friend; real friend would think 
of coming unasked, or without tele- 
phoning. It is the grossest rudeness 
to visit the house of a mere acquaint- 
ance at mealtimes, taking advantage 
of the old law of hospitality which 
always made room for one more at the 


table. That law belonged to a time 


when traveling was difficult, and 
when the accident of unexpected com- 
pany might happen in any house, 
where, moreover, capacious storerooms 
and linen rooms held provisions for 
any emergency. 

No such conditions exist today, and 
the hostess who greets the uninvited 
guest need not follow the old rule 
unless she chooses. It is quite per- 
missible to give the visitor a magazine 
to read in the living room until the 
meal is finished, or, at most, to send 
tea and cake to her on a tray.

As Jeanne is starting for a dinner

He informs Jeanne that he can bor- 
row nothing on her worthless land. 

Selby North, gossiping. e'derly 
bachelor, tells Jeanne of Barsiowe’s ,

and meets Adele Parkinson, to whom 
Jeanne presents him as a busincss ac-

Canby offers a market tip“ as a 
means for Jeanne to make some 
money. 

She arranges the party so that 
she drives to the Forbes’ i: Bar-

with a man named Farnham. 

At the dance that night Jeanne, 
using indifference to bait Barstowe, 
succeeds in angering him. .

VERA 
TRIUMPHANT. 

If Barstowe was unusually quiet 
during the remainder of the Forbes’ 
week-end party, Jeanne was the one 
guest who appeared not to. notice it. 
She rode with Canby and “hiked” with 
North and went motoring with Jim 
Farnham. Between times she gos- 
siped wih Adele Parkinson and Vera 
Dayton—or rather listened to their 
gossip, her silent, grave-eyed gaze 
turning from one to the other as they 
discussed, criticised and otherwise 
conversationally mauled the other 
guests and even their host and hostess. 

“Little spitfire!“ Mrs. Parkinson 
confided to Jeanne on one occasion 
when Vera Dayton left them to an- 
swer a phone call. “I adore egging 
her on! It’s wicked of me, but 1 


ness these days!’’ she sighed. 

Jeanne smiled. 

“You certainly have histrionic abil- 
ity. I could have taken oath that you 
meant all the cutting things you said 
about the Forbes’ uests.“ 

Adele lauhed and stretched lazily on 
her comfortable couch. 

An playing the social game, my child, 
the best adage to follow is the old one 
about the Romans. It will save you 
from making fatal mistakes. And I 
don’t mean that literally; I mean it

Dayton, she will immediately conceiv 

the idea that you have some persona

and his millions. I frankly own that 
I would, but it looks—” 

She broke off and regarded Jeanne 
speculatively, through half-clozed eyes. 

“It looks,” she continued slowly, “as 
though you were going to draw the 
plum.” ‘3 | 

Jeanne's heart leaped and she felt 
herself. flushing. 

“How ridiculous!” she scoffed, 
laughingly. “Why, I hardly know Mr. 
Barstowe! He's been nice, but—of 


course, he’s a clever flirt—Mr. North 


told me.” 

Adele sat up energetically. 

„If you take my advice, you'll inter- 
pret in the reverse everything Selby 
North says! Old gossip! He’s worse 
than Vera Dayton. . Til tell 
you one thing, if it will pleasé your 
vanity, I never saw Vic Barstowe act 
this way about any girl before. He's 
always been the essence of good-hu- 
mored indifference; he could be de- 
pended on for that merry smile of his, 
and a shrug of his big shoulders—but 
for the last two days he’s been—jmpos- 
sible! Sulky and grouchy and irrita- 
ble! Vic, of all people! Everyone's 
noticed it, particualrly your little 
friend, Vera.” j 

Jeanne’s pulse was racing. 

So? She hadn’t lost in that blind 
gamble! Indifference was the trick 
after all! She had been afraid. As 
two days passed with Barstowe avoid- 
ing her pointedly beyond a courteous 
greeting, when their proximity de- 
manded, her heart had sunk with the 
foreboding that she had gone a step 
too far in her careless treatment of 
him that first night of the Forbes’ 
party. But now, if Adele Parkinson 
was right 

„Is Miss Dayton in love with Mr. 
Barstowe?” she asked, more to divert 
the channel of Adele’s thought than 
for real information. Anyone who 
wasn’t blind could see that the Day- 
ton girl wore her heart on her sleeve. 

Mrs. Parkinson nodded, picking out 
a bonbon from the box at her elbow. 

„Always has been. Always will be 
unless he marries her. They: were 
raised together, you know,” she ex- 
ylained. Vera's parents have a coun- 
try place adjoining the Barstowe's. 
They played together as kiddies. It’s 
always been understood the two fami- 
lies that they’d marry when they grew 


up and had had their fling a bit. Bar- 
stowe, Senior, and Vic’s mother favor 
the match un much for the 
doting parents of an only gon who will 
inherit a great fortune. 


ary 
stowe is insane about family. The 
girl Vie marries—if it isn’t Vera Day- 
ton—will have to come with a 
load of superior 5 trees and a 
eal chart a mile long before 
ve the lodgekeeper the sign to 
‘the gate.” 


She spoke jestingly, but her eyes, as |< 


she regarded her BP are vis-a-vis, were 
grave. It seemed to Jeanne that they 
voiced an anspoken question: Had she 
such a pedigree to offer? 

Jeanne, thinking of Aunt Emily and 
her father, who had kept the village 
drug store, and their forbears who 
sprang, so far as any record chronicled, 
direct from the red soil of Iowa, hon- 
est, hardworking, God-fearing, uiddle- 
class, suppressed a smile. 

Her eyes went unconsciously to the 
mirror set in the wall opposite as if 
they expected to find some branding 
mark on her own reflection. But 
what she saw was a slimly beautiful 
girl with an aristocratic face, with 
slender white hands that bore no signs 
of toil, and with ankles a duchess 
would have envied. 

She was a far cry to Aunt Emily! 
No one would telieve her if she ad- 
mitted such a heritage. How easy it 


would be to manufacture a line of an- 


cestry worthy of even Mrs. Barstowe's 
respect! She had faked her position, 
her finances, her education and trav- 
el—what was one more twisting of the 


truth against the achievement of her 


greatest ambition! 

Vera Dayton came back just then, 
her face darkened by a frown, 

“So stupid! That was mother on 
the phone. She has just had a wire- 
less for me from the Aquintania—it’s 
bringing an old school friend from 
Paris and she’s never been to New 
York before and doesn’t know where 
to stop, so I'll have to go meet the 
boat and drag her home. Isn': that 
too provoking? And I was baving 
such a nice time, too!” 


“Cheer up, my dear,” Adele consoled 


her laughingly. “Your going will make 
Vie miss you and that is a wholesome 
state for willful young men.” sae 

“Oh, I'll make Vic drive me in,” 
Vera assured her brightly. “I must 
run and tell him before he goes off 
for a tramp.” 

Adele made a grimace after her re- 
treating back. 

“Poor Vic! But III wager he 
doesn't go,” she added with a smile at 
Jeanne. 

Adele lost her bet. Half an hour 
later Barstowe's long blue car glided 
out of the Forbes’ drive with Vera 
Dayton triumphantly beside him. 

Two of my party have failed me,” 
sighed Alicia Forbes, looking after the 
retreating car. Mr. Barstowe wont 
be back, either. He said he had to be 
n town early tomorrow, anyway. 

Vera had taken the trick after all, 
thcught Jeanne, as she dressed dis- 
spiritedly for dinner.

It arrived in the autumn. It was 


made of silk beaver, and was trim- 
med with a broad black ribbon. It 
had a companion if not a counterpart 
in the high-crowned, narrow-brimmed 
silk hat which the smart French- 
women wore as soon as October be- 
gan. In America, the saflor took bet- 
ter than the 1870 shape, for we were

more familiar with it. It had been 
immortalized by our own Gibson into 
a national fashion. It was associated 
with a certain epoch in our dressing, 
and it carried our English name for 
it. Two summers ago one of our mil- 
liners tried in vain to reinstate it. 

As the new spring hats appear to 
have their first showing at the places 
where the sun shines hot, one sees 
that the shape is to be retained in 
straw. The present day edition is 
more ornate than the kind of twenty 
years ago, for it often has a facing of 
some colored silk and a crown band 
that carries pasted roses made of silk 
or embroidery. 

The French hats are of dark blue 
straw, strange to say, for the color 
has been in popular usage over there 
for two years, but in such hats there 
is so much attention drawn from the 
straw itself by the onamental band 
and the lining that it is well a safe 
and sound foundation color is chosen. 
Often the ribbon around the crown 
is of heavy velvet and none of the 
milliners hesitate to use one of those 
flowered, luxurious ribbons that the 
dressmakers have kept to themselves. 
Some of them remind you of the Vic- 
torian bell-pulls that hung by the side 
of the ornate mantels, gay embroidered 
things such as were featured in The 
Gay Lord Quex“ when Hare delight- 
ed Americans with it. No audience 
failed to notice that bell-pull in the 
thrilling third act. 

White straw sailor hats for Florida 
have their brims lined with mauve or 
red or jade green crepe de chine or 
taffeta; the silk is considered better 
and the bands which ‘match in color 
are striped, checkerboard or gaily em- 
bossed with flowers. 

Ribbon is frequently used on the 
new informal hats, but whether it 
will have success, only the public can 
decide. The method of its arranging 
is not always pleasing nor gracious, 
to judge by the hats we have seen 
in this country. Our milliners may 
find something better than the hard 
corrugated tubes, the exaggerated bows 
with ends. Ribbon is not a soft adfunct 
to the face. It is better when sepa- 
rated from the eyes and chin by other 
fabric, even straw. : 

The milliners are trying to interest 
the public away from the fabric hat 
to that of straw. Possibly the indus- 
tries direct this appeal. Since the

of the draped fabric hat it pe 
difficult to make women 
in the blocked 7 
must stay as it wns a rs 
which is likely to break and fs 
sunburn. The horsehair 
was the fashionable thin

son to suppose that it will be popula

THE HOUSEHOLD 


Edited by Anne Rittenhouse’ 


REFRESHMENT SALADS, — 


It is a fact that nine men out 
ten prefer some sort of salad wi 
sandwiches and chocolate or cof 
for evening refreshments to the d 
ventional “ice-créam-and-cake” 
freshments that over satisfy the swee 
tooth and are far more likely to dis 
turb the digestion than a salad. Ang 
in these days when lettuce and othe 
salad greens can be had at smallfex 
pense all times of the year these dishe 
are not difficult to concoct. Here 
some suggestions: 

Frozen Fruit Salad. „ 

Melt one tablespoon of butter an 
add the yolks of two eggs slight 
beaten, and three and one-half ‘tabdfe 
spoons of flour mixed with three t 
blespoons of sugar, one teaspoonge 
salt, one-third teaspoon of — 
and a few grains of cayenne. Ad 
gradually, while stirring constantly 
two-thirds of a cup of milk and one 
third cup of vinegar. Cook in doybl 
boiler, stirring constantly until ‘ 
ture thickens, the time required bein 
about ten minutes. Remove fron 
boiler, beat two minutes, and set asic 
to cool. Cut candied cherries in s 
pieces, there should be one-fourtyh 0 
a cup, and add one taliespoon of ‘lem 
on juice. ..Add one-fourth cup each o 
orange pulp, canned slicéd pineappl 
cut in small cubes, and banana cut ir 
small pieces. Add prepared fruit t 
first mixture, then add one-half eu 
of heavy cream beaten until stiff an 
two tablespoons pineapple juice. Pa 
in a briek mold to overflow, adjus 
cover, pack in salt and ice, using ; 
parts, and let stand ‘two — We 
move from mold, cut in slices an¢ 
serve on lettuce leaves. 

Onion and Tomato Salad. - 

Mince half a Bermuda onion an@ 
little sweet green pepper. Put 
teaspoon on each thick slice of ripe to 
mato, and put each slice of tomato or 
a little bed of crisp lettuce leave 
Pour French dressing over all. 

Chicken and Tuna Salad. 7 

Tuna is less expensive than chicken 
and blends nicely with it. Mix on 
can of tuna with a cup of diced, chic 
en, one tablespoon of diced pimegic 
and two tablespoons of chopped olive 
or cucumber or celery according to 
season. Use mayonnaise dressing ane 
serve on lettuce. 


Pineapple Salads. 

Canned pineapple can be used™4 
different ways to make delicious r 
freshment salads. If you like ere 
a little roquefort cheese with crean 
and when you have laid the slices o 
pineapple on lettuce leaves fill 
center of each with the creamed roqr 
fort cheese. Slices of pimento may t 
used in combination with cream cheese 
with pineapple. Candied cherries 
look well and taste good with pj 
apple.

“E. S. BALDWIN, 
“Clerk Superior Court.” 


Thus reads the official order appoint- 


ing Mrs. O. L. Anderson, of city, 
as judge of the newly-created jyvenile 
court tor this counnty—the first wom- 
an to be appointed to such an office 
in Georgia. 

The appointment of Mrs. Anderson 
was as much in the nature of a sur- 
prise to her, she states, as it was to 
the general public here. Very few 
people had given serious thought te 
the creation of such a court, and 
hardly enough interest had been mani- 
fested to justify speculation upon pos- 
sible appointees. The appointment, 
however, is highly satisfactory, and 
the creation of the court meets with 
general approval, and will fill a well- 
defined need in this county. 

Mrs. Anderson, or “JudgeAnder- 
son,“ as she will soon become known— 
a woman of striking personality and 
personal charm, high educational qual- 
ifications and strong character—is 
president of the local organization of 
the W. C. T and is chairman 
of the prison committee“ of the Mis- 
sionary society of the First Baptist 
church. In the first-named position 
the has had exceptional opportunities 
to study the evil influences of strong 
drink, particularly with reference to 
the young people, and has an abun- 
dance of information on this subject. 


Interest in Wayward Girls. 
In the latter-named position, she 
holds weekly services at the county 


jail, and pays frequent visits to 
prison camps in various sections of the 
county, where the members of the com- 
mittee talk to the prisoners, take an 
interest in them and help brighten the 
lives of those condemned for long 
terms of labor under “chaingaing”’ con- 
ditions. “Judge” Anderson has shown 
a marked interest in wayward girls 
and erring young men and women of 
this city and section for many years, 
and her motherly advice and straight- 
forward talks have borne good fruit 
upon more than one occasion. It is 
thought that her deep personal inter- 
est in, and activities toward, helping 
unfortnuate boys and girls influenced 
her appointment as judge of the juve- 
nile court. 

The newly-appointed judge has very 
strong opinions regarding the methods 
of correcting and punishing youngsters 
who violate the laws of the land and, 
in an interview with The Constitution 
representative today, declared that 
more harm than good can come from 
prison confinement and labors in a re- 
formatory as a method of punishment 
of the young boy or girl. Extreme 
measures should be resorted to only 
after probation, change of environment 
and living conditions have failed to 
accomplish their purposes. 

“In the rearing of my own five chil- 
dren—two sons and three daughters— 
I have applied the same principles 
which I expect to use in handling the 
cases of other mothers’ sons and 
daughters. Kindness, being positive 
and reasonable with the child and giv- 


ing it to understand that you believe 
that the act of wrong-doing was unin- 
tentional, and displaying a feeling of 
confidence in the integrity and charac-

ter of the child, will often accomplish 
what long periods of prison confine- 
ment, embarrassment and manual la 
bor, will not accomplish. 

Modern Customs. 

“I may be a bit old-fashioned in 
some ways,” said Mrs. Anderson, “but 
I believe many faults of the young 
element can be attributed more directly 
to what we are pleased to call ‘modern 
customs and usages,’ than to the will- 
ful intents of the child. Anyway, I 
am going to give them all a ‘chance,’ 
and when youngsters are haled before 


my court, I shall treat them as kindly 
and with as much lenience and pa- 
tience as it is possible under the eir · 
cumstances.” , 

Mrs. Anderson stated, in reply to a 
question, that she did not wish to dis- 
cuss the habits and acts of the present 
young generation, at this time, and 
would not be drawn outon the subject 
of dances, painting and bobbed hair, al- 
though admitting her “personal dis- 
like” of such things.

forty years old,” but declines positive-

splendid judicial appearance. She is 
a woman of boundless energy, and her 
eyes glow with the fires of enthusiasm 
and eager anticipation, when she talks 
of what “wonderful opportunities I 
will have to help the boys and girls of 
this county.” She isa native of Wilkin- 


son county and, prior to her marriage, 
was Miss nie Ogburn. Her family 
moved to Dublin in 1898, and she mar- 
ried O. L. Anderson a short while 
thereafter. Her husband is general 
agent of the Macon, Dublin and Sa- 
vannah railroad, but to use her own 
words, “he looks after the railroad’s 
interest, and I devote my spare time 
to aiding worthy boys and girls and 
influencing them toward the paths of 
righteousnes and good citizenship.” 

With all her natural fondness for 
children; her experiences in rearing a 
family of five healthy and wholesome 
boys and girls, her deep and self - 
sacrificing interest in the morals of 
the younger contingent, especially her 
wide knowledge of juvenile court pro- 
cedure and practices, Mrs. Anderson 
will wear the judicial ermine of the 
newly-created juvenile court in such a 
satisfactory manner as will refleet

DOWEL STICK 


~BRAD 


Rasso, one of the most widely 
known professional jugglers, has pre- 
pared a series of ten lessons in easy 
juggling especially for the readers of 
this newspaper. This is the eighth 
lesson. Another one next week. 

Cloth and Hat Spinning. 

It is more a matter of knowing the 

“secret” rather than, contrary to the 


opinion of the average audience, un- 
usual ability that will enable you to 
spin a cloth on the end of a stick 
just as you may have seen jugglers— 
Japanese jugglers, perhaps—do in the 
theater. 

Obtain a heavy piece of cloth about 
18 inches square. A table cover about 
the size will do if you have one and 
can persuade mother to allow you to 
use it. 

For a few cents you may purchase 
at the hardware shop a dowel stick 
about two feet long, which will serve 
as the spinning stick. In one end of 
At hammer a brad, allowing it to pro- 
ject about three-sixteenths of an inch. 

ut off the head and file the wire to 
a point. 


Starting the 0 : 
Hold the cloth up before you with 
our left hand, if you are right- 
anded. Grasp it in the middle of the 
top edge. With the dowel stick in 
the right hand, place the point with 
the brad in the lower left-hand cor- 
ner of the cloth. The nail should 

penetrate the cloth. See figure 1. 
With a quick, upward twist to the 
left of the right wrist, start the cloth 
ning. Rotate the stick with a 


nay swing around

stick an extra hard upward push, be- 
ing careful not to break the spinning 
of the cloth. 

Quickly withdraw the wire point 
from the cloth. The cloth will spin 
unsupported and, due to the force -of 
the push, will ascend. As it comes 
down put the stick into it again, but 
this time not so close to the edge, but 
nearer the center. See figure 2. 


Rotate Stick With Cloth. 

Continue the spinning. It will be 
easier now, because such a wide wrist 
movement is not necessary. 

Never allow the speed of the spin- 
ning stick to be less than that of the 
revolving cloth. The stick, because 
of the brad, is caught in the cloth, 
and if the stick does not rotate with 
the cloth it will tangle. 

Another equally effective stunt that 
is often seen on the stage is the spin- 
ning of a hator a stick. 

se a soft, round hat. Toss it into 
the air before you, making it spin. 
As it descends catch the brim on the 
side lightly with the spinning stick 
and give the hat an easy upward 
push. This will renew its spinning 
and cause it to ascend again. Each 
time it comes down catch the side 
of the brim with the stick and send 
the hat back up. | 

Next week I shall tell you how to 
pull a tablecloth off a table, fully set 
with dishes, without disturbing a one.

Sue BY GEORGE T. BYE 
Illustrated by Arlene Coyle 


Daniel Vorhees Howell, the distin- 
guished insurance counsel, strode 
gravely into a telegraph office in the 
state capital, drew a telegraph form 
from a rack in a writing desk, and 
began hastily to compose a message. 

Behind the counter, watching him 
with reund-eyed intentness, were two 
clerks, co we a young man. She 
was 80 iously a flapper that one 
did not. need to hear her speak to 


know that wisdom had not yet brought . 


solemnity into her life. Sbe was the 
pitch in the jazz music of the moment 
to which the boy: was trying to tune 
himself. 

Her name was Irene Shepherd; his 
Charles Byers—and such was Char- 
ley’s degree of gone-ness that if Irene 
had chewed a sausage in the office 
during the day, instead of her perpet- 
ual gum, why Charley would have ru- 
minated upon sausages, too, without a 
qualm of doubt as to the sanity of the 
habit or the positiveness of its pleas- 
ures, and he would have kept his pock- 
ets stocked with sausages, as he did 
with gum, for Irene’s convenience. 

But a great lawyer with his mind 
full of weighty problems, is not ex- 
pected to assay these romantic details 
in a glance, and to Mr. Howell as 
he pushed his message across the 
counter, the two clerks were sexless, 
ageless, featureless automatons. The 
message was to be sent collect“ and 
without a word Mr. Howell turned to 
leave. 

“I win, I win,” cried Irene in a 
voice of blissful triumph. 

The famous lawyer turned about in 
wonderment. He saw the girl glee- 
fully tapping the boy’s nose with a 
pencil, to which Charley submitted 
with an unqualified expression that 
meant he was filled with pride that 
he had a nose for Irene to tap. 

Mr. Howell frowned. He called 
sharply: Will you send that right 
out?“ 

To his annoyance and surprise the 
only result of his request was that the 
girl’s face became long and sad in an 
instant, and the boy, in deepest sym- 
pathy, said: “What a shame!” 

Mr. Howell was bristling now. “If 
this is a Punch and Judy show, I’ve 
made a mistake,” he said. “I thought 
this was a telegraph office. Does 
that wire go right out or not?” 

Charley and Irene faced front with 
a jerk. “Yes, sir; your message will 
go right out,” Charley . stammered. 
Still neither he nor Irene made an 
attempt to take the message. 

“Well, pick it up, pick it up.” the 
lawyer demanded irritably. 

Charley thought it best to explain.

Next Week, Trailin',“ by Max Brand. 


(Continued From Yesterday.) 

Her eyes full of longing, scorn and 

4 unhappiness, devoured Billie's face. 

Her bitter mouth curled open mirth- 

15 She threw herself forward un- 
tl her face was close to his. 

= “T rode in to tell you I saw a bunch 

ok your dogies over at Twin Rocks,” 

“I reckon it might make a 

nlee ride for your lady friend over 

there an’ back. I laid off to tell you 

today when I saw you at the willows, 

but I hated to interrupt. I wouldn't 


— “Much obliged.” Billie's eyes were 
as stern as hers were bitter. “I reckon 
it was me that did th’ interruptin’ 
3 when you was“cuttin’ th’ wire, 
5 HBritches. You might as well ride 
ey back with us an’ tell us all about it, 
a ’ 3 and where-all you’ve been stayin’.” 
He pulled his horse aside so that 
dhe might fall in between himself and 
Jack, but she flung herself back into 
15 Bo ' the saddle with a quick oath, and she 
x must have buried a cruel spur in the 
| roan’s flank, for he leaped forward 
/ with a squeal of pain and an instant 
afterward horse and rider flashed past 
ay as suddenly as they had appeared. In 
aui a moment the rush of hoofs through 
Pee ca the swishing grass came to them, grow- 
op ing less and less distinct; the vague 
ay Shape of the galloping horse, with her 
' ~~ figure an indistinct, blur against his 
| neck, passed into the shadows and she 
was gone. 
* By Heck!“ Jack swore softly under 
his breath. “What did you let her go 


kor?!“ ae 
„don't fight women,” Billie an- 


. ‘swered. “It’s the man who's behind 
her that I'm after.“ 
CHAPTER VII. 
Word passed through the valley 
that the Desmonds had disappeared. 
One of the Circle O men, returning 
from town with a mail sack, stopped 
1 at the Three Nines and told of the 
Hlitting of the nesters. 
“First, Little Britches, she lit out, 
an' now the old man he’s vamoosed,” 
Nhe told Billie, who came out to get 
the mail. “I reckon if them folks 
; ‘told all they know the old man 
* wouldn't be wanderin’ around looking 
if fror his two-year-olds. He'd know 
on ere tuh put his finger on em.“ 
= 


illie could not refute the insinua- 
Aion. In his heart he was sure Lit- 
tle Britches had not played a square 


game with the ranchers who had been 
her friends. He answered with a 
“-eurt word of thanks for the package 
ok mail, nearly all of which belonged 
to Geraldine. As he turned away, 
975 he saw ber waiting in the door. She 
took the letters and glanced over 
them eagerly. At sight of one en- 
wvelope her expression changed. It was 
a yellow envelope with black letter- 
ing, Cablegram,“ across its face, 


and she tore it open hastily. When | 


„che had read it she looked up at Bil- 
“lie; pale and trembling. 
“He is coming,” she said in a low 
voice. “He is sailing in a boat that 
„left England yesterday.” 
Their eyes turned to meet each 
 other’s, and for a moment the veil be- 
tween them dropped and they read 
each other’s thoughts. 

“Are you going to marry him?“

Billie asked, “Is that what he is com- 
ing for?“ 

She returned his look, and her 
face quivered slightly. 

“I—I—don’t know. I have prom- 
ised.” 

Jou love him—you love him now?” 

“I did—yes—when I left England.” 

“You've changed—you don’t see

mustn’t ever find out.“ 

Mrs. Moffatt came to the door and 
called out to Billie. 

Mr. Jack asked me to tell you to 
follow him,” she said. He went away 
an hour ago and he predicted it would 
be snowing before night.” 

The revealing moment was gone. 
Life dropped back into its old grooves, 
and what might have been said was 
left unspoken. ; 

“Shouldn’t wonder if he was right,” 
Billie acknowledged dully. “Well, I'll 
be ridin’ after him, I guess.“ 

He went off to the corral where 

idow Green, already saddled, was 
tied to a post. From the doorway 
Geraldiné watched him, forgetting the 
cablegram in her hand. She id often 
watched him ride away, but today 
there was something in the droop of 
his shoulders and the square set of 
his jaw that was different. He was 
nearer to her because of that second 
when they had looked into each oth- 
er's eyes; but she too realized the 
moment was over, and life was draw- 
ing them apart for all time. 

Geraldine roused herself from her 
abstraction and glanced from the win- 
dow at the darkening sky. The three 
at the ranch knew nothing about bliz- 
zards. The word was merely a hame 
to them, but if they knew little of 
the suffering and danger that lay in 
the wake of this dread scourage of 
the north, they soon enough felt the 
bite of its teeth. With every hour 
the world outside changed until it be- 
came a place of white mystery. 

In spite of the cold Geraldine spent 
most of the time near the window. It 
was early in the afternoon when she 


saw the vague outlines of two mount- 
ed figures approaching the house, trav- 
eling single file with the wind at 
their backs. As they came nearer she 
saw that they were strange. 

When they were in speaking dis- 
tance Jarrow went out to meet them. 
Re-entering, he was followed by Lit- 
the’ Britches and a heavy-featured 
m2n, at sight of whom Geraldine gave 


other from Mrs. Moffatt. 

“Uncle Norman !” 

The girl ran to him, instinctively 
putting out her arms, but they were 
never clasped around his neck. The

eall of kinship, born suddenly, died as 
she came close to him, for there was 
something in’ his face, well remem- 
bered as it was, that brought a barrier 
between them. He was her father’s 
brother and of her own blood, but 
she shrank from him; the years that 
lay between held phases that sepa- 
rated them eternally. Her arms fell 
to her sides. : 

Norman Hoyt did not notice the re- 
pulsion of her attitude. He asumed 
a hearty air, which was denied by 
his shifting eyes, and attempted to 
take her hand, which she refused him. 

“What!” He pretended surprise, 
and finally she gave him her hand, 
but it was cold and limp, without 
response. He had removed the glove 
from his left hand, and they exchanged 
an awkward greeting. “What! You 
don’t seem overjoyed to see me, my 
dear! It is only by a lucky chance 
that I learned of your being here. 
What possessed you to do such a 
thing? When I was told that you 
were here, living within a few miles 
of where I am staying, I was amazed. 
The word is hardly strong enough. 1 
was shocked. I could not wait for 
the storm to pass, but came to you 
at once. Well, what have you to 
say to me” 

“Why shouldn’t I be here” she re- 
turned. It is your house, and to 
whom should I come if not to you?” 


scowl; he hesitated as though the ad- 
mission was a bitter one to make, 
but when it came it was sweeping in 
its humiliation for the girl. 

“Because this is not my house,” he 
said harshly. “You are living in the 
home of a stranger—you yourself are 
a stranger on his bounty. The story 
is all over the county. You have 
given people the right to say what 
they please of you.” 

Geraldine was as white as death. 

“Not your house,” she repeated in 
a whisper. But he said—he said—” 

“I suppose he lied to you,” Hoyt 
admitted grudgingly. The question 
is what's to be done with you?” 

“What is to be done with me?’ 
Geraldine repeated faintly. “Il—I— 
am very stupid. I don’t understand.” 

Hoyt frowned . His choleric face 
turned a deeper purple. He was 
standing near the stove, and the heat 
seemed to strike in and smother him. 
With an impatient movement he 
ripped open his heavy coat. and slip- 
ped his big shoulders half out of it. 
The action revealed a certain awk- 
wardness, for it was accomplished 
with his left hand. The right one 
hung heavy and limp; it was swathed 
in bandages that showed white 
through his woolen glove. 

Her manner infuriated him. 

“IT refuse to allow you to remain 
under the roof of this gambler—this 


Hoyt’s dark face, heavy with lines 
of dissipation, deepened into an angry 


renegade—another hour. Get into 


a horse for you. These two old idiots 
may stay until I send for them.” 

“Very well, I will go with you, if 
you will leave the price of the horse 
I ride,” she said, and turned away to 
her own room, 

When she reappared, Jarrow and 
Mrs. Moffatt were alone. Through 
the window she saw Hoyt leading her 
saddled horse from the barn. 

Tell him—tell him, some day we 
will pay him back,“ she said and went 
out of the door into the storm. 


- CHAPTER VIII. 
Revelations. 4 

The beginning of the storm found 
Billie Stranger a long way from home 
with the wind at his back. He had 
not followed dack, after all, for, when 
he saw the change coming, he thought 
it best to go after a bunch of his two- 
year-olds which pastured in another 
part of the range. But when he 
reached the range there was no sign 
of them. He knew they had sensed 
the storm and moved before it, so he 
followed. ‘Then he came to a gap 
where his fence had been cut, and 
he could not help thinking of Little 
Britches. 

It was midday before he found the 
cattle. Ale was a long way from 
home, and the storm was swiftly de- 
veloping into what seemed an impas- 
sable white.wall that pierced through 


your heavy clothes while I saddle flesh and blood and blinded eyes and

stopped breath. They could not go 
on much longer, and he began to 
think of a place where he might 
bunch them in safety until the wind 
dropped. 
He knew whe erhe was when Wid- 
ow Green told him by the tensing 
spring of her body that she was on 
level ground footing. There was lit- 
tle plowed ground in that section, 
and all of it was under fence except 
the Weed Patch. As soon as this 
came to him he knew where ha was. 
One winter long past, the nester, 
inspired by a passing ambition, had 
‘contracted to feed a bunch of cows 
for an overstocked rancher. He had 
built a hollow square of hay racks, 
and their remnants, which still con- 
tained some rotting straw, remained 
in the deserted pasture. The bunch 
would be safe there until morning. 
Presently the dim, stark shape of the 
feed racks appeared through the 


chaos of whirling whiteness, ' 
With the cattle disposed of he had 
time to think of himself and his horse. 


He could have found his way home 
easily enough from this point, but 
he did not wish to leave the bunch 
in the open land with only the dis- 
mantled racks to hold them. He 
knew that the nester’s shack was 
empty and it stood suddenly in his 
path. The door v. s ajar, and he en- 
tered, leading the horse. In their 
flitting the Desmonds had left their 
household goods, such as they were, 
and it was possible to pass the night 
with some degree of comfort. There 
was a rusty stove, and the coffee pot 
left where it had last been used, and 
there were some blankets on the 
bunk that had belonged to Desmond, 
and some half-filled paper bags that 
might contain food on a shelf. There 
was room in a corner for the horse. 
In spite of its ramshackle appearance 


the place was fairly tight and warm, 
and in a short time the coffee 

was beginning to steam over the 

that roared in the little stove. Out- 
side the storm lashed the shack and 
beat upon the tin roof. It lulled him 
to the borderland of sleep—so that 


when the horse iifted her head and 


gave a sharp neigh he was brought 
rudely back to consciousness. 


In a second he was alert and on 
his feet. He had barred the door 
against the onslaugut of the wind, 
and as he took down the barrier a 
muffled rap came. He expected to 
discover some lost, belated rider like 
himself, asking for shelter, but when 
the door swung .back he saw Little 
Britches standing there. She had dis- 
mounted and was standing close be- 
side her horse, but she made no move 
to enter. He seized her arm and 
drew her inside. ;

cussed at the luncheon of «he Atlanta

look for steady improvement througk 
the year 1922.

The interruption, brief as it was, 
was sufficient to give the fugitive a 
substantial gain and when pursuit 
again started down Pryor street, the 
inan gradually outdistanced all pur- 
suers and disappeared in an alley back 
ef the J. M. High company building 
on Whitehall street. a 
That man's some sprinter.“ said 
Bishop. But I'd have caught him if 
tLat automobile hadn’t butted in.“ 


Teller Becomes Suspicious. 


One of the tellers of the banking 
zustitution became suspicious when 
the man presented a check, and after 
careful examination became vonvinced 
that it war a forgery. 

Calling Officer Bishop, he oi dered 
the man arrested. When the cfficer 
grabbed him, the forger gave a violent 
jerk. broke the officer’s grip and made 
a dash to the Whitehall street en- 
trance, 

Officer Bishop described the man as 
follows: About 24 or 25 yeers of 
age; extremely weil dressed, wearing 
a light overcoat and light soft felt 
hat; smroth shaven and unusually 
good-looking. There was a slight scar 
on his right cheek, which was distinct- 
y noticeale. 

Policemen and detectives were noti- 
fied and began a search for th. fugi- 
tive. No arrests had been effected 
Monday night. Detectives staten they 
believed the man to be a stranger in 
the city. 


MOTORMAN 
HELD UP. 
With a bandit’s revolver pressing 


against his forehead, Motorman 8. 
Bryan, of the Lakewood line, was rob- 
bed of a valuable watch and $6 in 
cash, when two unidentified young 
white men boarded his car as it rounes 
the Lakewood loop early Monday 
night. The holdup occurred just after 
conductor R. L. MePharland had 
alighted from the car with the day’s 
receipts. The robbers got away. 
Just as the Lakewood car in charge 
f Conductor McPharland and Motor- 
man Bryan reached the beginning of 
the loop at the end of the line, abour 
7:30 o’clock Monday night, the con- 
ductor alighted to wait until the mo- 
torman made the turn. He had a large 
sum in cash on his person. 

The matorman was the only person 
on the car when it was boarded by two 
young strangers. “Where's the conduc- 
tor?” one of them inquired. “none of 
your business,” he was informed. The 
moterman was then forced to put up 
his hands. His pockets were searched 
and the valuables were taken. The 
gunmen then disappeared in the dark- 
ness. 

After joining his conductor, Motor- 
man Bryan went to the nearest tele- 
phone and gave his story to the county 
police. Lieutenant Oliver and officers 
Jackson and Lyle, mounted on motor- 
cycles, were rent to make an investi- 
gation. but after patrolling the roads 
for miles around and searching the 
woods in the vicinity for hours no 
trace of the strangers was found. 

No detailed description of the men 
could be furnished by the motorman. 
One man was tall and the other com- 
paratively short. he said. The short 
one wore an overall jumper. 


HETIRLOOMS 
STOLEN. 
Returning home after an absence of 


21 East Third street, surprised a ne- 
gro burglar in the act of looting her 
residence. He escaped with jewelry 
and silverware of an estimated value 
of $1,250. | 

Just after she entered the house 
the negro dashed from a back room 
through a large reception hall, jumped 
through a window, leaped over a ban- 
ister and fled. 

Among the missing articles are two 
antique watches, a number of jewels 
precious to the family for years as 
heirlooms, and other small articles of 
value. City detectives secured a de- 
seription of the. negro. 


KERFEY HOME 
IS LOOTED. 


Entering through a rear door, bur- 
glars rifled the home of C. H. Kerfey, 
of 560 Ponce de Leon avenue, tak- 
ing away clothing and jewelry esti- 
mated at between $4,000 and $5,000 
in value, the robbery, it is thought, 
having taken place some time between 
4 and 5 o’clock Monday afternoon. 

Among the articles of clothing stolen 
was a sealskin coat worth $450, as 
well as many of the effects of Mrs. 
Kerfey, Mrs. M. E. Gilfillan and Miss 
Dollie Evins. 

Although no arrests have been made 
as yet, suspicion is directed to a for- 
mer cook, who, it is thought, entered 
the dwelling late Monday afternoon. 

RESS

While detectives were seeking a 
negro woman Monday in connection 
with the murder of Lum On, a Chi-

Ent: angible Assets 


Business men often do not consider seriously what may be 
called intangible assets and yet such assets form just as much 
a part of business success as those things that are more prom- 
inently in evidence. Take for instance, the quality and style 
of the paper and envelopes used in a business man’s corre- 
spondence, which either repels or attracts prospective cus- 
tomers in accordance with the taste exercised in its get up.”

CONSIDERS ‘ROME. 
GAS RATE TODAY 


day will hear a petition filed by the 
Rome Municipal Gas company request- 
ing an increase in gas rates from $1.50 
to $2 a thousand cubic feet. 

Several months ago the commission 


to increase its rates to $2 a thousand 
provided certain prescribed improve- |: 
ments were made. After severa: 
weeks representatives of the city of 
Rome appeared before the commission 
and contended that the improvements 
stipulated had not been made by the 
company. The commission then re- 
stored the old rate of $1.50 a thousand. 
It is now contended by the gas 
company officials that the improve- 
ments stipulated by the commission 
have been made and that the company 
should be permitted to charge a higher : 
rate. 

The Rome Municipal Gas company 
is not owned by the city of Rome but 
is the property of private citizens. 
Judge Max Meyerhardt will represent 
the city of Rome at the hearing 
Tuesday. 

The petition of the Bulloch Tele- 


phone Co., of Statesboro, asking per- 
mission. to increase rates <a its rural 
telephone lines also will be heard by 
the commission Tuesday.
