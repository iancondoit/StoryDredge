Mrs. Estelle Williams, charged with 
.*- ~arder of N. L. Post, was found 
guilty of voluntary manslaughter by 
a jury in the criminal division of 
Fulton superior court Friday night, 
and was sentenced to serve from one 
to five years by Judge John D. Hum- 
phries, who returned from his home 
in Hapeville to receive the verdict. 

The case, which was begun Wed- 
nesday, was one of the most sensa- 
tional in the history of the criminal 
court. The shooting was the climax 
-of a Thanksgiving eve party, in which | 
Post, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Alma Har- 
vey and S. P. Curtis, participated, 
which ended at the home of Mrs. Wil- 
liams on Ormond street. Post was 

_a locomotive engineer for the Sea- 
board Air Line, while Mrs. Williams 

is the wife of N. E. Williams, a pri-{ 
vate detective.

concluded at 4:50 TitursdAy after-

Declaring that jealousy, which had 
dominated her thoughts and actions 
during the entire evening, was the 
motive for the slaying of Post by 
Mrs. Williams, Solicitor John A. Boy- 
kin begged the jury ta put aside all 
sentiment because the defendant was 
a woman and to apply the old law 
of “an eye for an eye.” 

Before a courtroom that was pack- 


ed and jammed to capacity, attor- 
neys for the state and the defendant 


waged a bitter battle before the jury. 
Solicitor Boykin, who had the clos- 
ing argument, urged the jury to con-

William Hohenzollern 
Sued for Maintenance 
By Widow of His Son 


Berlin, January 5.—(By the Asso- 
ciated Press.)\—Princess Joachim of 
Prussia, widow of the former Ger- 
man emperor's youngest son, who 
committed suicide in 1920, is bringing 
action agairfst William Hohbenzollern 
for a maintenance allowance, on the 
ground that her marriage contract, 
concluded in accordance with the laws 
of the Hohenzollerns, entitles her to 
the means of subsistence. 

The case was begun before a Berlin 
court today. Counsel for the defense 
argued that these laws were no longer 
valid. The hearing was adjourned aft-

New York, January 5.—Early sum- 
moning of an international agreement 
conference to iron out commercial dif- 
ferences which he declared were the 
root of most modern warfare, was 
urged by Cordell. Hull, chairman of 
the democratic national committee, in 
an address tonight at the Jackson 
Day dinner of the ‘sennessee society, 
of New York. 

“During past years,” he said, “we 
have seen practiced with impunity all 
forms of tariff discrimination and re- 
taliation, preferential right of entry of 
ports, violations of the “open door” 
of copyrights, trade marks, 
brands, wrongful interference 
trade routes, unfair utilization of 
bounties, bonuses, subsidies, draw- 
backs and rebates, the economic and 
financial violation of small, unciviliz- 
ed, or backward nations, tonnage and 
shipping discriminations, economic 
alliances, trade concessions and other 
preferences by special agreement. 
Many of these are trouble-making, 
war-breeding practices. 

“International steps have already 
been taken in a-tmheasure to deal with 
certain phases of these dangerous 
practices and policies. It is certain 


they can only be dealt with and abol- 
ished by international agreement.”

The most feasible plan, hé. su

of the “most favorable nation doctrine

Washington, January 5.—Major 
Hierome L. Opie, of Staunton, Va. 


commander of the third Matislion. 


116th infantry, overseas, declared to- 
day before a senate investigating com- 
mittee there was not a word of truth 
in charges by former service men that 
he had shot his own soldiers. 

“I never shot a man in my life,” 
he asserted, “unless perhaps an en- 
emy in battle.’ 

Alfred D. Barksdale, of Lynchburg, 
Va., a captain, who succeeded Opie 
to command of the battalion when the 
latter was injured, declared he first 
heard of the shooting charges two 
weeks ago. 

No Such Man. 

Barksdale explained that there 
were two Woolwines in the battal- 

f that. Ernest” Woolwiie; stot Th 
action, died in his arms, and that 
Walker was killed a week later. He 
declared there was no William Wool- 
wine—the man Opie is alleged to have 
shot—in the command. 

. “Did you hear of any illegal hang- 
ings?” Chairman Brandegee asked. 

“No, sir.” 

“Do you think it probable that of- 
ficers could hang men, escape court- 
martial and keep it quiet?” 

“I don’t see how it could happen.”

Following the amputation of one 
of his legs following an accident at 
Emory university about 8 o'clock 
Wednesday night, when he was caught 
between two street cars, B. F. Simms, 
of Roanoke, Ala., received transfu- 
sions of blood from five of his fellow 
students at the Davis-Fischer sanita- 
rium Thursday afternoon. 

At 4 o'clock after hope of saving 
the limb had been given up, it was 
decided to amputate, the leg being 
severed above the knee. ‘The eall for 
volunteers to give their blood in a 
transfusion met with a ready response 
from the Emory students, those sub- 
mitting to the operation being J. BS. 
Hartsfield, of West Palm Beach, Fla. ; 
H. H. Allen, of Columbus, Ga.; Wil- 
liam Hughes, of Cordele, Ga.; ‘TI. C. 
Partridge, of Atlanta, and Joe Gra- 
ham, of Fort Valley, Ga. ‘Three oth- 
ers are held in readiness if further 
transfusions of blood are necessary. 
Volunteers from the Tech student 
body offered to submit te an opera- 


enough Emory men have given in 
their names to the superintendent. 

The parents of the injured student, 
Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Simms, and his 
sister, Miss Jennie Dell Simms, arrived 
from Roanoke, Ala., Thursday morn- 
ing. A brother, who was also a stu- 
dent at Emory, J. K. Simms, Jr., is 
at the bedside of the patient. 

Dr. W. W. Stevenson, the Simms’ 
family physician, stated ‘Thursday 
night that although the injured boy's 


‘condition is serious, he has a fighting 


chance, and that he is much better 
than he was earlier in the day. 
The accident occurred when Simms 


laccommodated a motorman. at the end 


of the Emory car line, it is said, by 
changing his trolley, while at the same 
time another car approached and ran 
into the first cdr, crushing his leg

Dublin, January 5.—Disruption of 
the dail eireann and a deadlock which 
undoubtedly would have wrecked not 
only the Irish peace treaty but all 
chances for a future solution of Ire- 
land’s relations with Great Britain, 
is believed to have been averted by a 
meeting of eight members of the Irish 
parliament, fogr supporters of the 
Collins-Ggiffith faction, amt four ex- 
treme republicans. ti 

A partial agreement, it is kde 
| stood, has been reached,’¢nder which 
passage of the treaty will be permit- 
ted. The out-and-out republicans 
take the stand that they @an no more 
accept De Valera’s al‘ernate proposals 
than they can vote for the Griffith 
agreement, since the Irish:president’s 
document differs only slightly from 
that negotiated in London. It is ex- 
pected that the republicans will with- 
draw, in hope that De Valera and the 
immediate coterie of his personal fol- 
lowers will remain in the dail to con- 
stitute a working opposition. 

Meet Again Friday. 

The dail eireann adjourned at 4 
o'clock to let the special committee 
fight out this phase of the situation 
in the evening, and will’ meet again 
in secret Friday thorning. 

The seriousness of the situation.is 
illustrated by the declaration of J. J. 
Walsh, one of the treaty adherents, 
that as the situation stands today, the 
treaty would be defeated by two votes. 
Other delegates - agree with Walsh, 
and it is gloomily admitted in most 
quarters that the peace pact is in ex- 
treme jeopardy. 

The “freedom of the press” is be- 
ginning to play another important 
part in the debate. In addition to 
the general excitement caused by the 
kidnaping of A. B. Kay, correspondent 
of The London Times, Dublin is 
ablaze with comment over the Dublin 
Freeman’s Journal, which has launch- 
ed a vitriolic attack at .the dail 
eireann die-hards. 

The foreign correspondents in Dub- 
lin will renew their protest aaainst 
Kay’s kidnaping on Friday, having 
held it up upon the receipt of a tele 
gram from Cork stating that Kay 
would be handed over to the Irish re- 
publican army at 

Attacks Valera. 

Bitter criticism was levelled through- 
outtheday at The Freeman’s Jour- 
gal, which has hitherto been one of 
Sinn Fein’s staunchest supporters. The 
Journal attacked both De Valera and 
Erskine Childers, charging the Irish 


president with “jealous vanity, with- 
out the instinct of an Irishman,” add- 
ing that “it is a curse to Ireland that 
its unity should be broken by such a

Letter Reported Here; 
and Berrien 


Alleged Copy of Extracts 

From Document’ Given 
Out for Publication by 
Postoffice Inspector. 


LAMAR POOLE DENIES 
RECEIVING THE LETTER 


Inspector N. H. Graham 
Declares It Came to His 
Office From Chief of De- 


tectives in June. 


Following the indictment of KR. N. 
}Berrien, Jr., Floyd Woodward and 
twenty-four others for alleged mis- 
use of the mails in connection with 
the bunco syndicate, the existence of 
a document purporting to be portions 
of a second letter received by some- 
one in Atlanta from Floyd Woodward 
last spring became known Thursday 
afternoon. The part of the letter 
given out is largely devoted to an 
attack on Berrien and Joseph Ew- 
ing, and a description of the alleged 
connection of the broker with the 
bunco gang. 

The alleged copy of extracts from 
the Woodward letter, purporting to 
conneet Berrien, the broker now 
sought by the state for embezzling 
state school warrant funds, with the 
bunco operations in Atlanta, was 
shown to a reporter by Postoffice 
Inspector H. N. Graham... The inspec- 
ter stated that it had been furnished 
to his office in June by Cifief of De- 
| tectives A. I. Poole. 

Chief Poole, when shown the doc- 
ument Thursday night, immediately 
denied any knowledge of it. 

“Never Saw It’’—Poole. 

“If I ever gave the postoffice in- 
spector any extracts of a letter from 
Woodward, they were from the letter 
which was widely published at thé 
time. I have never heard of any sec- 
ond letter.” The chief took the copy, 
typewritten on two sheets of white 
bond paper, scrutinized it and said: 
“I never saw that in all my life.” 
He then added that he was too busy 
to discuss it, anyway. 

Inspector Graham could not be 
reached after the detective head de- 
nied having any knowledge of the al- 
leged letter. It was stated at the 
federal building that the chief was 
supposed to know the name of the 
party who actually possessed the en- 
tire letter. 

Shortly after the lengthy document 
alleged to have been a letter from 
Floyd Woodward was received in At- 
lanta by Rev. C. B. Wilmer, and 
published, it became rumored about 


that the fugitive bunco leader had 
directed a second communication to 
some one in Atlanta. ‘The police de 
partment denied that the letter ex- 
isted.

on Economic Rebuilding: 


Cannes, January 5.—(By the As-

the forthcoming international eco- 
nomic conference was uppermost in 
today’s conversations between the pre- 
miers and the chief delegates to the 
supreme council which meets in ses-

The French view has been that the

mier, agreed to this, and that the 
question will be the first discussed 
. when the council goes into session at 
11 o’elock tomorrow morning, 

_In addition to a continuation of the 
private talks between  Aristride

Washington, January 5.—The great- 
est step ever taken toward the ulti- 
mate abolition of the submarine has 
been taken by the arms conference. 

Unanimous agreement was register- 
ed by the five powers late Thursday 
upon articles one and two of the origi- 
nal Root resolutions, (now arranged 
in three articles), regarding subma- 
rine warfare, with but minor altera- 
tions in language. 

These resolutions, providing for an 
invitation to the rest of the world 
to follow the “big five,” first em- 
brace subscription to a restatement of 
international law governing rules of 
submarine operation against merchant 
vessel.

Upon Learning Victim 
Had Not Been Robbed. 


REVOLVER IS FOUND 
IN REAR SEAT OF CAR 


Bullet Penetrated Brain, 

“Entering. in the Very 
Center of the Back of 
His Head. 


J. Russell Compton, prominent At- 
lanta business man and secretary and 
treasurer of the Nunnally-McRea com- 
pany, overall manufacturers, was 
shot and instantly“Rilled shortly after 
6 o'clock Thursday night in his au- 
tomobile, which he had just removed 
from the garage in the rear of the 
overall factory at 41 East Mitchell 
street, in an, alley running ino Mitch- 
ell street. 

After working on the case for siz 
hours,.the police were without a elew 
as to the identity of the assassin at 
midnight Thursday night. They ad- 
vanced the theory that the person whe 
slew Mr. Compton did not do so with 
robbery of personal valuables or his 
automobile as the motive, but instead 
knew Mr. Compton well and killed 
him as the result of jealousy of some 
ned. . 

The pistol with which Mr. Compton 
was slain was found in the rear seat 
of the automobile, where police assert 
sat the person who fired the fatal 
bullet. "he shell which lad been ex- 
pleded’and which -sped= a bullet 
through the base of Mr. Compton's

‘front seat of the car, and detectives 


“That the five signatory powers ac- 
cept the prohibition of the use of sub- 

marines as commerce destroyers as 
binding between themselves, and in- 
vite all other nations to follow suit, 
that such prohibition ma¥ bce made 
part of the law of nations.” 

There is yet one more. of the Root 
resolutions on submarines to be 
adopted—that providing that any sub- 
marine commander who violates the 
‘ules laid down as governing subma- 
rine operation in commerce destruc- 
tion, shall be regarded as a pirate, 
and, if captured, tried for piracy. 

Experts Differ. 

While experts differ as to the po- 
tentiality of submarines against fight- 
ing craft—the British claiming that 
their war experience proved they were 
virtually useless against such vessels 
—there is agreement that the great- 
est power of fhe submarine is against 
merchant vessels. 

For that reason, the agreement 
reached among the powers to bond 
themselves against its use for destruc- 
tion of commerce in event of hostili- 
ties among themselves is held to be a 
stride toward the ultimate abolition 
of the weapon entirely. 

French Meet “Test.” 4 - 

It was held to be significant in 
this connection, that when the article 
was adopted, France voting with the 
rest in the affirmative, the British 
delegation regarded its “test” of 
French sincerity completely met by 
the French.‘ It was generally ac- 
knowledged that the Balfour amend- 
ment to the original Root proposal 
on prohibiting use of the submarine 
as @ commerce destroyer—the amend- 
ament stipulating that the five pow- 
ers immediately subscribe to such 
prohibition—was a test of the French 
claim that their submarine expansion 
did not mean intention to strike at 
British commerce. Balfour previous- 


ly had declared that the French pro- 
|} gram could mean nothing else. 

As a result of the gay’s develop- 
ments, Lord Lee, representing the Brit- 
ish delegation, made a speech declar- 
ing his complete satisfaction with M. 
Sarraut’s attitude against the subma- 
rine as a commerce destroyer. Sar- 
raut responded in kind and that re 
cent flare-up apparently has now 
passed into history.

Mystery Shrouds Crime. 

When they had Qnearthed these 
meager details of the sensational kill- 
ing, the sleuths apparently ran against 
a blank wall, and the reason for the 
slaying and the identity of the per- 
son who ct ~mitted the deed ar@ 
shrouded in't “epest of mystery. 

The bullet pena ‘ted the brain, 
striking in the very center of the back 
of the head. Mr. Compton’s home 
was at 103 Ponce de Leon avenue, 
where he lived with his mother. 

The dead bodyewas found in the 
rear of 41 East Mitchell street at 
6:17 o'clock by J. A. Dillon, an em- 
ployee of Harry G. Poole’s undertak- 
ing establishment. When found, the 
dead man was sitting behind the 
steering wheel, with one hand out- 
stretched as if he had been attempt- 
ing to shift the gear when death voc» 
curred. , 

The person who fired the fatal bul- 
let must have been in the rear sea 
of the automobile, detectives assign 
to the case assert, as indicated by 
traces of powder burns on the back of

Mr. Dillon, after discovering the 
body, quickly notified police headquar-

the scene, but at latest ceports no 
trace of the slayer has been reported. 

Flashlights were used to find foot- 
steps, all efforts to trace along this 
line were futile. 

Mr. Dillon immediately placed the 
body in an ambulance anda rushed to

stated that death had occurred _

Leader in Business. 

Mr. Compton was 39 years old, and 
one of Atlanta’s leading business men. 
He had been connected with the Nun-

of twenty years. 

A graduate of Boys’ High school, 
Mr. Compton entered the business 
world at an early age, and at the time 
of his death had accumulated a sub- 
stantial fortune. He was a member 
of the leading clubs of the city and 
several secret organizations. He was 
a member of All Saints’ church.

victims might draw on their accounts 
without exciting suspicion. The al- 
leged second letter refers to the same 
transactions, and charges that Berrien 
and Attorney Joe Ewing received a 
commission of 2 1-2 per cent each for 
negotiating the transactions. 

Those indicted Thursday by the fed- 
eral grand jury were: A. ’B. Moore, 
\Kloyd .Woodward, W. Clyte Smith, 
“Swifty’ Klein, J. W. Walker, N. O. 
Ellis, George Irwin, J. P. MoCas-

Jack E. Adams, Frank Lawrence, 
George Kennedy, Charles McCard, 
George Lleyd, Americus Lee,. colored; 
Brint Mooney, H. B. Lewis and J. 
W. Fitzmaurice. : 

Although only nine indictments 
were returned, the 26 men were list- 
ed in the nine. 

Copy of Letter. 
The complete text of the two pages 
of the reported second letter from 
Woodward reads as follows: — 
“Before Rehard tried to buy $25,000 
worth of liberty bonds from R. Noble 
Berrien there were.twoa other victims 
One was 
from Texas, and [ think his name was 
McDowell. He put $20,000 ‘worth of 
drafts through Berrien’s office and 
bought liberty bonds with the money. 
Which, of course, he was swindled out 
of. The other man was from near 
Dothan, Ala. The amount was be- 
tween $8.000 and $15,000—I think it 
was $12,000.. If you can’t dig this 


-|up through Berrien’s office or through 


the bank a certain party can get in 
touch with someone who in turn can 
furnish you with the victims’ names 
and addresses, 
“Now this victim from Alabama 
and Rehard were taken to Berrien’s 
office at difference times. Each was 
taken to Berrien’s office by the same 
man. I don’t mean that they were 
steered by the same man. But they 
were taken there by the man that 
played the inside. The same part that 
Powers took. On each occasion the 
man who brought the victim to Ber- 
rien's Office. introduced bimself to 
Berrien as a perfect stranger. Of 
course, Berrien knew he was to do 
this. This man’s picture is there in 
Atlanta now. So if it will do any 
g00d I will send you his name. His 
picture could be identified by each 
vietim. And each victim would tell 
that the same man introduced him- 
self to Berrien as if he were a 
stranger. Now if Berrien was not in 
on the deal how could he allow a 
— that he geod i se met a few 
eekS previous, and done $10,000 or 
$15,000 worth of business rg and 
talked to on several*occasions, to in- 
troduce —— as a perefct stranger? 

PHY t Five Per Cent.--. -: 

Ewing and Berrien got 5. per cent 
of the gross for each one of these 
pieces of business. Ewing paid Ber- 
rien his 2% per cent. On one oc- 
casion it was paid by Ewing to Ber- 
rien with a check, and I think it was 
80 paid each time. As he, Ewing. 
was instructed to do so, and said 
that he did.. Now if all this is dug 
up you can’t fail to get Berrien. And 
when you get Berrien you get Ewing. 
And when you get Ewing you are 
pretty apt to get Boykin. For I have 
never seen a man like Joe Ewing 
yet that would stand the gaff—and 
he has got it on Boykin if he ever 
begins to spill what he knows about 
the Hon. J. A. B., the people will just 
have to open their eyes. 

_ “Ewing States that while he was 
in the hospital I took his office fur- 
niture to my place. To start with he 
had no office furniture at this time 
Neither did I have any place. I was 
not in town. Ed Mills had beat a 
fellow up while I was along and the 
law wanted both of us. We stayed 
out of town for two or three months. 
Later on we came back and surren- 
deréd, and were acquitted of every- 
thing except gambling. For which

- Says Ewing Got Furniture. 

Either shortly before or shortly 
after Mill’s death Joe Ewing went to 
the Healey building, paid some back 
rent on an old store that had belong- 
ed to and got the furni- 
ture and sent it out to his house. It 
stayed there for a few weeks and then 
was set up in offices in the Central 
building, where some business was 
done. It stayed there a few days, and 
after everybody had left town Joe 
had the furniture sent back to his 
house. Jt stayed there in his house 
until the next fall. Then it was moved 
into town for the winter. It was sent 
back to Joe Ewing's house in the 
spring of 1920. And it stayed there 
until it was moved into town again, 
which was about a month before Boy- 
kin took charge of it. 

“In the spring of 1920 a certain par- 
ty had heavy brass wire put around 
the desk to make it look like a cash- 
ier’s desk. It was the kind of wire 
they use in country banks. The dray- 
man who moved fhis furniture could 
be dug up. Lee could give you his 
name, Ajso there is a party in At- 
lanta now who could give you the 
number of the Healey building that 
his furniture was first moved frqm. 

can give you this party's name if 
necessary or wanted. And as Jve him- 
self went to the Healey building. and 
got it, certainly some official of the 
building could identify Joe Ewing as 
the man. Also it was Joe Ewing in 
person who attended to the moving 
of this furniture into and out of the 
Central building. The offices in the 
Central building were rented in the 
name of some advertising company. 
They faced Pryor street, and were 
about the middle of the building, the 
fourth floor, I think. These offices 
were rented in the Central building 
either in April or May. of 1919. 


Stealing Cars Charged. 

“The Paffoed. or Page, party was 
stealing cars with Ed Mills. Skinny 
Saunders was Pafford’s right, and he 
was a gunman from New York. Joe 
Ewing was around with them when 
Pafford got pinched. And it is my 
recollection that Joe had made Paf- 
ford some promise of getting him out 
‘in case he got in trouble. Well, after 
Pafford got pinched Joe was a little 
slow in getting him out. In fact. he 
tried to shake Pafford down, so Paf- 
ford one day called Joe Ewing over 
the telephone from the county jail. 
And when he got Joe on the line he 
called him every that he conld 
lay his tongue.to. The nature of this 
conversation could probably be veri- 
fied by some of the jailers. 

“About those whisky cases—I had 
to promise to give el 
up before. .

“Both Curtis and Alma Harvey 
have testified that they were in the

tis says that all four of them were 
there together when. Mrs. Williams 
shot. but the defense tries to make 
you believe that Post attempted to as-

these two witnesses. The thing is im- 
possible. It. is a plain case of jeal- 
ousy of a half-drunk woman.”

NO OLD WO°°EN NOWADAYS 

Modern dres#, hair dressers, facial 
experts and cosmetics all combine to 
keep women of all ages young and at- 
tractive in appearance. . Not until the 
‘telltale wrinkles become so deep, the 
figure stoops, or some ailment or 
weakness develops to drag a woman 
dewn does she realiy look her age. 

Every woman owes it to herself and 
her family to keep herself young in 
appearance, and happy. When head- 
aches, backache or “the blues” de- 
velop or when a woman reaches the 
trying age from forty-five to fifty, 
Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Com- 
pound may be depended upon to keep 
her in health as it has so many other 
women whose letters we are continual- 


ple as ten times as quick and effec- 
tive as whiskey, rock and rye, or any 
other cold -remedy they have ever 
tried. 

All drug stores are now supplied 
with the wonderful new elixir, so all 
you have to do to get rid of that cold 
is to step into the nearest drug store, 
hand the clerk half a dollar for a bot- 
tle of Aspironal and tell him to serve 
you two teaspoonfuls with four tea- 
spoonfuls of water in a glass. With 
your watch in your hand, take the 
drink at one swallow and call for 
your mwoney back in two minutes if 
vou cannot feek your cold fading 
away like a dream within the time 
limit. Don’t be bashful, for all drug- 
cists invite you and expect you to try 
it. Everybody’s doing it. 

When your cold or cough, due to a 
edid. is relieved, ‘take the remainder 
of the botlte home to your wife and 
babies, for Aspironal is by far the 
safest and most effective, the easiest 
to take and the most agreeable 


j cold remedy for children as well as 


adults.—(adv.)

There wasn't any stethoscope on 
the stage of the Atlanta theater yes- 


terday afternoon, but just the same 
any one who happened to drop back 
there could have heard hearts flut- 
tering with an intensity that was rem- 
iniscent of the roaring of a storm- 
ing sea or the applause that greets 
a victorious gladiator. 

And all this roaring came from the 
hearts of eight little girls of Atlan- 
ta, who.as they stood or sat and 
lounged about that stage, stripped of 
all its panoply and artificialty, could 
doubtless hear the plaudits of thou- 


nniston, Hattie 
gle, Jo Butler, Edith Bloom, Tess McMillan.

sands of audiences greeting each one 
individually as she sent her charms 
radiating over the footlights. 


For those eight little girls were 
on the threshold of a stage career. 


John Henry Mears, owner and man- 
ager of “The Broadway Whirl,” 
Thursday faced a coryphee shortage. 
One of his girls had been called back 
to New York and girls are a very im. 
portant component part of the Broad- 
way Whirl. 

Mr. Mears has been in Atlanta a 
number of times and he has marked 
the style and vivacity of Atlanta's 
girl supply. He has original ideas 
about obtaining talent for his chorus, 
too. “I don’t want the girls who 
have worn out all their charm and

youthfulness parading from agency to 
agency on Broadway,” he explains. 
“The real beauties know that they 
can get plenty of work in the big 
city. Those that would go en the 
road are not the type of girl 1 want. 


“Mine must be pretty and young and 
naturally graceful. That's all I re- 
quire. I'll teach them the rest.” 


And so he advertised for girls in 
Thursday’s Constitution and, at the 
appointed hour, enough had apeared to 
have formed the working basis for the 
chorus of some big spectacle—and they 
were pretty, uniformly pretty, too. and 
all excited and dressed up and blush- 
ing and enjoying the experience. 


Mr. Mears was passing on them with 


critical eve and aws reeeiving sugges- 


ly. Representative Fess, chairman of: 


the house committee on education, will 
very likely introduce the bill in the 
lower branch, and Senator Kenyon 


will probably father it in the senate. 
The bill will provide for a federal aid 


| of $30,000 a year to each state to begin 


with, graduating up each year until the 
federal aid reaches $50,000 annually 
for each state. 

It will be recalled that a bill similar 
to this: was introduced in the sixty: 
fifth congress by Mr. Howard. and a 
committee hearing was had, at whick 
Professor Stephens and other en 
gineering educators appeared. It was 
during the war, however, and it was 
impossible to get such legislation 
through when the nation’s treasury 
was being strained to meet the de- 
mands of the war andp avy depart: 
ments.

J. C. Teate, proprietor of a grocery 
store at 6 Llunnicutt street, when 
Teate made a quick move-to reacz 
the shotgun which he kej¢ behind 
the counter, made good their escape 
early Wednesday night. Both of the 
negroes fired at Teate, one of the 
bullets piercing his coat. 

The grocer was able to give the 
police a description of the negroes, 
whom he watched closely when they 
came in the store to make a purchase. 
On certain suspicious actions on tne 
part of the negroes, ‘Yeate made a 
dash for his shotgun which he key« 
for protection aguinst an emergency 
of’ this kind. 

When Teate reached his gun, both 
the negroes turned and run out of the 
door. One of the negroes, said Mr. 
Teate. was black, heavy set, and

LICENSE TAG LAW 
WILL BE TESTED; 
CHIEFS ARRESTED 


The question of whether or not au- 
tomobiles: operated by city and coun- 
ty police departments must be equip- 
ped with automobile license tags like 
all other automobiles will be tested 
in the courts following the arrest 
Thursday of Chief of Police James L. 
Beavers, of the Atlanta police depart- 
ment, and Chief George L. Mathieson, 
of the county police department, on 
warrants charging them with operat- 
ing automobiles without license. ‘The 


Beauchamp, license inspector, repre- 
senting the state motor vehicle de- 
partment. 


Both Chief Beavers and Chief 
Mathieson furnished! bonds of $100 
each when arrested by ceputies in 
the sheriff's office. Both vfficers ap- 
peared in the sheriff's office after 
they were notified of the existence 
of the warrants. 
the cases will be brought to trial 
at an early session of the city court 
of Atlanta. 

The city and county police depart- 
ments have a large number of auto- 
mobiles. These are equipped with 
numbered plates for identification, 
the plates being furnished by the 
two departments. Heretofore the de- 
partments have not paid the state for 
license tags and have not used the 
numbered tags of the motor vehicle 
department.

cently issued a“ ruling to the effect 
that the city was not required to pay

MEXICO GOING AHEAD. 

Several months ago the Obregon 
administration in Mexico an- 
nounced that under the new regime 
in that long war-ridden republic 
mHitary expenses would be greatly 
reduced and the saving applied to 
the promotion of peaceful activi- 
ties, notably education. 

That this commendable policy 
was not only backed by sincere in- 
tent, but is actually being carried 
out is indicated by subsequent de- 
velopments. 

For example, a recent news dis- 
patch from Mexico City said that 
the Mexican government has 
bought eighty buildings in the cap- 
ital and the federal district, its 
purpose being to immediately con- 
vert them into school buildings, 

These buildings will be for tem- 
porary use only, however, for, says 
the news report, the governmen: 
has worked out a comprehensive 
educational program which calls 
for the erection of an ample num- 
ber of new permanent buildings 
for school purposes, and in accord- 
ance with which it is about ready 
to begin operations. 

The dispatch goes on to say that 
among the first of the proposed 
nodern school buildings to be built 
will be “those destined for what 
the education department terms 
‘technical uses.’” These includs 
business schools, schools of trad®s 
and industries, railway, agriculture 
and other occupational schools. 

The new budget for Tree public 
education in Mexico “calls for some 
60,000,000 pesos, which is six times 
any previous Mexican budget for 
the same purpose.” 

The report does not say definitely 
whether or not this increase in the 
educational budget represenis, 
wholly or in part, a simultaneous 
curtailment of the military budget; 


but whether it does or does not, 


the fact of itself stands as a good 
and convincing indication that Mex- 
ico is advancing and going ahead in 
the right direction. 

Tie whole world, and this conn- 
try. in particular, will be pleased 
to yote Mexican progress along 
these lines. “ 

Developments of a peaceful na- 
ture across the Rio Grande will be 
watched with keen and sympathetic 
interest by all right-thinking Amer: 
icans. 


WORK AND SAVE. 

The best resolution for the New 
Year can be expressed in three 
words—Work and Save. 

Taking .stock of what was ac- 
complished by thrift and the sav- 
ing-habit in 1921, and the lessons 
learned thereby, is a good way to 
begin, profiting in the future by 
the experience of the past. 

As to what was done, or left un- 
done in the way of work and saving 
in 1921, The Montgomery Adver- 
tiser suggests these leading, per- 
sonal questions— 

“How have you come out this 
year? Is there any of the money 
for which you have probably worked 
hard to earn Jeft unspent? If not, 
has your year’s work been worth 
while? Are you getting anywhere? 
Nobody can answer these questions 
for you. You will have to anewer 
for yourself. Unless you have been 
the victim of misfortune it is your 
fault if you have saved no money 
this year.” 

That is the way to make the old 
year give an accounting as to its 
gains and losses—with honest an- 
swers to those searching ques- 
tions, to find wherein and why was 
the falling off—if there was any— 
and to plan and build better for 
every day of 1922. 

“The time to save is now.” 

_ That's the right word, and the win- 
ning one in making a fresh start.

WEAKENED BY DEATH. 

Seldom if ever before in Amer- 
ican history has a state lost so 
much of political power and pres- 
tise at the hand of the Grim 
Reaper as has Pennsylvania in the 
deaths of Senators Knox and Pen- 
rose within the last three months. 

Knox, died suftenly on last Oc- 
tober 12; Penrose, half an hour be- 
fore the incoming of the New Year. 

Each was a power of the first 
magnitude both in the senate and 
within the councils of the repub- 
lican party. 

The former. was the greater 
statesman of the two, but was out- 
shone by the latter as a political 
strategist. He was an authority on 
international law, with few supe- 
riors in contemporaneous pubiic 
life. He had seen service in the 
cabinets of Presidents Roosevelt 
and Taft, and he was an excep- 
tionally able lawyer, and a com- 
manding figure in the senate. 

His senior colleague, Penrose, 
was likewise a man of unusual in- 
tellectual force. He, too, was a 
figure of national prominence, who, 
for a quarter of a_ century, 
exerted an influence over the af- 
fairs of the United States govern- 
ment and particularly over the po- 
litical fortunes of other republicans 
and over the destiny of the re- 
publican party, second, perhaps, to 
that wiélded by none of his con- 
temporaries. 

Senator Knox was known and 
was powerful chiefly because of 
his high ability as a statesman; 
Senator Penrose, on the other hand, 
more because of his acumen and 
ruthlessness as a republican leader 
both in party councils and on the

floor of the senate. 

He was a worthy successor to 
his immediate predecessor, Senator 
Matthew Quay, and to his penulti- 
mate predecessor, Senator Came- 
ron, in command of the republican 
organization in Pennsylvania. 

This succession of men—Came- 
ron, Quay and Penrose—represent- 
ed the Keystone State in the sen: 
ate from the stirring days of the 
“sixties” down almost to the very 
beginning of 1922; and each of thei 
during his political lifetime was a 
man of outstanding national prom- 
inence and influence, whether for 
good or evil. 

With either Penrose or Knox in 
the flesh, Pennsylvania would have 
continued in the enjoyment of | 
marked prestige in congress and in 
the affairs of the government, es- 
pecially under a republican admin- 
istration; but with the death of 
both the influence of the Keystone 
State has suddenly dropped, from 
the pinnacle position it has occu- 
pied continuously since the civi] 
war, almost to the vanishing point. 
William E. Crow, appointed by 
Governor Sproul to fill the vacancy 
caused by the death of Knox, is not 
a man of strong politica] prestige; 
he is practically unknown outside 
the borders of his own statesand, 
furthermore, he himself is in poor 
health and has publicly declared 
that he will not seek election to tne 
senatorship. 

Whom Governor Sproul will name 
to succeed Penrose is not publicly 
known; but it is certain that he 
will not be a man of anything like 
the prominence of either Peurcse 
or of Knox, for the republican party 
in Pennsylvania contains no such 
man, 

Penrose was a supreme and un- 
disputed leader of the republican 
organization in his state; Knox was 
his undisputed second in command. 
Their successors can serve by

appointment only until the election 
of next November, when both va- 
cancies will be filled by vote of the 
people. ' 

Therefore the various political 
influences struggling for control of 
the republican organization, in 
Pentsylvania should soon manifest 
themselves, and as matters stand 
today the situation as to who will 
represent that state in the senate 
after next November is problematic. 

But whoever may be elected, the 
fact remains that from this time on, 
and probably for some years ts 
come—or until a real leader can be 
developed and attains that element 
of strength that comes only with 
long tenure—Pennsylvania must 
take a position of minor importance 
so far as its influence in the senate 
is concerned.

HEALTH TALKS| 


BY WILLIAM BRADY, M. D. |i 
SALT FOR HEADACHE. 


Persons accustomed to the daily use 
of physics are generally aware that 
an extraordinary dose of salts will re- 
lieve the headache associated with a 
costive state. Such persons are easily 
convinced that the relief of the head- 
ache is due to the removal of poison- 
ous matter of some kind from the 
blood by the purgative. So widespread 
is the erratic notion that many a lay- 
man takes it for granted that certain 
mysterious concoctions “purify the 
blood,’ and he spends many a good 
dollar on absurdities purporting to do 


but he also spends many days and 
weeks tampering with his health while 
taking such concoctions, which is of 
great importance. 

It happens tnat the headache com- 
monly occuring with costiveness is re- 
lieved by the salts long before the ca- 
thartic effect takes place—a fact which 
rather weakens the plausible argument 
that the removal of any poisoonus 
matter accounts for the relief of the 
headache are usually associated with, 
makes the theory that such headache 
is due to any poison retained or ab- 
sorbed into the blood very ques- 
tionable. : 
This and several other types of 
headache are usually associated with, 
if not directly caused by. an incerased 
pressure within the skull. This does 
no: mean that the sufferer is conselous 
of a sense of increased pressure, for 
yiat may occur when the tehsion or 
pressure is actually lowered, and as a 
rule the victim of a headache experi- 
ences no such sensation when we know 
the pressure is increased. (This does 
not refer to the blodd pressure partic- 
ularly.) The effect is more likely due 
to lewertog of the pressure within the 
skull. 

The same effect may be produced by 
common table salt and without ca- 
tharsis, 

Tablets or pills of common table 
salt, each containing a gram (151-2 
grains), and coated with salol, are 
given with good effect. and without 
any of the objectionable or harmful 
effects of the common painkillers pop- 
ularly used for the relief of headache. 
The purpose of coating the tablets or 
pills with salol i sto prevent solution 
and absorption of the salt until it 
reaches the intestine; salol is insolu- 
ble in the stomach. As a rule it is 
necessary for the patient to swallow 
eight or ten of these salt tablets or 
pills, taking two every five minutes, 
with as little water as possible to help 
them down. 

Here is a really harmless headache 
remedy. beneficial in practically all 
the milder forms of headache.

In other words there will be a 
an investigation of the alleged parti- 
san operations of the civil service com- 
mission~-all three members of which, 
incidentally, happen to be repubii- 
eans, contrary to law. 

The statutes provide that only two 
of the commissioners shall belong to 
the president's party, 

The situation complained of seems 
to be this: « 

Under the Wilson executive order 
the postmaster general wae required 
to send in the name of that applicant 
for a postofficg who made the high- 
est grade in the civil service examina- 
tions, there being no alternative ex- 
cept under the soldier preference or- 
der, or because of any actual impeach- 
ment of the character of the highest 
grade applicant. 

Under the Wilson order, therefore, 
scores of the largest postoffices in 
America were filled with republican 
postmasters, the republicans having 
been in power for many years prior 
to 1913, and many postmasters of 
that political faith having so grati- 
fied themselves that they naturally 
— the advantage of the examina- 
tions. 

I recall] that a great deal of com- 
plaint was heard from democrats. from 
all sections that too many republi- 
can postmasters were being ap- 


pointed. : 
Mr. Wilson took the position—-and 


able—that it would be dishonest to 
manipulate an executive order, in- 
tended to assure efficiency without 


Athens Herald is that the women who, 


just that, which is of no importance; 


regard to political preferment, to the 
end of protecting a party spoils sys- 
tem. He would not listen to any sug- 
gestion to destroy, break down or in 
any way weaken the force of his 
order that the high grades should be 
appointed, regardless of his political 
record or his party alignments. 

No right thinking democrat could 
get around the sincerity and the in- 
tegrity of the Wilson position; hence 
the postoffice personnel throughout 
the land, at one time the most for- 
midable factor known to the party 
in power, was eliminated absolutely 
from political influence or domina- 


tion. 
~ ” . * 


Under ‘the “Harding order, very 
adroitly framed io fool the people with 
one of Wilson's most notable ideals, 
the civil service commission is re- 
quired to certify to the president the 
three highest grade applicants, who 
may stand a so-called civil service 
postoffice examination, and the three,

If that is true then the order is 


not only a farce but the administra- 


tion furthering such tactics is guilty

in the old days of the spoils plan, 
It is further charged that where 
only democrats have appeared on eligi-

second and even’ third examinations, 


-the civil service commission, it is al-

texts by calling subsequent examina- 
tions so that the high grade demo- 
crates might be outlawed and a re-

Whether that charge is absolutely | 


true I am not prepared to say, but 
I do know that all over the United 
States, even in Georgia, exathinations 
have thrown out, even after 
eligible lists had been made and sub- 
mitted, and new examinations ordered. 

The civil service commission cannot 
deny thet. Why thrown out?

So far as I am concerned 1 am

who believes “to the victors belong 


the spoils’— 
But, if it is intended the postoffice 


department shall be absolved from po- 


litical influences, in the interest of 


‘business efficiency, then in Heaven's 


name let’s be honest about it and play 
the game on the top of the table. 
If President Harding and Post- 


master General Hays desire to abro- 


gate the civi] service order, and ap- 
point presidential’ postmastere from 
their party ranks, to meet political 
demands, pay political debts and 
build political fences, that is their 
business. Just let them say so, and 
go to it! 

If they expect the people to believe 
they are adhering to an executive 
order eliminating polities from the 
postal system then they must show 
their hand, and stop this monkeying 
with civil service examinations, or 
prove the charges to untrue— 

Hence the administration ought to

The Mayor’s Secretary 
States Mayor’s Position 
On the Bond Issue 


Editor Constitution: In view of 
Mayor Key’s absence from the city, 
[ deem it proper for me to cali to 
your attention the incorrectness of 
a statement contained in the edito- 
rial attack which you made upon 
him in Wednesday's issue of The 
Constitution. - sha 
‘The erroneous impression which 


| 


you conveyed with regard to the 
mayor's position tn the issuing of 
bonds by the city is one that you 
doubtless will be pleased to correct, 
You will recall that his only oppo- 
sition to bonds was to the bond 
issue which was being advocated 
by your paper and subsequently 
was recommended by the finance 
committee as a means of providing 
for the emergency needs of the 
school department. On this matter 
the mayor took the position that 
the most feasjpbke way of meeting 
the situation was by an extra tax 
levy, and urged that the amount 
of money needed to liquidate a de- 
ficit of $400,000 and improve the 
school buildings be secured by a 
tax assessment of one-half of 1 per 
cent. He stated that he did not 
favor the schoo] bond issue of 
$1.000,000 as the most expedient so- 
lution, But would insist upon the 
emergency tax. 
The mayor addressed council on 
the position of the people in this 
matter, and, as evidence of their 
willingness to be taxed, related the 
happenings in his campaign for re- 
election, wherein the public was ad- 
vised that an extra tax levy would 
be necessary and that if he was 
re-clected that he would advocate 
it: He stated that the question of 
public schools and the immediate 
application of an emergency tax, 
to provide better school facilities, 


comstituted the platform on which 
he ran for re-election and that it 


had been indorsed overwhelmingly 
by the citizens. 

When the ordinance calling for 
a school bond election of $1,000,000 
was defeated in council, the emer- 
gency tax of forty-five one »hune- 
dredths of 1 per cent was adopted 
and promptly made effective. About 
thé same time, Hon. W. W. Gaines, 
president of the board of educa- 
tion, was advocating, through the 
columns of the press, a bond issue 
of $5,000,000 as necessary to meet 
permanent improvements and need 
ed expansion in schools. In _ this 
he had the approval of Mayor Key. 
Both the mayor and_ President 
Gaines were of the opinion, how- 
ever, that the extra tax assessment 
was necessary for immediate use, 
thereby assuring a definite and 
prompt remedy for the deplorable 
conditions that existed in the schogl 
department. 

Mr. Robert C. Alston publicly ad- 
vocated a tax levy of one-fourth of 
1 per cent to cover deficit of $4090,- 
000, and suggested that council “re- 
quest the public to accept it as a 
duty.” - Judge George Hillyer ap- 
peared: before the committee in op- 


positian to both the band issue 
and tax levy, but gave as his opin- 
ion that the tax levy was preferable 
if either. were adopted. 


f am positive that Mayor Key did 
not at any time oppose the recent 
bond issue of $8,850,000, but to the 
contrary, exerted every ounce of 
his energy in its behalf. If the 
mayor has ever opposed the issu- 
ing of bends for public improve- 
ments, except for the fight which 
he was forced to make against the 
$1.000,000 issue, in defense of his 
pre-election policy, of assessing an 
extra tax for thie emergency, I have 
no knowledge of it. 

it igs not my desire in any way 
to enter into the controversy ben 
tween the mayor and yourself, but 
I consider it, nevertheless, my duty 
to bring to your notice this mis- 
statement of facts. I trust that 
you will, In fairness tn Mr. Key, 
review the incidents mentioned 
above, and correct the mistaken 
impression which is carried in your 
editoria]. Yours very truly,

OF 


WOODROW WILSON’S 
BIRTHDAY 


(From The Brooklyn ‘Eagle.) 

A former president's § birthday 
should be a personal matter of but 
slight public interest, Woodrow 
Wilson's sixty-fifth anniversary is 
an-exception. It has attracted wide 
attention for many reasons. His 
gradual, though apparently steady, 
improvement in health is gratify- 
ing. He is stil] an invalid, but his 
intellect remains unimpaired and 
he is keenly alive to what is hap- 
pening in the world, although liv- 
ing in seclusion. : 

But the interest in Mr. Wilson 
has a deeper significance, It springs 
from the fact that the battle in 
which he fell wounded is still going 
on. The. principles he propounded 
are the livest issues of the world 
today. To a remarkable degree he 
has been vindicated by his politica) 
enemies during the months he has 
been in retirement. Time, events, 
slow-working publie opinion, the 
law of mutation are all contribut- 
ing to that vindication. 

Woodrow Wilson made mistakes, 
but his vision remains what it was. 
and it has grown in magnitude sfnce 
hesleft office and became removed 
from the petty conflicts and contro- 
versies of politics. He was ahead 
of his time. Hig purposes were 
too far in advancé to be grasped at 
once. Happily he has lived long 
enough, apart from the struggle, 
for the world, includfng his oppo- 
nents, to catch up.

SET YOURSELF TO THE TASK. 


There is nothing that so withers the 
soul as aimlessness, 

A large number of our sad failures 
melt away like the mist before the 
hot sun just the minute that we set 
ourselves to a particular task and 
work into it. 

If you should ask me how to suc- 
ceed, I would immediately reply: 
Have something useful in your mind 
to de—and then do it! 

No matter how much we gain in 
material things or how much we own, 
we are, in the last analysis, merely 
tenants, And the test of our steward- 
ship is whether we remain faithful 
and true. _ 

History is a record of humans crum- 
bling into dust. But what those hu- 
mang aétomplished remains as the 
fresh inspiration of all history. 

William Knox, in his great poem, 
asks why the spirit of mortal should 
be proud, 

We should bathe our hearts in hu- 
mility—and see.in the larger good of 
ife the supreme reason why we 
should set ourselves to some partic- 
ular task, and complete it. 

The time is so short at the longest 
—"“the mere waft of a breath.” 

I am very sure that there is no time 


for regrets, or for ill feeling toward 
any human in the world. ‘There are 
too many important things to be done 
~and there are so few big visioned 
me to lead.

ushered in a year 
that was replete 
with events of 
great import to 
the governments 
of the worldand 
to humanity at 
large. 

That was the 
year when the 
democratig party 
recovered the na- 
ti@al government 
from the whiegs. 
The latter had 
elected General 

Sam W.Smail, Zachary Taylor in 
1844, who died akmost immediately 
after his“ inauguration and was 
succeeded by Millard Fillmore, vice 
president, who gave a very indiffer- 
ent administra¢gon. . 

In 1852.the democrats nominated 
General Franklin Pierce, of New 
Hampshire, the only man ever named 
for the high office from 80 small 
and uninfluential a state. Pierce 
had been a good soldier, a good sen- 
ator and a staunch democrat, ac- 
ceptable to the south as a safe man 
coming from a growing unsafe and 
abolitionist section; so Pierce was 
elected and verified the prediction of 
one of his home constitutents to the 
effect that “Frank Pierce is big 
enough all right for New Hamp- 
ahire, but when they spread him 
over the whole union he'll lay 
damn thin!” 

But before Pierce was through 
my juvenile fly-paper memory be- 
gan to catch and hold the biggest 
buzzing’ occurrences, 

Really the first lasting impres- 


-rsion made upon my mental tablets, 


back of which all is a blank, was 
the high day of the presidential 
campaign of the democrats in 1856 
in Knoxville, Tenn., the town of my 
nativity, 

Their candidates were James 
Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, for pres- 
ident, eand John Cabell Brecken- 
ridge, of Kentucky, for vice presi- 
dent. The campaign halloo was 
“Buck and Breck,” and the slogan 
“The Union-and the Constitution.” 

By the way, as a kid of five years 
of age, I had an awful time that day 
trying to spell out and find out 
that long word “Con-sti-tu-tion” 
that flamed on the banners and 
streamers in the procession. It im- 
pressed me as something wonderful, 
mysterious and important and has 
hung high in my gray matter ever 
since. My inherent respect for it 
probably accounts’for my ‘decision, 
nearly twenty years later, on ré- 
turning to Atlanta from Texas to 
seek and get a newspaper reporter's

Job on “The Constitutjon.” Queer

But that day Jn Knoxville, in 1896,

GEORGIA FARMERS 
ARE OPTIMISTIC, 
’ DECLARES PERRY 


Farmers of southwest Georgia 
“have burned their bridges. behind 
them,” have forgotten all about the 
boll weevil and losses on low-priced 
cotton and are working ag. never be- 
fore to make great’ erops this year. 
not only in cotton, but in a large va- 
riety of other farm products, accord- 
ing to James A. Verry, associate 
member of the state railroad commis- 
sion, who returned to Atlanta Thurs- 
day from an inspection trip through 
Clay, Terrell, Dougherty, Sumter and 
Macon counties, 

“I never saw farmers in our state 
as active as they are down “there 
now,’ Mr. Perry said. “They seem 
to be as busy now as they -usually 
are during the early spring. They 
are working gardens, making winter 
crops and preparing the ground for 
the new crop with absolute enthusi- 
asm.” 

Mr, Perry said he was surprised to 
find such an —— spirit exist- 
ing among the farmers, ' 

“Why, they've forgotten all about 
hard times and are talking about 
nothing but what is in the future,” 
Mr. Perry said. “Not only the farm- 
ers, but the bankers.and business men 
I met: are enthuiastic. It can be pfe- 
dicted safely that in that particular 
section of Georgia they ane going to 
give hard times a battle never put 
up before.”

depot matter for the commission and

New York, January 5.—Thoughts 
while strolling around New York. ‘The 
world cries for a Messiah in art. And 
overlooks the window dressers, Victo- 
rias bearing haughty shoppers. ‘here 
is Leddy Royce, the atdke director 
from Daly’s in London. ‘weeds and 
everything. 

Nobody rides in the triple-turreted 
street cars. A new play of life in 
the rugged mountains. ‘The same old 
motif: “Drap that gun, durn ye!” 
Hoodiums fishing for lost coins 
through the subway gratings. 

Frock-coated floor walkers doing 
their luneh constitutional. Innocent 
philanderers hurrying nowhere. A 
playwright’s club filled with serious 
thinkers weaving the warp and woof 
of romance. Cries’. of . “Warp!” 
Warp!” And “Woof! Woof!” A lady 
lawyer and her poet husband. Fact 
and fancy. | 

Flower shops and candy stores. Or- 
chids are now in bad taste. ‘The 
young man sends a single rose. And 


social gambling fad is reflected in the 
big stores. ‘They now have “Drawing 
Room Gambling” departments. 
Wonder what I'll do about all those 
Christmas bills?

UNUSUAL INTEREST | 


SHOWN IN CONCERT 
OF RACHMANINOFF 


- The sale of seats opens today at 
the Cable piano store for Wednesday 
night’s recital by Sergei Kachmani- 
noff, the celebrated Kussian composer- 
pianist, and the interest already man- 
ifested by music lovers in Atlanta and 
the towns near by ifidicates an excep- 


itionally large audience. 


Rachmaninoff is a magic name 
among lovers of the piano. For years 
he has been recognized as the great 
exponent af modern Kussian music, 
and his compositions have been Jarge- 
ly responsible, for the hold which the 
Russian school has taken on the pub- 
lic within the last decade. His pre- 
ludes and other compositions have 
taken their place among the “clas- 
sics,” and have become familiar to 
concertgoers. through their inclusion 
on the programs of ‘all the leading 
pianists. 

Rachmaninoff’s recital in Atlanta 

two seasons ago was one of the out- 
standing features of the Music Study 
club’s series, and it was the success 
of that recital which led the club this 
geason to urge that he be brought here 
again. 
._ The advance demand for seats indi- 
cated by mail ordérs promises an un- 
usually large audience, drawn from 
many miles around. The seats are of- 
fered at the usual prices, ranging from 
$1 to $2, plus the war tax.

“BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON, 
Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, January 5.—(By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.)—The New- 
berry case, which will come up in 
ue senate tomorrow under special or- 
r, will become one of the big is- 
sues of the approaching congressional 
campaigns. : 
* It matters not what the final re. 
sult may be, and it is much in doubt 
and will remain so until Newberry 
makes his formal statement on the 


floor of the senate, the issue will 


be ‘capitalized by the*democrats, abet- 


| ted by the group of progressive repub- 


licans who are actively fighting the 
Michigan senator who is acknowledged 
te be holding a $200,000 seat. 

. Today at the capitol it was reported 
that Senator Frelinghuysen had been 
transferred from the Newberry col- 
umn to the doubtful column. He re- 
eently requested Senator Borah, Ida- 
ho, to campaign for him next fall 
among New Jersey progressives. 

fo Borah Is Terse. 


“Will it make any difference to you 
how I vote on the Newberry case?’ 
be asked Borah. 

“If you vote to seat Newberry, 
there’s no use of your running for 
re-election,” Borah replied. “You will 
be defeated.” 

' The progressives, in their efforts 
to keep a jump or two ahead of the 
democrats in this matter, however, 
have their work cut out for them. 
The democrats are stirring up a lot 
of dust, with an eye on the autumn 
campaign. From their viewpoint, in. 
cidentally, it will be.a happier out- 
come if’ the g. 0. p. majority suc- 
ceeds in keeping Newberry in the 
senate. 

Aimed at President. 


The la*est drive by the democrats 
is being aimed at President Harding 
himself. They want to force him 
¢4o take a definite stand in the mat- 
ter. Some time ago there were ru- 
mors about the senate that Harding 
had sent word to certain republican 
leadets expressing the hope that they 
would vote for Newberry, but these 
mumors were denied by republican 
leaders. The president, the latter 
said, has taken and will take no 
part in the fight. ~° 
“The democrats, however, argte that 
the president already has taken a part 
in it by entertaining Newberry at 
the white house and at the theater, 
while his case was on trial in the 
senate. It is anticipated that repeat- 
ai. references to this action will be 
heard during the debate starting, fo- 
morrow. 

Republican leaders were engaged to- 
day in endeavoring to arrange advan- 
tageous pairs for absent members. 

emocratic senators laughed at the 
suggestion that a pair be arranged 
fér -Senator Crow, of Pennsylvania, 
who is too ill to attend sessions. 

Since Crow cannot be here to vote, 

they said, it would’ be wasting a vote 

' pair against him a senator who 

din get here. 

Newberry in Washington, 

S Newberry arrived in Washington 
day for a council of war with his: 
anagers, Senators Spencer and 
wnsend. 

After his talk with Spencer, New- 

rry told his friends he had def-, 
igitely decifled: tg make a ‘speech ih, 
is own defense. Fe 

“This may help his cause some wit 

such senators as Willis, of Ohio, who 

openly declared that the refusal ot 

Newberry to appear before the com- 

ther or make a statement on the 

f

” 
* 


or of the senate, could only be 

nstrued as an evidence of guilt. At 
ajiy rate, the Newberry case is fully 
‘Tgunched as a campaign issue.

Not to Take Cash 
Bonus If Possible 


“BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. 
Constitution Bureau, 
Raleigh Hotel. 


Washington, January 5.—(By Con- 
stitution Leased Wire.)—Robert G. 
Woodside, national commander of the 
veterans of foreign wars, has issued 
a call for advance pledges from vet- 
erans of the world war not to accept 
a cash bonus unless they absolutely 
need money to relieve immediate dis- 
tress. He has alko called for a com- 
mittee of 10,000 veterans to spread 
the doctrine of accepting adjusted 
service certificates of land and home 
aid instead of cash. 

After a conference -with Senator 
McCumber, sponsor of the soldier’s 
bonus bill in the senate; Senator 
James Watson, of Indiana, member 
of the finance committee, and Con- 
gressman Roy Fitzgerald, of Ohio, 
chairman of the veterans’ organiza- 
tion in the house, Commander Wood- 
side said: 

Fear Cash Demands. 

“The senators and congressmen 
want to pass the -bonus or adjusted 
compensation bill at:this session, .but 
they seem afraid that every veteran 
would immediately demand*his bonus 
in cash. This is far from true, and 
the veterans of foreign wars will or- 
fanize a committee of 10,000 to prove 
to congress that it is not the case. 
The Fordney-McCumber bill iacludes 
several provisions much more valua- 
ble to veterans than the cash bonus. 

“The adjusted service certificates, 
which consist of a paid-up insurance 
policy with definite loan value, are 
worth several times as much to a vet- 
eran as the cash bonus. The land 
and home &i:id section offers him 40 
per cent more than the cash section, 
if he applies the money on buying a 
city or country home. We anticipate 
that 90 per cent of the veterans woul 
accept’ these options rather than the 
cash bonus. Only those veterans in 
distress will choose the cash option. 

Prefers Insurance. 

“Our organization is offering its 

services through its thousand posts 
and 100,000 active members, to organ- 
ize sentiment in favor of accepting 
the more subsvantial benefits. We do 
this in confidence that congress will 
fulfill the promise of many. members 
of both houses that the adjnsted com- 
pensation ~ bill will be passed at this 
session. 
“We have not the least doubt that 
once the bill is passed the former 
service men will accept $3 in paid- 
up insurance, with a government loan 
guarantee, rather than $1 in easb. 
This is especially true because the bill 
spreads the cash payment over two 
or three years in small quarterly sums. 
“We insist that the cahs feature 
be ‘retained, because a certain num- 
ber of veterans are unemployed, or 
facing severe family distress requiring 
immediate aid. But we will certainly 
urge -every veteran to take the -insur- 
ance or the home aid, which are 
worth much more to him:and more to 
the country.”

BY JAMES A. HOLLOMON. | 


Raleigh Hotel. 
Washington, Janoary 5.—(By C 


stitution Leased Wire.)—Ten immi- 


gration “commandments” have been 


adopted by authorities on immigration 


legislation. They declare that the 
time has come when America must, 


not only for its own sake but also for 


the good of the world, adopt certain 


fundamental principles regarding the 


coming. of foreigners to her shores. 

The “ten commandments” as put in 
brief form by Dr. Sidney L. Gulick, 
executive secretary of the national 
compiittee for constructive immigra- 
tio legislation, are as follows: 

é Ten “Commandments.” . 

1. Immigration should be regulated 
and selected both in quantity and in 
quality. : 

2. No more immigration should be 
admitted of any nationality than we 
can wholesomely assimilate and in a 
reasonable length of time wisely ‘in- 
corporate into our body politic. 

3. No more immigration should be 
admitted than can find steady and 
useful employment without. endanger- 
ing normal American standards of 
life, labor antl wages. : 

Should Be Flexible. 


4. The numerical regulation of im- | 


migration should be flexible. When 
industrial depression sweeps the 
country, all labor immigration shoyld 
be promptly stoppej. But the doors 
should again be opened when prosper- 
ity returns. It should be possible to 
take either step without waiting for 
special congressional action. | 

5. The closing and openings of our 
doors should be scientific. It should 
be based or assured and accurately 
compiled facts and statistics from 
every part of the country. 

6. The law should be general. The 
principles should be applied equally 
to every nation and people without 
arbitrary discrimination. 

Should Be Courteous, 

7. The law should be courteous to 
all. It should. be possible, without 
humiliating any, to completely stop 
particular types of immigration which 
definite experience shows to be diffi- 
cult to assimilate and absorb. 

8 The law should provide for the 
sending of expert examiners to the 
lands from which immigration comes 
—this for the sake of both prospective 
immigrants and of our own land. 

9. The law should make _ possible 
a wise distribution of new immigra- 
tion. The flow should be restricted or 
é¢ntirely stopped from given periods, 
to already congested areas, and en- 
couraged to go to those parts of 
America where it is desired. 

Should Be Patriotic. 

10. The new immigration policy 
should be distinctly patriotic. It 
should favor immigration from peo- 
ples easily assimilated and check it 
from other Jands. It should guaran- 
tee fair treatment to all aliens now 
in the United States. It should pro- 
vide for higher standards for naturali- 
zation and then grant the privileges 
of citizenship to all who qualify. It 
should look to the creation of a sub- 
stantially homogeneotis people. having 
a common mind, and a wholesomely 
functioning democracy. ne 

The Sterling immigration bill is said 
to be based on these “fundamental 
commandments” which place the needs 
of America first.

Affiliation Is Urged 


At the first regular meeting of the 
Atlanta Automotive Equipment asso- 
ciation to be held this yedr, the ques- 
tion of affiliation with the Atlanta 
Automobile Dealers’ association wil] 
be considered. D. C. Black,. presi- 
dent, and C., V. Hohenstein, secre-

appear before the equipment. deéal-

ing will. be held at the Daffodil at 
12:30 o'clock Friday. 

It was pointed out by President 
Black Thursday that both organiza- 
tiens were working to improve trade 


to foster legislation and practices 
that would encourage the, construc- 
tion of better ‘roads, and in other 
ways make the owners’ investment in 
motor transportation of more value 
to himself and*the community. 

It is the opinion of Mr. Black and 
others: in both associations that the 
two organizations would benefit if 
their identity and efforts were merged 
into one body, since both are working 
for the same purpose,~in almost ev- 
ery instance.

SUPREME COUNCIL 
IN SESSION TODAY 
Continued from First Page. 


only official announcement after 
these talks was fthat the conversa- 
tions were proceeding satisfactorily. 
Today’s developments seemed to con- 
firm the impression that the allies 
are agreed upon the principle of an 


bating the details. 


Reparations .were discussed by the 
experts today, the Belgians stoutly 
opposing any modification in the 
schedule of payments that likely 
would compromise their priority on 
the 2,500,000.000 gold marks due by 
Germany. The French delegation is 
backing the: Belgians on this point, 
but it is inclined to make concessions 
to the British viewpoint to the extent 
of reducing the cash payments to 
500,000,000 gold marks annually and 
the rest of the reparaticas in kind. The 
British go farther than this and de- 
sire- to reduce the deliveries in kind 
so that .the total both in cash and in 
kind can be reduced about 25 per cent 
from the Paris agreement, of 1,500,- 
000,000 gold marks. 


Participation by Gormany in the 
eventual international etonomic con- 
ference is now taken fur granted, but 
there still is discussio2 as to what 
would be the consequences of the 
presence of Russien soviet delegates, 
which it is held in Fiench circles, 
would be tantamount to. recognition 
of the bolshevik regime. The. British 
experts agree that an irvitation to 
the Moscow government to send dele- 
gates to the conference would be! 
equivalent to de facto recognition, 
while the jurists attached to the del- | 
egations say there is little difference 
between de facto and de jure recog- 
nition: 

The Italians are strongly support- 
ing the idea of a full eonference, 
comer iene the Russians, as princt- 
pals. Be

the republican administration a large 
share of blame for the present indus- 
trial slump, which, he said, had cost 
the United States a “panic loss” of 
$405000,000,000. 

America, he declared, was in a 
“wonderful condition” at the close of 
the war, with a national wealth of 


nearly $300,000,000,000; an interna- 
tional commerce: of $75,000,000,000; 
a gold supply of $3,079,000,000: for- 
eign commerce of $10,300,000,000; 
trade balance-of $4,000,000,000 ; a for- 
eign indebtedness in our favor of 
more than $11.000,000,000 ; 
savings of $15,000,000,000, 
grea: mepfcantiie marine. 
Nation Was Prosperous. 

“The nation was immensely pros- 
perous,” he continued. “We had be- 
come the center of world finance and 
commerce. We had no inflation of 
currency and no uncontrollable infla- 
tion ‘of credit. The other half of the 
world was starving for our surplus. 
Every banker and kusinesS man was 
then predicting for America an unin- 
terrupted period: of unparalleled pros- 
perity. 


and a 


“Why, then, did this nation later | 


plunge over the oconomic precipice? 
Why did every prediction made dur- 


and financiers for the first time com- 
pletely fail?’ 

The answer, he declared, was that 
America failed to recognize the ne- 
cessity of extending credit to stricken 
Europe until she could get back on 
her feet. 


Could Have Averted Crash. 


The economic co-operation and co- 
ordination practieed by allied nations 
during the war was completely dis- 
solved, he said, resulting in an eco- 
nomic debacle throughout Europe, 
which could have been averted had 
America, with other. nations which 
came out of the war relatively intact, 
extended a helping hand to the dis- 
organized, but potentially rich, coun- 
tries of centgal Europe. 

Failing t6 get credit extension, he 
said, these countries were driven to 
a paper money basis, which shatter- 
ed foreign exchange and eventually 
made it impossible for Europe to buy 
in America the surplus supplies* she 
so much needed. 

Thus, American foreign trade was 
“choked to death,” and _ industrial 
stagnation in the United States was 
inevitable. 

“I have offered these observations,” 
he concluded, “in an effort to ascer- 
tain what lessons America can learn 
by which to profit in the future. 

Lesson of Co-operation.

that hereafter this nation must reec- 
ognize that world economic conditions

and the entire official personnel of 
the club will compose an informal 
hospitality committee, and the artists

ings. 

Invitations Sent Out. 

The club has sent invitations to its 
members for this coming Saturday to 
bring new members and remain for 
tea. It may be anticipafed that both 
suggestions will be accepted. since 
the midwinter social lull will give 
added luster to these social-artistic 
events, and since the extraordinary 
character of the musical attractions 
ta be provided as a part of member- 
ship privilege will easily stimulate 
the membership interest. 

Of the artists to appear in the Sat- 
series there is Nelsen Illing- 
for instagexe, who gives his 
song recital Janu@ry 7. <A _ typical 
first appearance of this unique figure 
in the musical life is described as fol- 
lows: 


Lincoln in Musie. 


“The concert hall suddenly become 
hushed. The accompanist apytears 
amid polite applause. There comes 
2 moment of eloquent silence follow- 
ed by a gasp as Nelson Illingworth, 
the Australian singer, appears. The 
gasp becomes a whisper and the 
whisper forms one audible word— 
“Lincoln!” The audience is too 
amazed to applaud and continues te 
stare until some well-poised soul re- 
members and the handclapping be- 
gins.’ 

Such is Mr, Illingworth’s greeting 
wherever he appears. Even those 
who have seen and heard him many 
times are always freshly jolted to 
see this living image of Abraham

sociate with Lincoln. His huge 
hands and feet, the clothes . that 
somehow, although carefully pressed,

proached many times in the hope 
that he would appear on the legiti- 
mate stage as Lincoln.

knows how to act witk his voice. He 
is a very great artist. His art has 
often been @mpared to Ladwig Wull- 
ners but he has a better voice.”

esting. will be the concert on Satur-

with him. It may te his teeth. or it 


may be his stomach, out whatever it is 
it should be looked after both for his 
health’s sake and for the sake of keep- 
ing on friendly terms with his friends.

A Third Way. 
The third way in which people spoil 
themselves when they open their 
mouths is by their voices. Haven’t you 


seen a thoroughly pretty girl some- 
where and been delighted with her 
prettiness until she opened her mouth 
and out came a voice that spoiled the 
whole effect? Perhaps it was nasal, 
perhaps it was sharp and high pitched, 
perhaps it had that peculiar roughness 
that seems to go with lack of educa- 
tion and breeding. And weren't you 
reminded of the peacock and the lav- 
ish way,she has been given beauty of 
plumage and ugliness of voice? But 
the peacock is excusable and some of 
the voices we wi are not.

old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Milton 
L. Parks, of Decatur, is now the hap- 
py owner of a home for her small 
tamily. 

The own-your-own-home slogan evi- 
dently made a deep impression on 
little Miss Parks with the result that 
she was declared the winner in the 
contest recently conducted by the 
Home for the Friendless for the ben- 
efit of the laundry conducted at the 
home. The doll house was made, 
painted and donated to the home by 
the Tripod Paint company through 
Mrs. W. L. Campion, chairman of 
the laundry committee. This com- 
mittee is composed of the following: 
Mrs. L. B. Hambright, Mrs. J. S. 
Windsow. Mrs. Hal Steed, Mrs. Lee 
Hagan, Mrs. P. L. Blackshear, Mrs. L. 
©. Mathews, assisted by Mrs. Claud 
Shewmake, Miss Harriet Shewmake 
Jenkins, Mrs. Fred Patterson, Mrs. 


E. M. Veach, Mrs. J. C. Pasco, Mrs. 
Albert Akers, Mrs. Charles Andrews, 
Mrs. Ridley Harwell, Mrs. Joe Crum- 
bly, Mrs. W. H. Buss, Mrs. George 
Brine, Mrs. Edward Walker. 
The laundry is operated in the 
small room in the yard of the Home 
for the Friendless on Highland ave- 
nues. Clothes and bedding of all 
kinds are washed twice a week for 
92 children. The larger children, with 
the help of a colored laundress, who 
twice weekly launders 1,500 garments. 
The larger boys of the home carry 
the baskets filled with fresh, snow- 
white garments to the various dormi- 
tories and the nursery. Here these 
garments are counted and put away 
by each matron of the different de- 
partments, The committee in charge 
of this special work in the home, un- 
der the leadership of Mrs. Champion, 
is accomplishing most effectual and 
excellent results in the home.

ant dance, the motif of “The Goose 
Girl,’ which is the feature film of

chairman of the committee chaperon- 


ing on this date and assisting her 
will be a group of members of the

there on Saturdays and accomplish 
many errands, their marketing and 
shopping during the program, calling 
later for them.

BY ANNE RITTENHOUSE 


Every wind that blows from the di- 
rection of fashions that are marching 
over the horizon tells of the extraordi- 
nary popularity of the cape. It is 
not a long serviceable wrap for pro- 
tective purposes, but a thing of brav- 
ado .and foolishness. It is for coquet- 
ry, not warmth. James I. wore such 
a cape. Sir Walter Raleigh threw 
ene before a queen. 

It ig an admirable background for 
a simple frock, but it is an ex- 


» crescence for. an ornamental gown, 


It is intended to give fullness and 
grace to whatever is straight of line 
and pilgrim-like ix its simplicity. It 
should divert attention to itself away 
from the frock. 
hesitancy Yn flaunting the most 
blazing lining, such as flowered foul- 
ard, brocade, bright duvetyn, Rus- 
si 1 embroideries. It is not in the 
fashion at all if it has a sober in- 
terior. Its purpose in life, its reason 
for existence, is to give an ornate 
and figured background to a somber 
gown. It is another way the dress- 
makers have of persuading women 
that color is as appropriate in art as 
in nature, a truth which the major- 
ity appears to have forgotten. , 

As none of the crepe fabrics are 
relinquished for the present season, 
regardless of the fact that the cal- 
endar, and. sometimes’ the ther- 
mometer, marks winter, «they are 
built into capes as. well as frocks, 
especially in. dark blue instead of 
black, in gray, in white, and in rust. 
The lining is more often of foulard 
th.n any other fabric for the design- 
ers have taken a_ strong fancy to 
make this once ugly, now lovely, 
msterial, a desirable one for warm 
weather. The way to do that is to 
emphasize it before warm~ weather 
arrives. We get our summer fashions 
in. January, you know, and our winter 
ores in August. 

When a dark -vrock of crene has 
a short eane lined with vivid color 
there is a pocket on the hip or the 
chest to hold a tiny colored linen 
handkerchief. This is one of the 
popular diversions of the season, to 
match of the pocket handkerchief 
to the embroidery or the cape lining. 
Women who have received these 
small bits of blazing color as gifts, 
esnecially . home-from-France _ gifts 
which have been plentiful this year, 
have looked upon the useless trifles 
with amazement . or indifference. 
They have wordered whv any friend 
shonld think .they would carry any- 
thing but a white - handkerchief.

colored handkerchiefs in ¢he breast

are put.on the hip of a skirt as a 
resting place for the linen square. 
Colored silk is just as fashionable 
as linen and sometimes easier to get. 

There is such admiration openly 
expressed for red in all shades this 
season that one finds the handker- 
chiefs mostly in this color. The mil- 
liner usually adds her bit by putting 
a red felt hat with a gown of har- 
monious color. The frocks that go 
to the pleasure grounds of February 
are white or gray with red felt hat, 
parasol, embroidered pocket and 
handkerchief. 

The beach cape is entirely réd or it 
is a dark color lined with a figured 
red fabric.

color is permitted or desired by the 
wearer, it shows in a leather belt

board of the hospital. Mrs. Brown, 
past president, automatically 
comes the other representative or- 
dained to serve in this capacity. 

Mrs. Adams stated that the women 
have begun to realize for the first 
time their hopes in working for the 
mental and manual training of the 
children who are patients at the hos- 
pital. Miss Maude Moomough, the 
grade teacher, who goes to the bed- 
side of a child, if the occasion is 


) 


necessary, reported that one child 
had made three grades by studying 
during the convalescent period. — 

Miss Hume, teacher of occupation-, 
al therapy, has taught basketry anc 
woodcarving during the past few 
months, thereby giving the children 
great pleasure, and aside from tha@ 
feature, muscular development fol- 
lows in this work. One particularly 
beautiful tray was made by a child 
with one free hand, while the other 
lay in a plaster cast. 

Mrs. W. T. Downing, as volunteer 
kindergartener prepares and super- 
vises a program twice weekly for the 
childen. 

Many other committees serve dail 
at the hospital and take part in th 
splendid work of service which the 
woman’s auxiliary has, accomplished.

~ “Ts he killed, doctor? Is le dyin’?” 
Whispered hushed, choking voices. “Is 
he gone?” 

“No, no!” the doctor answered, 
“but get him into my auto, quick! 
We haven’t got a moment to lose!’ 


Yellow-white with fear, Muggs gent- | 


ly picked up the bleeding, gusping 


man, and carried him out of the Hav- | 


en. The muted onlookers beheld in 
terror the brov:yl, spréading crimson 
stain that dyed Bradford's shirt—a 


stain collecting in heavy gouts which | 


drip-drip-dripped to the reddened saw- 
dugt, the sidewalk, the deep leather 
enshions of the doctor’s car as Muggs 
clambered into the runabout with the 
missioner in his powerful arms. 


Straight to the rear entrance of the’ 


hospital the doctor drove his car. 
Stretcher-bearers, issuing forth in 


hasie, received the gasping Bradford 
from the arms of Muggs, unwilling to 
let him go and violently protesting 
at being excluded from further par- 
ticipation. Without a second’s delay 
the bearers carried the wounded jan 
to the elevator, wbith soared aloft tu 
the operating room floor at the top of 
the building. 

Not five minutes after Bradford had 


‘heen carried into the hospital. he had | 


been stripped and etherized, bis 


wound had been “scrubbed up” and 
made superficially sterile, and be had 
been laid upon the steel and glass op- 
erating table. 

Dr. Tressor beckoned a nurse who 
had just entered from the sterilizing 
room), with a large tray. 


“All ready!” said he crisply. "Right |

Want any strangulation here!” 

The nurse took a pledget of cotton 
and walked around the head of the 
patient to the right side. Then,

“Doctor!” she said, tremblingly.

Beside the bed—but not too nea’,

The old shipmdSter, racked with un- 


availing remorse, was standing at the 
wide-open eastern window which over- 
looked the jumbled roofs of the water 
front and the broadly gleaming reaches 
of the harbor. : 

At the bed’s head, her eyes yearning 
upon the dying man’s face—eyes that 
shadowed in their deyths thc age-long 
and eternal crucifixion of all woman- 
kind—stood Sylvia. To her the pres-

had so bitterly wronged her, counted 
now for nothing. Every thought &nd

? 
Gravely Tressor turned and addrets- 


ed the old shipmaster. 

“I’m ‘glad yequ're here, Mr. Vinton, 
so that you can understand the situa- 
tion. Erankly, I had decided to pro- 
ceed extreme measures—to resort 
to blood transfusion. You understand, 
of course, how difficult and dangerous 
it wofld be, under the circumstances. 
The patient is very low, and sinking. 
A single clot, a single air bubble—” 

“Transfusion?” exclaimed Vinton, 
fixing strange eyes on the doetor’s 
face. “You need blood? Will mine 
do?” 4 

“Or mine?’ pleaded the 
with clasped hands. 

“No. I fear the situation is criti- 
cal.” Pressor answered. Every sec- 
ond is precious now. You don’t know 
—you can’t understand the problem. 
We need a plentiful supply of ab- 
solutely rich. pure. young, strong 
blood and vital blood. Nene is to be 
found imtime. Downstairs, two men 
and a crippled boy bave already of- 
fered—some of your son's proteges

Vinton winced.) Of course I had to

our son is—is—” 

The doctor beckoned Sylvia. 

“Miss Pennell,” said he, “kindly 
escort Mr. and Mrs. Vinton to the 
waiting room at the end of the hall.” 

His tone allowed no argument. The 
stricken parents followed Sylvia in 
trembling silence. At the door she 
stood aside to let them pass. A sec-

nearing completion, which “will be

Directors’ of physical education in the universities And colleges 
the United States, backed practically without opposition by the hundred 
or more coaches a8sembled jn New York, took a step which is certain 
to aid athletic sports in our schools. 
Realizing the perils Which confront collegiate sport, the. directors 
and coaches went on record as opposing entirely commercialism, prose- 
lyting and semi-professionalism, and called upon the colleges af the 
United States to check or stamp.out the evils. 

The sincerity of these men, eSpecially of the coaches, is: beyond

Some difference of opinion developed

The same thing happened when “ham

pursue the even tenor of its old ways 
rather than branch out as a ruling 
body. ‘There was some evidence that

Coach Bean Fears Spartanburg 


BY CLIFF WHEATLEY 


Carolinians Reach Atlanta Today 


“Of course, you are going to start 


Y. M. C. A. team Saturday night at 
the Auditorium,” this correspondent 
opined during a basketball talk with 
Joe Bean, coach of the Atlanta Ath- 
letic club’s quintet, last night. 

“Of course I am,” was Bean’s re- 
ply. “Just like I am going up to 
Juck Dempsey and tell him that’ I 
don't like his war record and that 


I think he is the biggest piece of 
vine I ever saw.” 

We took this statement to mean 
that Mr. Bean is expecting something 
besides peanut hulls to fly when the 
whistle blows for hostilities to. be un- 
corked. 

Luter, in the bleak climate of this 
particular section of the building 
erected by this standard southern 
newspaper, we talked the matter over | 
with Al Doonan, who knows every- 
thing about the A. A. C. players ex- 
cept the laundries that operate on 
their shirts. We have come to the 
conclusion that the clubmen will be 
intensely interested during the great- 
er portion of the struggle. 

Al brought along statistics of this 
Spart: inburg five. They loeked. rath- 
er complicated, but proved. beyond 
doubt that the Carolinians will be 
bard losers and might be worse win- 
ners. Frankly, it looks: to-be a cork- 
ing good game from this distance. 

Heeklin is a real basketball play- 
er. He has been.in the business long 
enough to absorb every angle of it. 
He is cool in action and packs dead- | 
ly accuraéy. He ts, sure to prove 
considerable of +a thorn ,before- the 


Leon, and his hundreds of friends here 


wish him success on the coast. 


LOOKS PRETY ROSY 
FOR “PIE” TRAYNOR. 

“Pie” Traynor, a real -ball player. 
who stumbled into the Southern league 
last year, where he played with Bir- 
mingham, may rest reasonably assured 
of a place on George Gibson's Pitts- 
burg team next season. 

Traynor, you will recall, was the 
“Ten-Thousand-Dollar Beauty” sent to 
Carlton Molesworth for further sea- 
soning last summer. He delivered the 
goods and was recalled by the Pirates 
at the close of the campaign. 

That George Gibson is “sweet” on 
the recruit may be gleaned from the 
interview below, given out recently by 
Manager Gibson: , 


“Somebdy told me Branch 
Rickey said Traynor was the best 
ball play er in-either major league. 
I admire Branch’s: judgment and 
echo his. sentiment... Now J'll go 
into details. -This boy ‘has ability 
sticking out all over him. He’s 
so good that I don’t know quite 
what to do with him; By. that. I 
mean that Icun put him anywhere 
on my team except in the box or 
behind the bat, and he'll make 
good for me. He'll play any posi- 
tion L want him to, but prefers 
shortstop, because he figures he’ll 
have more to do there than any- 
where else... 

“One day, at the training camp 
in Hot Springs. last spring, I put 
him on third base for the Yani- 
gans, and told hif to stick there 
until I told him to shift. You 


evening is over. ther prominent 
players with Spartanburg are Harris, 
forward; R. Vogel, center; Captain 
Howard ‘and Copeland, guards. 

The team reaches Atlanta this aft- 
ernoon and is slated for a workout 
at the club tonight at. 7 o’clocki 


GOVERNOR GROESBECK 
ON COMMERCIALISM. : 
‘Addressing a bunch of sporting men 
at «a banquet the other night, Gov- 
ernor Groesbeck, of Michigan, direct- 
ed an official fféwn in boxing’s di- 
rection, declaring ‘that the game was 
commercialized to the extent that ev- 
ery element of sportsmanship was: re- 
moved. 
Governor Groesbeck declined to-ex- 
tend his remarks to the condition of 


snow how the boys hit ’em do ‘ 
toward third: base in the springs 
When, for two days this i 
stopped everything they hit at’ 
him, and it was a treat to see him 
at work. On the third day he 
came to me-and said: ‘Mr. Gib- 
son, you know best, and if. you 
want me to stay at third base, 
I’m satisfied. But I would like to 
get away from there‘for a while.’ 

“*Why? I asked. ‘Because,’ he 
replied, ‘I don’t have anything to 
do there. - Put me at {shortstop for 
a few days, will you? 

“Can't beat that much, can you? 
‘I moved him over to the. short field 
and,.after a few days, I-knew..I 
had a priceless ball player, even if 
‘he was a year or so removed from 
major league class. I sent him to 
Birmingham when the season 
opened, and he just ran away with 


baseball at this writink, which leads 
us to wonder why Michigan’s chief! 
executive—if he’s going to talk about 
the sins of commercialism in sport- 
dom—did net take up this subject. 

Boxing is in the hands of people 
that are using the game for financial 
profit and for little else, but the situa- 
tion is not so-bad as it.is in base- 
hall, that is, in the professional pas- 
time. 

In pugilistic circles, the charges 
are at least denied. In baseball they 
form the basis for boasts of many 
moguls that they are interested only 
in the fipancial side of the sport. 

It’s all right to push the crusade 
against commercialism, but there is 


no use in starting after the little 
noise. Get the big one. ‘The writer 
thinks that baseball is far in the 
lead in the desire for annexing shekels 
io the utter disregard of every other 
consideration and a few knocks at the 
general tactics would not hurt, 


LL FRANCHISES’ “* 
TAKE MONEY. 

s owners of franchises in 
the “profeltonal baseball world. are 
so intent on corralling the dollars of 
ithe taxpayers, it is nothing but fair 
that the smaller clubs should be given 
every opportunity to make their hay 
while the sun is high. 

Therefore, The Constitution is in 
hearty approval-of the action of 
Southern league directors in giving 
Mobile, Chattanooga and Nashville 
larger cuts at the dividend,cake. The 
idea is to fix it so that there won't 
be any money lost during the coming 
caumipaign in the Southern league. 

It sounds fine this far away from 
the scene of the melon slice and should 
help the smaller boys to keep up with 
the grabbing of their more fortunate 
brothers. 


CHARLIE HIGH 1 LOST 
TO ATLANTA FANS. | 


Maybe you have heard the rumor 
that one of the deals Messrs. Spiller 
and Frank had in mind concerned 
Charlie High’s return to the lecal fold. 
it was more of the dope that. “listened 
well,” and Charlie would have been 
welcomed by Poncey addicts. . 

But it is all off: Dispatches from 
Philadelphia, where Connie Mack 
keeps his Contracts, indicate that. High 
iS going to the Portland club in the 
Pacific Coast circuit. Here.it is: 


“Thomas: Turner, manager of 
the Portland Coast league team, 
and former scout for the Ath- 
letics, has made deals with Con- 
nie Mack by which Portland. ac- 
uires Charlie High and Leroy 
ressett, outfielders, and Harvey 
Freeman. pitcher, Freeman is a 
former Kalamazoo Normal school 
pitcher; Gressett was purchased 
from San Antonio and finished 
the season with Evansville, and 
High was out under option with 
Columbus last season. He at one 
time played with Atlanta, in the 
Southern league.” 


Charlie has a brother in the Pacific 
Andy, 


another |’ 


the ledgue. The Pittsburg club 
paid $10,000 for him when he was 

@ green kid with the Portsmouth 
club of the Virginia league, and you 
couldn’t buy him from me’ now. 
Why, he’s one ef those oldsfash- 
ioned ball players who take a rea] 
delight in playing ball.’ . Baseball 
is the only thing in Jife worth 
while to him. When he isn't play- 
ing ball he’s talking about if., and 
I ‘believe he dreams about it at 
night.” 


CALIFORNIA INVITES 
CENTRE T@ PLAY DEC. 2 


Danville, Ky., January 5.—The 
University of California, athletic offi- 


‘cials have invited Centre college to 


fill the honor date on the 1922 foot- 


ball schedule, December 2%. On this 
date the annual homecoming celebra- 
tion will be held and the new $1,000,- 
QOO stadium dedicated. 

This announcement was made here 
today by Coach Charlie Moran, who 
said he would ask Centre’s athletie 
board at its next meeting to consider 
the invitation. 

The Colonels. returned ‘home [ast 
night from the far west, where they 
defeated the University of Arizona at 
San Diego, Cal., December 26, only 
to be decisively ‘beaten by the Texas 
A. & M. team at Dallas on Quarter- 
back “Bo’’ MeMillin’s wedding day, 
January 2. 


NEALE BELIEVES W. & J. 
WAS ROBBED ‘OF SCORE 


Los Angeles, January 9.—A 
charge that W ashington and Jefferson 
football team was “robbed” of a touch- 
down in its Scoreless game against 
the University of California at Pasa- 
dena Monday, has been voiced here 
by Earle Neale, W. & J. coach. 

Neale declared that H. H. Huebel, 
San Francisco, who was head lines- 
man, should not have called Stein, W. 
& J. star, off side on a play from 
which Brenkert, W. & J. back, carried 
the ball atréss:the California line. 

Other officials“do not agree with 
Neale, however,: say that Huebel 
blew his. horn, which called the of- 
side, even before. Brenkert had reach- 
ed the line of scrimfmage in his suc- 
cessful dash for‘ the*goal. Under the 
rules, the ball could not be brought 
back until the play had been com- 


pleted.

BOGART GOES 
TO PELICANS 


New York January 5.—Edward 
Bogart, outfielder, who has been on 
the Giants’ payroll and bench, but 
‘not on the playing team, has been 
released to the New Orleans club of 
the Southern association, Secretary 
Tierney, of the Giants, announced 
Thursday. 


There .are two reasons for John 
McGraw’s decision to teave his $75,- 
QOU outfielder, O'Connell, with the 
San Francisco club for a full season, 
after the purehase price has been 
paid. In the first place, MeGraw ex- 
plains, the San Francisco club lopped 
off a considerable chunk of the price 
first demanded in consideration of be- 
ing allowed to use the kid next year, 
in the seeond place O'Connell 
can well stand another year’s season- 
ing in daily phay with a minor league 
club, whith would benefit him more 
than a season on the splinters with 
the utility men of the Giants. 

McGraw has fully insured his new 
star for the 1922 season. Although 
a first baseman now, the kid is a nat- 
ural outfielder, according to McGraw, 
and will play the the prairie posi- 
tion when he joins the Giants, 


The Harvard football team, which 
introduced something new in the game 


last fall by playing a double-header 


on the first football date of the ‘sea- 
son, will not continue the practice. 
Middlebury eollege, holding the posi- 
tion of September 30 on the Harvard 
schedule, probably will provide the 
sole entertainment for the Crimson 
that day. It had been planned to play 
another small college the same after- 
noon. Centre college plays Harvard 
on September 21, and Florida, a new 
customer to Harvard, November 4. 


Jack Britton, who was believed to 
be one of the champions determined 
not to fight for Tex Rickard, has 
smashed his resolution to bits by 


{‘signing with Rickard to defend his 


welierweight title in not only one 
fight, but three, at Madison Square 
garden. Britton has fought here only 
once since decision bouts became le- 
gal, defeating Ted Kid Lewis that 
time in 1& rounds on points. He 
meets Jack Perry, the Pittsburg wel- 
terweight,.on January 27, and on 
subsequent dates, if victorious, will 
fight Dave Shade, of San Francisco, 
and Mickey Walker, of Jersey City. 


. The famous wooden bow! on Boyle’s 
30 acres, Jersey City,.may never be 
used for another’ Dempsey fight. The 
Jersey legislature will soon consider 
and probably pass a bill limiting the 
price of admission to a champion- 
ship fight te $15. In order to meet 
Dempsey’s immense idea of a cham- 
pionship purse,. the majority of the 
spectators at the Carpentier fight 
paid from $20 to $50 last July 2

ors against "Gene Tunnev, the ma- 
rine. in the garden here, January 13. 
Levinsky has not fought since Car- 
pentier’s right mitt slugged him in 
the fall of 1920.

Thursday morning, 
charge of high explosive which had! 
been left by the yeggmen would ex- 
plode, the employees of the company 
were careful to avoid it. 
jn opening the office 
ring ic was found that the bur- 
had left two fuses in the 
one of which had gone out a 
distance away from the ex- 
plosive. If the cracksmen had been 
successful in their attempt, it was 
stated. nothing of value would have 
been lost, as the safe contained no 
negotiable articles or papers. 

etectives believe that the attempt- 
ed robbery was the work . of experts, 
as fuses and nitroglycerin were in- 
serted according to the most accepted 
methods. The burglars entered the 
office through a rear gate to.the yard 
of the establishment and jimmied open 
a window to Bain udmittance to the 
building. 

This is the fourth time within the 
last few years that the DeJarnette 
company has heen operated upon. The 
office force was completely demoral- 
ized throughout the day, fearing the 
little puddle of explosive. liquid that 
collected on the floor. City Detectives 
Bullard and Carter and Captain M., 
J. Wright, finger print expert from 
headquarters, were assigned to the 
case.

Here’s the Kind 
Of News That Aids 
Business Improvement 
Forsyth, Ga. January 5.— 
(Special.)\—Thkere has-been a de- 
cided improvement in business 
conditions within the past several 
weeks’ according to statements is 
sued by Monroe county merchants. 
The retailers had a heavy De- 
cember trade: Although the cot- 
ton crop in Monroe was short, im- 
mense quantities of corn and other: 
feedstuffs were harvested, and, on 
the whole, this section enters the 
new year in far better shape than 
even the most optimistic authort- 
ties anticipated a few months ago. 
.There has not been a business 
failure in Monroe county among 
‘“ghe “.merchaiifs, either retail or 
}iwholesale,* it more than a year. 
and conditions on the farms are 
much, better than a year ago. 
‘Thousands of dollars worth of 
new machinery is being installed 
at the plant of the Forsyth mills, 
manufacturers of cotton yarns, 
skeins, cones and tubes. 
An addition has been built to 
the plant, ninety feet by eighty 
| .feet, and other improvements and. 
-enlargements have more thas 
‘doubled the plant’s capacity. 
The plant is now one of the 
‘largest and: most modern in cen- 
tral Georgia, and is operating full 
time. R. T. Persons, is president

4 ville, 


in connection with some colleges the 
alumni associations have and. main- 
tain organizations with a view of! 
proselyting among the prep schools, 
small colleges and high ‘schools, that 
they “aid” college boys who are able 
to play football or show other athletic 
promise, and that in some cases this 
aid extends to actual payment of 
these men, is true beyond doubt. 

I know one school where _ three 
prominent. citizens of the town, two 
of them ‘grads, the other a towny, 


have for years recruited, paid and 
“aided” athletes who will lrelp their 
teams, and who, being heavy gamblers, 
have more than repaid themselves the 
expenses by wagering on games. I] 
heard one of these men boast after 
this season that he had spent a large 
sum “helping” three of the players 
through college, and had won more 
than three times that much betting 
on the team. Nor was.he ashamed, 
nor did ‘he think he had done any- 
thing disgraceful. Rather he was 
beastful that he had done more than 
the coach to “make” the team, and 
proud of the fact he had debauched 
three youths and placed the school 
in danger Of disgrace: If the coach 
knew the fact (and I am certain he 
did not) he would have exposed the 
whole plot, and, in fact, did lay off 
one of the players.in midseason with- 
out explanation, which eaused me ta 
think he had heard rumors regarding 
his status and would not take a 
chance. 

It really makes Very little-difference 
about. college men: they @are old 
enough. to know better, or perhaps 
ruined merally before they descend Pa 
taking pay\for playing. 
THE CRYING 

EVIL. 

The great, erying evil of ‘this sys- 
tem of proxselyting or scouting ‘and 
offering bribes to get boys to attend 
certain schools, is in the effect upon 


joy and destroy all ideals, it is Aor 
a prep school boy, for instance, 
boast among his fellows that he hab 
seas an offer to attend some : cot 
ege 

“After all, true sport is built upon 
ideals. The boy who fights and weeps 
against being carried off the field js 
real; the cynical athlete who jogs 
off with a sigh of relief and an ex- 
pression of “Oh, well, .they can’t 
blame it on me,” is a cold douche 
to the entire student body. 

There is a prep school I know 
quite well. There is no school in the 
country that has a finer moralt, finer 
' fighting spirit, or is more loyal to 
its teams. Early last fall a scout 
for one of the big university teams 
approached this youngster, trying to 
pledge him to attend that college 
What inducements he offered or what 
authority he had to offer any 
never learned. It is probable, too, 
that the kid exaggerated what he was 
offered, and grew a bit boastful. 
THE 
EFFECT. 

The effect was: immediate: -team 
work fell off; the youngster became 
almost worthless to his team, insist- 
ed upon being starred, and broke up 
the morale. The story went the 
rounds of the school, exaggerated, of 
course, and it affected -the entire 
crowd of boys. Their faith in the 
ideals of sportsmanship was shat- 
tered, they grew suspicious, and lat- 
er in the season two of the young- 
stets were guilty of writing letters 
to a coach they knew with one of the 
bic schools, asking for an offer to 
play with the team at football, and 
che stated a sum for which he would 
be willing to attend the school, play 
football, baseball and run on_ the 
track’ team. The offer, of course, 


was ignored.

ATLANTA, GA. FRIDAY, JANUARY: 6, 1922.

: 


Chicago, January 6.—Wnlarged 
milling demand with unfavorable crop 
prospects had a bullish influence to- 
day on the wheat market. Prices 
closed firm, 1-8 to 1-2¢ net higher, 
with May $1.11 7-8 to $1.12, and July 
$1.01 1-4 to $1.01 3-8. Corn finished 
14 to 1-2c down; oats at 1-Be off 
to a like advance, and provisions un- 
ee to Te up. 

nnouncement that a Chicago mill 
had bought the entire stock or thaee 
dark northern spring wheat here had 
much to de with the final strength of 
the wheat market, although the 
amount of wheat involved in the 
transaction was relatively small, 4.,- 
000 bushels, The effect of the pur- 
chase, however, was enhanced by ear- 
lier reports of a more liberal call 
for wheat on the part of millers at 
St Louis, Kansas City and Minne- 
apolis. In addition, the fact was 
taken as significant that the Chi- 
cago purchase of dark northern was 
at/a big premium, 29 cepts a bushel 
higher than May delivery on ordinary 
pit contracts, Bulle put stress, 
100, on assertion that about w5 
per cent of the winter wheat 
acreage has a very low condition, and 
that vwather maps of the last three 
days ik®@ated no appreciable moisture 
relief it the worst of the dry area 
southwest. Nevertheless, buyers were 
cautious and even scattered selling 
found the market sometimes without 
support. 

Corn and oats averaged lower as a 
result seemingly of pressure from 
eash houses hedging against pur- 
chases of corn to arrive. 

Provisions were firmer in sympathy 
with hog values, and owing to small- 
ness of the December increase of 
western stocks of meats, the smallest 
in more than fourteen years.

\Chicago Bank typi OF 


Has Optimistic 
Outlook for 1922 


The National Bank of the Republic, 


of Chicago, Thursday issued the fol- 
lowing statement : x 

‘ “During the past year substantial 
foundations were laid for the optimism 
always current at this season, In this 
respect 1922 opens very differently 
from 1921. A year ago the forces 
of contraction were strongly in evi- 
dence—in commodity prices, in wages 
and employment, in industry generally. 

Since then prices in general have 
declined to the point where the subse- 
quent up-turn became inevitable, un- 
employment has passed its peak and 
is now receding slowly, while the 
various industries, with few excep- 
tions, have increased their activities 
very materially over the Jow point 
reached during the past _ fifteen 
months, 

“In a general way the first six 
months of 1921 may be characterized 
as a period of decline, and the last 
six months as one of improvement 
albeit that improvement has been of 
a halting nature due to yarious in- 
fluences, such as the threat of a rail- 
road strike, the cxpectations held out 
for the yevision of freight rates, the 
varying fortunes of the projected 
legislation anent taxes and the tariff 
and, finally, the fluctuating economic 
and political conditions abroad. 

Recovery Uneven. 

“Within the past six weeks there 
has been a very definite slackening 
of business, due partly to seasonal 
influences and partly to the desire 
of manufacturers and merchants to be 
as liquid of merchandise as possible 
over the inventory-taking period. But 
despite the temporary recession, busi- 
ness if unquestionably in larger 
volume today thar a year ago, al- 
though in what degree is obscured by} 
the various offsetting factors. 


_ “Thus vastly improved m&nufactur- 
ing operations in the east and middle 
west are counteracted in part by the 
generally slack activities in all 
branches of mining, Likewise im-: 
proved trade in the manufacturing 
sections has been offset by the greater 
disinclination to make purchases ob- 
served in agricultural regions and no- 
tably in the cotton belt, 


Credit Situation. 


“The unevenness is naturally due 
to the fact that all branches of in- 
dustry were not affected by depression 
at the sdme time, In a broad way 
those industries producing consumers’ 
goods, and which were the first to 
curtail, were the first to recover: 
while those producing raw materials, 
and which delayed curtailment until 
accumulated stocks made such action 
imperative, have necessarily Jagged be- 
hind in the process of recovery. 

"The liquidation of banking credits 
“frozen” by the precipitate decline in 
comstnodity prices has made very sub- 
stantial headway, the betterment in 
this respect being relatively greater 
in the commercial centers than in the 
interior agricultural regions.” |

COCA-COLA PLAN 
NEW BOSTON PLANT 


BY KR. L, BARNUM. 


New York, January 5.—It is re- 
ported here that the -Cola com- 
pany is contemplating the construc- 
tion of a new plant in Boston to man- 
ufacture the company’s product and 
at the same time it is said the strue- 
ture will be equipped for the purpose 
of refining sugar. 

Under the new plans the company 
wis buy the raw product and refine 
it in its own factory instead of de- 
pending upon refiners for its supply. 

This will no doubt prove profitable.

they had been ordered to retreat, 
while others were shouting that the

“Have you nay 
egainst Major Opie?” __. ea 

“None, whatever. I told no one to 
write you that I had been decorated. I 
was a volunteer.” 

Watson Objects. 

Senator Watson took sharp excep 
tionsto a line of cross-examination by 
John A. Cutchins, of Richmond, Va. 
eounsel for Major Opie. The lawyer 
had asked Smith if he believed a man 


killed in battle died an honorable 


death. 

“It’s outrageous to have officers bul- 
lying this poor, nervous man!” Senator 
Watson shouted. “We are after evi 
dence, not opinions.” 

After the flare-np, Chairman Bran- 
degee held, the question was not mete- 
rial, and it was withdrawn. 

Chairman Brandegee, calling atten- 
tion to discrepancies in statements in 


Smith’s letter and testimony. as to; 


the dugout shooting. asked which was 
correct, 

“What I right,” he 
said. 

He was then excused. 

Denies Seeing Shooting. 

Osborn Ellison, of Pulaski, mention- 
el by Smith as having been in the 
dugout with him at the time of the 
Woolwine shooting, declared be wae 
not present. 

“Did you 
Woolwine ?”’ 

“No, sir: J did not.” 

“Ever see Opie shoot any soldiers?” 
dier 7” 

“Never, 
never saw him but once.’ 

“That's all.” 

Lee Collins, of Dublin, Va., was next 


heard Smith’s testimony? 
Chairman Brandegee asked.

“Were you with him in the dug: ' 
out?” 

“NO, gir.” 

“Kver see Major Opie shoot Wool 
wine or anybody else*’ 

“No, sir.”’ 

Collins said he was a committee wit-: 
ness, and not summoned by Major 
Opie. 

Not in Dugout. 

William J. Eskew, of Pulaski, Va 
ef the 116th infantry, testified that he 
was not in the dugout where Smith 
said Woolwine was shot. He had been 
named by Smith as having been pres- 
ent. 

“Did you ever see Major Opie shoot 
a soldier ?’’ 

“No, ° sir.” 

“You can go.” 

Edwin Duner, of San Francisco, a 
voluntary witness, stepped forward and 
declared he wanted to testify concern- 
ing prison atrocities in France. 

“Il was at Bassens prison, near 
Bordeaux, where I was sent up for 
three months for going across the 
street—out of my area—to get two 
egg sandwiches.” While at the pris- 
on, Duner said he saw a _ sergeant 
while drunk kill a prisoner for ask- 
ing for a slice of bread. ‘The ser- 
geant, he added, was not court-mar- 
tialed so far as he knew. 


Sergeant Named Cooper. 


John Fitzgerald, of Pennsylvania, 
who was locked up for being drunk, 


enemy was approaching, A tense sit- 
uation, developing suddenly, found | 
him alone in the effort to reform the 
lines, At the moment he was with- 
out sidearms, was wearing a raincoat. 
the insignia of which was covered 
with mud, and it was with difficulty 
that he could make the men halt. 

“T took a rifle and fired twice,” 
he said, “knowing perfectly well what 
I was doing. One shot was fired in 
the air and one on the ground, No- 
body was hit. After I fired. the ‘lines 


stopped and I got them in shape, put- 


ting men J recogmzed in command. I] €

sent runners to bring all the men up. 
There was not a dead soldier on the 
ine and there bad_been no firing.” 

‘Nid you shoot a runner with a 
revolver, as charged?” the chairman 
asked, 

Never Fired Pistol. 

“Tl never fired a pistol the whole 
time I was in the army,” Major Opie 
declared, with emphasis. 

Chairman Brandegee wanted to 
know if Major Opie had any theory 
as to how the repor’s about him had 
starred, 

“None. sir.” he said. “It may be 
that one circumstance led to it. I 
dislike to mention names, but it might 
be the only thing to do in justice to 
others. It happened that Lieutenant 
Flovd W. Cunningham accidently 
killed himself with a rifle, and I was 
I bent down, 
opened his blouse. and while there 
alone in that position some stragglers 
may have been round. I sometimes 
think this scene may have started 
rumors of which I was the victim.” 

“Deliberately Untrue.” 

Senator Willis, republican. Ohio, 
questioned Major Opie regarding the 
testimony of Henry L. Scott, of Ken- 
more, Ohio, that he saw the major 
shoot a runner. “It is deliberately 
untrue,” he exclaimed. 

Senator Willis said he merely de- 
sired to get the major’s denial in the 
record. 

The examination of Maior Opie was 
brief, Senator Watson taking no part 
in it, 

Major Opie said he had been award- 
ed the distinguished service cross, the 
legion of honor, and croix de guerre 
with two palms. 

Called to testify as to charges that 
Major Onie had shot two soldiers in 
France, Horace Cooke, of Covington, 
Va., declared today thrt all he kne 
about the case was hearsay. 

Knows “Nothing.” 

Claude Breendon, of Covington, a 
former servicé man, also was called. 

“What do you know about. the 
charges against Major Opie?’ Chair- 
man Brandegee asked. 

“Nothing.” 

“You are excused.” 

The names of Breedon and Cooke. 
who served in Major Opie’s command 
-~third battalion, 116th infantry— 
overseas,. were mentioned in a letter 
to Senator Watson as likely to have 
evidence, but they insisted they knew 
nothing of their own knowledge. 

‘irginian Testifies. 

A moment later, however, Leméel 
O. Smith, of Dublin, Va., who has been 
in an institution for the insane since 
the war, declared '¢ saw Major Opie 
shoot a soldier. 

“While in a dugout with three com- 
rades and four Gerinan prisoners,” 
said Smith,°“I saw Major Opie take 
a gun and deliberately shoot a man. The 
man Opie shot was William Wool- 
wine. He was shot in the dugout, 
about in the middle of it. Opie was 
ten steps from Woolwine.” 

“What did Major Opie say?’ he 
was asked. 

“He said: ‘] shot him; take him 


“What was said before the sboot- 
ng?” 

“Not a word was passed. Major 
Opie gave no reason.” 

“How many shots were fired?” 

"One. It hit Woolwine in the chest. 
He was dead when we picked him 
up.” 

“Did you make a complaint about 
the shoofing?”’ 

“I did not.” 

Contradicts Letter. 

In a letter to Senator Watson Smith 
said he bad been decorated by the 
French and American governments, 
but he admitted that he had received 
no such honors, 

“Why dd you say it then?’ 


“A friepd of mine, a patient in the) 


hospital a Marion with me. wrote the 
letter, and I signed it without read. 
ing it.” 

“Who wrote the let 


was named by Duner as the prisoner 
killed. The sergeant, he said, was 
named Cooper. 

Duner also gave the names of wit- 
nesses, saying 150 negroes and 200 
white men were present. “We were 
going to mob Re sergeant, but there 
were too many automatics,’’ he con- 
tinued. “Later the colonel, a big 
Polock, came up in his limousine and 
asked if anybody there saw the shoot- 
ing. Seven of us stepped forward 
and they put us right away in solitary 
on bread and water.” 

“They had a lieutenant, a regular 
“He 
used to come back from Italy, where 
he went for his dope, and then he 
would stand up and say, ‘Boys, I am 
glad to see you.’ I guess be was, for 
he got us out at midnight for inspec- 
tion.” 

“IT am Edward Duner, known also 
as Hobo Kelby, 
he declared aitery the hearing, as a 
bunch of motion picture operators 
seized him by the arm and dragged 
him toward the light. 


Known as “Hobo Kelly.” 


Recalled at the afternoon session, ' 


Duner said he was known before the 
war as “Hobo Kelly, the tramp.” 

“How did you get here—blind bag- 
gage?’ asked Senator Overman. 

“No, sir: L paid my way. I never 
rode the blind baggage in my life. l'm 
a hunter and trapper, but I’ve been 
over the world.” 

Concerning recent testimony to the 
effect that a soldier named Bennie 
I’. King, of Wilmington, N. C., had 
been hanged, war department records 
were presented by Colonel Bethel 
showing that King was killed in action 
September 20, 1918. 

Charles I’. Cox, of Lynchburg, Va., 
first of the witnesses for Major Opie 
to be called, testified that he never 
heard of the alleged shooting of .a 
soldier by the officer. 

“IT was continually with Major 
Opie until he was wounded,” said Cox, 
“and I never once heard a rumor that 
he had been accused of killing any- 
body.” 

(Cox declared he had come as a vol- 
untary witness and was not asked to 
appear. The first he heard of the 
shooting report, he said, was publica- 
tion of charges since the senate hear- 
ing started. 

Fired While in Lines. 

Howard Fifer, of Staunton, Va., 
said he was with Major Opie on Oc- 
tober 8 and 9, 1918, on the days he 
was accused of shooting his men. 

“Did you see Major OUpie fire a 
rifle in reforming his lines?’ the of- 
ficer’s counsel asked. 

“Yes, Stragglers were coming in, 
and Major Opie ordered them to 
halt. As some were going forward, 
Major Opie took a rifle and fired 
two or three times into the hillside to 
get the attention of the stragglers 
and to stop them. No one was shot 
and I came here to swear to that.” 

“Did Major Opie fire into the di- 
rection of the stragglers?’ Chairman 
Brandegee asked. 

“No, sir. He fired in the other di- 
rections, He shot toward no shell 
hole. ; 

“Major Opie was trying to get the 
men to halt. He fired twelve feet 
ahead of them.” 

“Did vou hefr later that some- 
body was shot?” , 

“No, sir.’ 

Figer said he did not hear any re- 
port About the major shooting a run- 
ner. 

Says He Saw Hangings. : 

Herbert L. Cadenhead, of Greenvill, 
Miss., 21 years old, a former service 
man, said he saw “ten or twelye’’ men 
executed at Is-Sur-Tille. War depart 
ment records previously submitted to 
the committee showed that two gol- 
diers were hanged at Is-Sur-Tille and 
that eleven soldiers were hanged in 
France after conviction by genera) 
court-martial. 

“How many hangings did you see 
altogether?” Chairman Brandegee 
asked, 

‘Ten or twelve,” he replied. 

The witness did not know how many 
had been tried. Some of the men 
hanged, he said, made statements on 
the gallows. . 

One of those put to death was a 
lieutenant, charged with assaulting a 
7-year-old girl, he declared. The wit- 
ness went over the’ executions he 
claimed to have seen, yne by one. 

Cadenhead produced several small 
photographs of purported hanging 


seenes.

Pressed by Chairman Brandegee, 
Cadenhead said all the executions be 
saw were around Is-Sur-Tille. 

At this point, Colonel Walter A, 

Bethel, who was General Pershing’s 
judge advocate general in France, 
stated that of the eleven executions 
listed by the war department one teok 
place in December, 1917, three in 
1918 and the others in 1919, after 
the armistice. 
_ Cadenhead declared he bad no feel- 
ing dgainst officers and that he vol- 
untarily offered to come forward aft- 
er seeing the statement printed that 
there were only two hangings at Is- 
Sur-Tille. 

“I had seen more than that.” he 
said, “and it seemed to me that some 
officers were guilty.” 3 

Senator Brandegee asked .if Ca- 
denhead eould produce witnesses to 
support hig statement. He mention- 
ed “Andrew Saloon,” but explained 
that the spelling was “Chelume” and 
that he lived .at Elmhurst, L. I.

DENIES KNOWLEDGE. 

Knoxville, Tenn., 
Robert Barksdale, formerly of the 
litth infantry, whose name was 
brought before the senate committee 


witnessed the alleged shooting of a 
runner by Major H. L. Opie, teday 
entered positive denial of knowledge of 
any such event, 

Barksdale’s name was mentioned as 
a supporting witness by William F. 


mittee Wednesday that Major Upie 
had shot a runner because the man 
failed to obey a command to halt. 

In a statement today Barksdale, 
who was a corporal and acting ser- 
geant with the intelligence section of 
Major Opie’s battalion to which se- 
tion the runners were attached, de- 
nied positively having witnessed any 
such event. 

He said there were stories of men 
being shot under various conditions, 
but he said the excitement at the 
front was so great and so many wiid 
stories were circulated that he never 
placed any credence in any of the 
tales. Barksdale said Major Opie 
had the reputation of being a strict 
disciplinarian, but he characterized 
the major as the “bravest man” he 
saw in the army. 


COLLECTOR ROSE 
MAKES STATEMENT 
ON INCOME TAXES 


A statement given out by Collector 
Josiah ‘I’. Kose, of the internal reve- 
nue department in the federal build- 
ing, explains the provisions of the 
revenue act of 1921, which became ef- 
fective Janyary 1, 1922, respecting 
personal exemptions allowed married 
persons and the return required on 
gross incomes of $5,000 or more. 

The statement is as follows: 

The revenue act of 1921 contains two 
new and important provisiens, which are 
ihe subject of frequent inquiry, The firet 
relates to the persenal exemptions allowed 
inarrie@ persons, and the second to the 
provision requiring that a return be made 
ef gross incomes of 3&5, or more. 

he act provides that a married person, 
living with husband or wife, whose net in- 
come for 1921 was $5,000 or less, ghall be 
allowed @ personal exemption of $2,500. 
if the net income of such person was over 
$5,000 the exemption is $2,000. Under the 
revenue act of 1918 the personal exemption 
ullowed a married person was 82,000, re- 
gardliess of the amount of net income. 
The normal tax rate remains unchanged, 
4 per cent on the first $4,000 of pet in- 
come ahove the exemptions and 8 per cent 
on the remaining vet income, 

In order that an income slightly in ex- 
cess of $5,000 shall not be subjected to an 
inordinately disproportionate tax because of 
the reduction of the exemption to $2,000 
thereon, the law provides that such reduc- 
{tion shall not operate to increase the tax, 
which would be payable if the exemption 
was $2,500 by more than the amount of 
the net income in excess of $5,000, 

For example, op a net income of $5,010. 
the tax, without this, saving clause, would 
be $110.40, which is 4 per cent on $3,0)0, 
ihe ainevuat of net income less an exemption 
of .$2,000, The actual tax is $110.40, com- 
puted as follows: From the net iscome of 
$5,010, ts deducted $2,500, leaving $2,510, 
the 4 per cent tux on which amotnts to 
$100.40. To this is added $10, ‘‘the amount 
of net incume in excess of $5,000," 

The personal exemptions allowed married 
persons, apply also to the head of a fam- 
ily. @ person who gupports in one honge- 
hold one or more relatives by blood, mar- 
riage or adoption. 
’ Heretofore, a person whose net income 
was less than his exemption ($1,000 ir 
single, or $2,000 if married) was not fe- 
quired to file a returp, Under the revenue 
act of 1921, if the gross income of an 
inidividuat equatied or exceeded $5,000, or 
if the combined gross income of a married 
conple and that 
dren equalled or exceeded 5.000, a return 
must be filed, regardies§ of the amount 
of net income. 

‘‘Net income’’ is gross income, less cer- 
tain deductions. The fact thet allowable 
deductions from fross income, for business 
expenses, losses, bad debts, etc., may Fe- 
duce the net income to an amount below 
the personal exemptions of $1,000 or $2,000, 
does not alter the requirement to file a re- 
turn of gross income. if such gross income 
equaled or exceeded $5,000, 


ANOTHER CARLOAD 
OF HOGS SOLD 
IN SUMTER COUNTY 


Americus, Ga., January 5.—(Spe- 
cial.)—Two cars of Sumter county 
hogs containing 256, head and includ. 
ing a number of young pigs today 
were sold through George QO. Marshall, 
county farm demonstration agent, 
brought’ Sumter farmers the round 
sum of $],993.47. In the two cars 
there were about forty young shotes 
sold by farmers. These were all sold 
by the head and brought prices aver- 
aging 10 cents a pound, while the 
average price for the two cars was 
6 1-2 cents, or half a cent above the 
prevailing Moultrie delivered quota- 
tion. The price paid was f. o. b, 
Americus, the hogs being purchased 
by Carolina butchers, who sent egents 
bere. 


FORT FIGHTS 
FOR REDUCED 
INSURANCE RATES 


Americus, Ga., January 5.—(Spe- 
cial.)\—Major James A. Fort, in a 
formal communication to the city 
conncil of Americus, has started a 
fight on existing fire insurance rates 
in Americus. According to Mr. Fort, 
the difference in rates between Amer- 
| icus and Atlanta is $5.20 per $1,000, 
the basic rate here being $8.70 as com- 
pared with $3.50 in Atlanta, 

This makes a difference of $104 in 
the cost of a $5,000 policy for five 
years in Americus and Atlanta, the 
difference being in favor of the latter 
city. 

Mr. Fort claims that Americus in 
proportion to the fire risks here, has 
a fire department equally well 
equipped and maintained as that of 
Atlanta. and that in correspondence 
with Joseph S. Raine. secretary of 
the Southeastern Underwriters’ asso- 
ciation, he has received only perfunc- 
tory replies to the effect that any 
reduction in rates here would not be 
justifies at this time. : 

Because of Mr. Fort’s prominence 
as state commander of the Georgia 
American Legion, his charges of un-

Movies to. Keep 
Boys on theFarm 


—a 


John Armstrong Chaloner, of 
“Who's Looney Now” fame, native of 
Virginia, and well known tourist end 
philanthropist, arrived in Atlanta 
‘Thursday from South Carolina for a 
three-day stay. His present campaign, 
which is slated to cover the 48 states 
of the union, is to selve the question 
“Hew you goner ‘em n on 
the farm, after they’ye seen Paree?’ 
Lie solyed the question, be says, in 
Virginia and the Carolinas, by estab- | 
lishing moving picture houses in the 
farm sections of those states. 

Mr. Chaloner years ago became na- | 
tionally known when he was legally 
declared sane jim Virginia and insane 
in New York. He later fought the 
matter out in New York eourts and 
was declared sane there. 

Mr. Chaloner thinks hig proposi- 
tion to be one of national importance, 
in view of the fact that thousands of 
discontented country people are mov- 
ing to the cities to see the sights. He 
wants movies established in rural 
centers, the cost te be cared for by 
admission fees, but should they be in- 
sufficient, the deficit to be met by 
state appropriation. He says that | 
return to Georgia 
later. 

Mr. Chaloner tried out the scheme 
ou his estate near Cobham, Va,, and 
it proved an overwhelming success, | 
be claime. He says that North Caro- 
lina has a iated $50,000 to be 
used in cing movie machines 
certain localities and, that 20 counties 
are to try the experiment. 

Mr. Chaloner deeded recently $10.- 
000 -to S0¥th Carolina colleges and 
says that the greater part of his) 
estate will go to the universities of 
North Carolina and Virgi. | 


Lure of Movi. 
May Explain 
Sexton Mystery 


Claims Chaloner 


Macon, Ga., January 5.—(Special.) 
{s the mysterious disappearance. of 
A. P. Sexton, prominent Koyston 
pianter, the culmination of an oft- 
expressed desire to enter the “*mov- 
ies ?” 

Information to the effect that he 
had expressed such a desire and 
that he had written a close friend at 
Valdosta that he expected to take 
a trip west shortly, was placed in the 
hands of Macon city detectives io-| 
day and it is the beliet of some of 
Sexton’s friends that his disappear- 
ance can be explained in this way. 
His friends and associates at Valdos- 
wa are said to have beard him on 
more than one occasion express the 
belief that he would be successful as 
an actor, 

He wus a man of striking appear- 
ance and had many of the quaiifica- 
tions that would go toward making} 
a successful actor. 

Blood elots which were found on the 
Wheeler road yesterday and 
were analyzed at the Maeon 
were not caused by blood 
from a human body. It developed 
that the blood was from two hogs' 
which were kitled on the road by Lee 
Phillips, of Cross Keys. The hogs 
escaped while on their way to the 
butcher and Phillips killed them when | 
be had difficulty in recapturing them. 

The reward of $200 previously an- |! 
nounced for the finding of Sexton's 
body, was today increased to $500. 

A careful check of the missing 
man’s accounts is said to have revealed 
the fact that he eould tlot have bad 
more than $200 with him at tbe time 
of his disappearance. 

Sexton’s atuomobile was found on 
the Spring street bridge last Satur- 
day, after the city detectives bad re- 
ceived a letter stating that Sexton 
had been robbed and his body thrown 
in the swamp. The letter was signed 
“The Thief.”

his own wife, Ernest T. Phillips, of 
LAbeeG county, was arraigned in 
court here today and his case contin-4 
ued because the chief witness, Eu- 
gene Crawley, uncle of the girl-bride

Lied Vaideailte. 


(At the Grand.) 

Another entertaining program is 
offered for the last half of the week 
at Loew’s Grand theater. Not only 
is the vaudeville of a variety and 
class that wins applause, but the 
screen program is far above the 
ordinary, with Dorothy Dalton 
Playing a role in “The Ten of Dia- 
monds” that is ome of the best she 
has ever offered. 

Bernice LaBarr and her Beaus 
are awarded the headline honors. 
The agt has class and introduces a 
charming personality in Miss La- 
Barr and a good male quartet in 
her four beaus. Several popular 
song numbers, some pretty dancing, 
a lot of clean comedy and a pretty 
Stage setting combine to put over 
the offering with pronounced suc- 
cess. 

Other acts that score are Muriel 
Hudson and Dave Jones in hits 
from ssical comedy shows, Mar- 
lin a Courtney in sparkling bits 
of travesty, King and Rose in char- 
acter song impressions, and the 
King Brothers, athletes. The lat- 
ter exhibit some remarkable feats 
of strength, their balancing, tum- 
bling and acrobatic work making 2 
big hit with the crowd in attend- 
ance Thursday night. 


“The Conquering Power.” | 


(At the Heward.) 

Painstaking: attention to the in- 
numerabie details which play so im- 
portant a part in creating the 
proper atmosphere, marked _ the 
filming of the Rex Ingram produc- 
tion for Metro, “The Conquering 
Power,” adapted from the famous | 
Balzac story, “Eugene Grandet,” 
which is playing a successful run 
at the Howard theater this week. 

The youthful director who won 
world-wide fame by his wonderful- 
lv dramatic picturization of “The 
Four Horsemen of-the Apocalypse,” 
from the novel of Vicente Blasco 
Ibanez, followed out the same ar- 
tistic prineiples in transferring the 
celebrated story of Balzac to the 
screen. That he fully succeeded 
was the unenimous verdict of the 
crities when “the Conquering Pow- 
er’ was given its first showing in 
New York. Rudolph, who will be 
long rememberes as the sheik, is 
the hero of the story. The overture 
is “La Boheme” and is received with 
much enthusiasm.

~ IN BARBER SHOP 


Woods Rawlins Ends Life 
With Revolver Which 
Was Laid Upon Shelf 
by Customer. 


Before any move could be made to 
prevent him from taking his life, 
Woods Rawlins, aged 34, a barber, re- 
siding at 10 South Delta avenue, sent 
a bullet through his heart in the shop 
where he is employed at 6 Decatur 
street, shortly before noon Thursday. 
Death was almost instantaneous. 

The pistol with which Kawtlins end- 
ed his life was the property of EK. G. 
Glenn, a syi§cial officer of the South- 
ern railroad, and had been laid on a 
nearby shelf a few minutes before 
while its owner was getting a shave. 

Despondency over his wife's contin- 
ued illness is said to have been the 
cause for the suicide. N. T. Ray, 
the proprietor of the barber shop, 
stated that Rawlins had appeared to 
be in poor spirits for the past few 
weeks. 

According to the story given by eye- 
witnesses, Kawlins picked up the de- 
tective’s gun, examined it, and put it 
down. He acted deliberately and 
seemed to be examining the mechanism 
of the weapon. A minute later he 
picked up the gun for a second time, 
and pointing it toward his heart, 
fired the shot. 

The body was sent to the chapel of 
Awtry & Lowndes, pending funeral 
arrangements.

Thursday night by J. J. Brown, com- 
missioner of agriculture. 

The meeting was purely a social af- 
fair, the outgrowth of a promise to 
entertain them made by Commissioner 
Brown to capitol reporters of tlie 
three Atlanta newspapers about three 
years ago. Devereaux F. McClatchey, 
acted as toastmaster. 

Present were Paul Stevenson, Fuz- 
zy Woodruff and Loyd Wilhoit, of 
The Constitution; Ralph Smith, Ed 
Bradley and Rogers Winter, of The 
Journal, and Victor Barron, Dudley 
Glass and John Mar&h, of The Geor-

-Tongue-tied Business 


It often occurs that a man reaches out after a higher class 
of business which he does not get—and wonders why. 

To the advertising expert the reason is very simple; this 
man“is not talking to his prospective customers in an appeal- 
ing manner; what he says does not Carry enough force with it. 
Perhaps he is using “shoddy” looking stationery which is 
not engraved in a manner that will attract the public.

tion with headquarters in At!anta, the 
conference of representatives of wel- 
fare departments of five * southern 
states adjourned Thursday night fol- 
lowing its final session at the Wine- 
coff hotel. The passage of the resolu- 
tion was the feature of the work done 
Thursday, and its adoption drew forth 
a strong counter denunciation of the 
work of the welfare workers from Rev. 
Crawford Jackson, Atlanta, secretary 
of the Southern Juvenile Protective 
association. , 

In the resolution adopted the state 
welfare workers charge that Rey. 
Jackson’s organization “has for a 
number of years interfered with the 
progress of juvenile court work in the 
south.” It is declared that there is 
little value in the work of the Jackson 
organization, and a eall is made on 
churches and other bodies to decline 
to permit Secretary Jackson to make 
collections or deliver speecties in their 
buildings. 

Denounces Charge. 

Replying to the charges of the wel- 
fare workers Secretary Jackson de- 
nounces the charges, and said he had 
expected something like them for some 
time. He said the executive commit- 
tee of his organization met recently 
and after receiving his report unani- 
mously indorsed his work. 

Burr Blackburn, secretary of the 
Georgia state board of public welfare, 
who invited the welfare workers to 
Atlanta, stated Thursday night that 
he had no reply to make to Jackson. 

“We don’t want to be drawn into 
any newspaper controversy over the 
question,” he said. “The resolution 
was adopted by representatives of the 
official wélfare departments of five 
southern states, and stands for itself.” 

In the resolutions it was charged 
that Secretary Jackson's activities 
serve ‘to discredit. practical juvenile 
court work in southern states. It is 
charged that he “winters in Florida 
and summers in North Carolina,’ .and 
that he spends his time “writing senti- 
mental poetry and traveling through

taking up collections.” 

Appeal to Patrons. 

The welfare workers called on all 
“national figures” connected with it 
to withdraw permission from Jaékson 
to use their names on letterheads. The 
welfare workers also called on church- 
es of the south “to refuse access to 
their pupils” to Jackson. 

In his reply Secretary Jackson said 
the charge was true that he went to 
Florida in the winter and to North 
Carolina in the summer. He said the 
executive committee of his organiza- 
tion is composed of General Clifford 
I,, Anderson, Henry C. Bagley, Dr. 8. 
R. Belk, James L. Anderson and Dr. 
A. L. Holderby, and that these officers

the secretary. He said letters were

of Secretary Jackson was*indorsed.

Take a Glass of Salts to Flush 
Kidneys If Bladder Bothers 
You—Drink Lots of Water. 


Eating meat regularly eventually

or other, says a well-known author- 
ity, because the urie acid in meat 
excites the kidneys, they become over- 
worked; get sluggish; clog up and 
cause all sorts of distress, particu- 
larly backache and misery in the kid- 
ney region; rheumatic twinges, se- 
vere headaches, acid stomach, ‘consti- 
pation, torpid liver, sleeplessness, 
bladder and urinary irritation. 

The moment your back hurts or 
kidneys aren’t acting right, or if blad- 
der bothers you, get about four ounces 
of Jad Salts from. any good phar- 
macy; take a tablespoonful in a glass 
of water before breakfast for a few 
days and your kidneys will then act 
fine. This famous salts is made from 
the acid of grapes and lemon jvice, 
combined with lithia, and has been 
used for generations to flush clog- 
ged kidneys and stimulate them to 
normal activity; also to neutralize 
the acids in the urine so it no longer 
irritates, thus ending bladder dis- 
orders. 

Jad Salts cannot injure anyone; 
makes a delightful effervescent lithia-

the 
relected for 1922—Dr. R. ‘I. Dorsey, 
president; Dr. H. KR. Donaldson, vice 


Twenty-eight members of the Ful- 
ton County Medical society were pre- 
sented with certificates of distinction 
Thursday night by Dr. Garnett W. 
Quillian, president, at the annual ban- 
quet of the society in the Capital 
City club. ‘The certificates, which 
were awarded to all who bave been 
active members for twenty-five years, 
were given to the following doctors: 

Cc. E. Murphy, W. P. Nicholson, 
G. H. Noble, Dunbar Hoy, L. P. Ste- 
phens, J. E. Sommerfield, A, W. 
Stirling, W. F. Westmoreland, J. P. 
cennedy, W. E. Campbell, J. RK. 
Campbell, M. G. Campbell, Arch Av- 
ary, J. C. Avary, W. T. Brown, W.’ 
L. Champion, L. BK. Clarke, W. A. 
Crowe, E. C. Davis, J. G. Earnest, 
W. 8. Elkin, C. G. Giddings, W. 8. 
Goldsmith, *T. H. Hancock, M. B. 
Hutchins, J. C. Johnson, J. B. Baird 


and B. E. Pearce. 


Other features of the meeting were 
installation of officers recently 


president, and Dr. Grady Glay, secre- 
tary and treasurer—the inaugural ad- 
dress of Dr. Dorsey and an address 
by Dr. James S. McLester, of Bir- 
mingham, Ala., on “Clinical Estima- 
tion of; Renal Efficiency.” 

Dr. Dorsey’s Address. 

In Dr. Dorsey's address he warm- 
ly indorsed the plan to construct a 
medical home and library for the so- 
ciety. He said that with $20,000, 
definite action on building the home 
could be taken, and after announcing 
a number of subscriptions for its 
ereetion, he called for a general sub- 
scription from the doctors at the ban- 
quet. As a result of’ his appeal ap- 
proximately $5,000 was promised. 

Dr. Dorsey, in his address, also pro- 


posed a number of changes in the pol-. 


icy and conduct of the society. 

He recommended that the present 
order of business allocating five min- 
utes for clinical talks and the report 
of cases be increased toe ten minutes. 

That the duties of assistant secre- 
tary be augmented und tkat he be dele- 
gated as acting sergeant at arms. 

That preperly prepared and con- 
ducted clinics should be attended reg- 
ularly by the members of the society. 
for which purpose a committee of 
three should be appointed—one by 
the medical staff of the white Grady 
section, another by the negro section, 
and one not connected with either sec- 
tion to,be appointed by the society; 
that the clinies be held in the amphi- 
theater of the Grady hospital and that 


they be held once or twice a month. 
. Hall Is Offered Free. 

That the suciety accept the invita- 
tion ef Dr. Luther Fischer by which 
the society can use free of ali carge 
for meetings the assembly hail of the 
new annex to the Davis-fischer sani- 
tarium. 

That to better serve the cause of 
medicine and the commonwealth the 
society should put on a continuous 
drive to get doctors to register, vote 
and to exercise their guvod influences 
in civic, state and national politics. 

And that our time, energy and 
money should be devoted solely to con- 
structive legislation and educational 
propaganda. 

Dr. Quillian, who presented the cer- 
tificates of distinction, besides deliv- 
ering an eulogy on the character and 
ability of the 28 distinguished doctors. 
also gave an outline of the history of 
the society. 

“Tt was in the latter part of July 
or the first part of August, 1882.” 
he said, “that eight physicians gath- 
ered in the office of Dr. J. C. Avary 
and organized the Aflanta Society of 
Medicine, as it was first called. 

“The eight charter members of this 
organization were Drs. Lancaster, 
Tom Raine. A. S. Dyer, J. R. Hodge- 
hill, J. D. Wilson, J. C. Avary, James 
W. Byers and Willis Parks. 

Invited Experts. 

“These men, showing the spirit of 
the organization, chose as their mot- 
to this expression: ‘Seeking knowl- 
edge, not ready to spread knowledge,” 
and they invited men like saitned Dr, 
Todd, Drs. Baird and Nicolson to 
attend their meetings and deliver to 
them lectures. 

“The first president of this society 
was Dr. J. D. Wilson, now 
his reward, and its first secretary was 
Dr. J. C. Avary, the only surviving 
charter member and who honors us 
with his presence here tonight, and 
in this connection, Mr. Chairman, I 
wish to say that this society has never 
had two more loyal nor more faith- 
ful, nor devoted members than the 
Avarys, and when the final history of 
this society is written due credit and 


all praise will be given to Drs. J. C. | 


and Arch Avary. 


“At a later time the name of this | 
‘The | 
Atlanta Society of Medicine’ to “The | 


organization was changed from 


Atlanta Academy of Medicine.’ and 


more recently, to harmonize with the, 


requirements of the American Medical 


association, the name of ‘The Fulton | 
County Medical society’ was adopted.”
