U.S. m oves pondered as ships patrol 

WASHINGTON (A P ) - T ho nu- clear-powerod aircraft ca rrier E n te r­ prise cruised off East Africa on Friday as U.S. military officials kept watch on the situation in U ganda w here P r e ­ sident Idi Amin has ordered all A m er­ icans detained until Monday. 
Pentagon officials said no orders had been issued for any m ilitary moves. 
But it was believed that staff officers were considering various possible op­ tions in case U.S. citizens in Uganda require rescue. 
Amin ordered the som e 24o A m er­ icans in U g an d a not to leav e th e country and to meet with him Monday. 
He said President Carter should con­ sider U.S. human rights issues before commenting on Ugandan affairs. 
Disgusted 

C arter e a rlie r this week said the 
Ugandan g o v ern m e n t’s h an d lin g of human rights had "disgusted the en ­ tire civilized world.” 
A Ugandan government spokesm an said there was no reason for A m e r­ icans to he alarm ed over Amin s ac­ tions and that they would be free to leave after the Monday meeting. 
Asked about the Ugandan situation 
Friday night. Carter replied, without elaboration: "I think it s going to be all right.” 
Radio Kampala on Friday broadcast a m essage saying the m eeting with 
Americ • r in Uganda is for Amin to 
“ thank iii Americans for the excellent work they have been doing in Uganda 

The broadcast said that Am ericans who want U gandan citizenship will have it granted as well as those who want their work perm its extended. 
It added that special'honors are be­ ing considered for those who have done special work and “ after the meeting, it is likely his excellency the president w ill throw a big reception to them with cultural shows and dances performed by the heartbeat of Africa." 
White 
House spokesman 
Jody 
Powell, informed of the broadcast, said. “ We do consider this broadcast helpful in allaying concerns.” 
Meanwhile, there were indications the Carter administration intends to be very cautious about making even p u r­ ely p re c a u tio n a ry m ilita ry m o v e s because Amin s possible reaction is unpredictable. 
Sources said the diplomatic avenue is boing counted on to assure the safety of the Americans in Uganda 
S tate 
D e p a rtm e n t s p o k e s m a n 
Frederick Z. Brown said that Assistant 
Secretary of State for African affairs 
William E. Schuufele su m m o n ed a 
Ugandan diplomat to the departm ent 
Friday to express strong concern about 
Amin's order. 

Powell declined to comment Friday when asked if U.S. m ilitary planes were being readied for a possible evacuation of A m ericans from the landlocked East African country. 
He said it was safe to assum e the 

President would take w hatever steps are necessary and proper to assure the 
Americans’ safety. 
Powell later said the U.S. Navy task force operating near the east coast of 
Africa was on “ routine, publicly a n ­ nounced maneuvers. ” 
Powell said the force, consisting of the Enterprise, cruisers Truxton and 
Long Beach and the su b m arin e Tau- tog, left Mombasa, Kenya, on Monday, 
However, both the Pentagon and the 
U.S. embassy in Nairobi said the ships h ad d ep a rte d on W ed n esd ay . 
Powell called a special news briefing to deny ru m o rssth at 5,-ooo M arines were poised to invade Uganda. He said the task force has fewer than 2oo Ma­ rines aboard. 

Lackland incident probed 

Lackland AFB officials began an investigation Friday of alleged training violations by a training instructor. 

A Lackland spokesman said the 
I incident allegedly took place dur­ ing an inspection of basic trainees 
Friday morning. 

The allegations were made by two trainees who were under the instructor's supervision. 

The spokesman would not com­ ment on the nature of the allega­ tions or give the names of the parties involved.

UTSA m ight lose 4 o profs 

By DAVID HENDRICKS 
The University of Texas at San 
Antonio could lose 4o or more teachers from its 3oo-member faculty if the Texas Legislature cuts the college’s budget as ex­ pected, the university’s presi­ dent warned Friday. 
Teachers who may not have their contracts renewed next Septem ber are those now teaching fin a tem porary, part-time or visiting professor status. said university president Dr. P e te r 
Flawn. 
“ We are trying to give as early no­ tice as we can that we may not be able to renew their co n tra ils,” Dr. Flawn said. 
Final decision 

The u n iv e rsity should be able to make a final decision in April, when the le g isla tu re’s allocation to UTSA will become evident, he added. 
The effect on the university is that surviving faculty m em bers will have heavier class loads, especially with an expected UMM) to 1.2oo student increase next year, the president said

 hit worse than others, depending on anticipated student enrollm ents, Dr. 
Flawn said 
F o r in sta n c e , he said the S ocial 
Sciences Department will have more faculty positions open because of high student demand. 
However, other d ep a rtm e n ts, like 
English, may lose some of their part­ tim e or v is itin g p ro fe s s o r fa c u lty m em bers, Dr. Flawn said. 
The fewer teachers and higher stu ­ dent n u m b e rs co u ld r a is e the teacher-student ratio to as high as 27 to 
I. one of the highest in the state, he said. 

No light loads 

Noting that Gov. Dolph Briscoe has alleged that college faculty m em bers often have light work loads, Dr. Flawn said the criticism does not apply to 
UTSA. 
Since UTSA is new and grow ing, many faculty m em bers arc burdened with program developm ent responsi­ bilities, Dr Flavin said 
Ile added that he hoped a higher state allocation than what is now su ­ spected is granted by legislators. 

Man puts bite on law 

A nu.n arrested by police for being drunk wants his teeth back. 
Police didn’t punch them out. They fell out . . . of his pocket. 
The man filed a claim with City

T h ey w h is p e r into tho e a r s of th e m ighty, influence policy, a rr a n g e fa­ vors for clients but never an sw er to the public. 
They hold no official status, yet they have pipelines into the highest offices in the land. 
One m om ent, they m ay be operating as fixers without portfolio in behalf of high-paying clients. 
T h e n e x t, th e y m a y he h a n d li n g so m e W hite H ouse a s s ig n e m e n t too delicate to be perform ed by anyone in official position. 
Of th e In s id e r s , none is m o re po ­ lished, m ore c h a rm in g or m ore d u ra ­ ble than is C lark Clifford. lh* is alw ays gracious to the press, alw ays self-as­ sured. alw ays quietly com petent. 
Rare talent 

He has a ra re talent for rem ain in g in the background of the news, d irecting politicians as though they w ere actors on bis stage and allowing th em to take the bows. 
P e rh a p s it is this q u ality that bas help ed h im e n d u r e th r o u g h th e a d ­ m i n is tr a tio n s of fo u r p r e s i­ d e n ts

Clifford has never been afraid to say no to presidents, and he has the ability to put things in perspective and view them without emotion. 
Resumes role 
With the election of J im m y Curter. 
Clifford has resu m ed his quiet role as 
Mr. Insider. 
He has been offering advise to his fifth p re sid en t so u no btru siv ely that alm ost no one has noticed. 
At this w riting, he is on a mission in the M e d iterran ea n for the p resid en t. 
He w ill apply his special soothing salve on th e a n t a g o n i s t s in th e C y p r u s wrangle. If anyone can bring hom e a settlem ent, Clifford should.

A Soviet g o v e rn m e n t s p o k e s m a n confirmed there were injuries hut said he had no figures. U S officials here said about 17o A m ericans w ere guests ut the 3,33o-room giant Kosstya Hotel, but they had no reports th at any had been hurt.

The fire broke out at about 9 p .in, near the top of the 12-story bu ild in g p a c k e d w ith fo re ig n b u s i n e s s m e n , tourists and 
R ussians, and quickly spread to the lower floors, exploding huge g lass w indow s and filling Red 
S q u a re , a b lo ck a w a y , w ith heavy smoke. 
The Soviet news agency T a ss later sa id it w as s t a r t e d by " t e c h n i c a l trouble" in the elevator m otors of the hotel — a giant glass-sided block 223 y a r d s s q u a r e th a t d w a r f s s e v e r a l delicately designed R ussian chu rch es in its vicinity. 
At the height of the blaze, h un dred s ol guests fled intu the winter night and others trapped by the flam es scre am ed for help iii various languages.

Tin* flames were brought u nder con­ trol aller m ore than three hours. 
Localized 

" F ire spread up the well of the lifts to the upper floors of the northern w ing of the hotel," T ass said. ad d in g th at the flames were quickly localized and 
"aid was rendered to the v ictim s.” 

As scores of fire tru ck s fought the s p e c t a c u l a r b la z e , h u n d r e d s of policemen and internal-forces troops surrounded the m assiv e m o d e rn istic building.

The e n e r g y crisis has hustlers, fixers an d fire-percenters swarm ing into ll ashington like pro- spet'tors to a g o ld rush 

T he F ed e ral E nergy A dm inistration is ch arg ed with p ro tecting the public fro m th e m o r e la r c e n o u s m anipulators. 
The a g e n c y ’s secret files contain a m u ltitu d e of e n e rg y s c a n d a ls, g re a t and sm all, d atin g back to the 1973 Arab oil em bargo. 
The case of the P arish Oil "Company is a typical exam ple. 
This was a sm all M etulrie, La., oil firm which has quietly sunk into the financial q u ic k san d . But a cou ple of years ago, it w as drilling for oil in the back room s of go vernm ent. 
The com pany clam o red for fuel allo­ cations by the millions of gallons, far- m o re fuel th an it a p p e a re d to need. 
These oil explorations w ere directed by an i n g r a ti a ti n g c o m p a n y e x e c u tiv e nam ed Ray Morton. 
Best route 
He quickly found thai the hest route to the F ed eral E n e rg y A dm inistration was through the offices of a powerful politician. 
Once he used then-Speaker Carl Al- liert’s office to a rra n g e a m eeting with the right people at the FEA . 
Morton e m erg ed trium ph antly from this m eeting with the opening that led to a precious fuel allocation for P arish 
Oil. 
I n c i d e n ta l ly , w e ’ve le a r n e d th a t 
Morton was put in touch with F E A by 
A l b e r t ’s f o r m e r a s s i s t a n t , H o w ard 
Y ourm an, who told us he had looked upon Morton us a constituent. 
Of course. A lbert represented O kla­ homa. and Morton lived in Louisiana. 
But Y o u rm an exp lained that M orton had som ething to do with an oil firm in 
A lbert’s hom e district. 
Again in Ju ly , 1973, Morton turned up in th e F E A ’s offices in New O r ­ leans. He m entioned that a politician had offered to get oil for P a ris h for 
$5o,ooo. P a rish never got the oil. but the FE A began investigating the bribe request. 
Going in circles 
F o r the en su in g 18 m o nths, the in­ vestigation has been going around in circles. 
Two rival F E A offices spent part of th e tim e c h a s i n g o ne a n o th e r in a bew ildering ring-uround-the-rosy. 
T h e A tla n ta r e g i o n a l o ffic e h ad au th o rity ov er th e P a ris h oil a llo c a ­ tion. so A tlanta began the in v e s tig a ­ tion. But the Dallas regional office had jurisdiction over New O rleans. 
The Dallas office beca m e offended, therefore, when the A tlanta office in­ vestigated the New O rle a n s office — and the w rong people in New O rleans at that. 
This infuriated Del Fow ler, the head of the D allas office. 
Ile threatened to a rre st any Atlanta investigators who infringed on his ju r ­ isdiction. F o w le r then took o v e r the investigation, which grounded to a halt iii 1973 but h as now been re op ened . 
Inside sources say it is close to co m ­ pletion. 
We contacted Morton who refe rred us to the erstw hile president of Parish, 
Ja m e s R ichard Vermillion. T he latter d e sc rib e d th e c a se as a ‘‘m i s u n d e r ­ standing."

Republicans to zero in on legislatures in 1978 

By JAMES Met KORY 

The National Republican Party in­ tends to make strenuous efforts iii the im m e d ia te y e a rs ah e ad to c a p tu re state legislatures. 
Reason? To protect the party’s pre­ sent congressmen and those congress­ men the parts hopes to elect in 1978 and 198o 
I hilt was part of the message Re­ publican National Chairman Bill Brock imiught to the National Federation of 
Republican Women Friday night. 
The board of the 23o,ooo-niember fe­ deration is w inding up a three-day m eeting in San Antonio. B rock a d ­ dressed the group ut a banquet in the 
Hilton Palaeio del Rio Hotel. 
“ We a r e u n d e r-o rg a n iz e d and over-concentrated at the top," Brock, a former U.S. senator from Chattanooga, 
Tenn., told the women. 
"W e have to get hack into the pre­ cinct.” 
Republican congressional winners iii 
1978 and 1986, Brock warned, will he constantly in danger of being g e rry ­ 

 mandered out of existence as a result of Hit' next reap p o rtio n m en t of con­ gressional districts in 1981. 
"W e cannot afford to waste our re­ sources and the energy of our con­ gressional candidates and their su p ­ porters unless we hack them in the state legislatures.” Brock. 46, assert­ ed. 
It is time. the new party chairm an said, to rebuild the base of the party, rev ive its spirit and restore the voice of 
“ the unheard Americans." 
Brock said there is no higher priority for the GOP than the election of a Re­ publican m ajority to the state house 

 and state senate in every slate, 
"T h a t’s the critical target," lie sa id. 

In a press conference preceding the banquet, Brock said women are the base of the Republican party, and be would like to see more of them running for office. 
He said he wouldn’t Im* surprised to see a woman running for president or vice president. He pointed to T ex as’

As a hedge to m ake su re all pro ­ mised benefits are realized, Mayor 
Cockrell said the final closing will not occur for several months 
This gives the city an option to hack out should some unforeseen problems develop, sin* noted 
C enteno critique attacked 

Objections raised by Eloy Centeno. vice chairm an of City Public Serv ice, to Hie proposed settlement plan wit Ii 
Lo-Vaeu (lathering Co. are not valid, 
UPS attorneys said Friday. 
Mayor Lila Cockrell distributed a detailed response p rep a re d by the attorneys to claim s set out by Centeno in newspaper advertisem ents Friday. 
Centeno specifically attacked a gas search program that would he under­ taken by a new company that will he created if the settlement is approved. 
He said benefits from the program would he more than offset by a higher rate Lo-Vaca will he allowed to charge; its m ajor custom ers such as San An­ tonio. 
CPS attorneys said Centeno did not prove his point. And tin* gas search program would provide some cushion a g a in s t p ric e in c re a s e s from p r o ­ ducers who sell to Lo-Vaca, CPS at­ torneys pointed out iii their response.

He not only gave p re­ sidential blood hut it was also a type th a t flows through the veins of only six per cent of all Am er­ icans. 
Rod Cross officials said it was the firs t tim e w ithin m e m o ry — ur perhaps ever — that a 
P re sid e n t has do n ated blood. 

The county medical exam iner F'ri* day positively identified the rem ains of a woman found iii Northeast Bexar as that of a missing County Courthouse employe, 
The woman was identified as Nancy

Mrs Paul F'rese of 314 ( restwind St. in 
U indcrest. 
Medical Exam iner Dr. Ruben Santos ruled the death a homicide and said 
Hu* likely cause of death was asphyx­ iation due to strangulation. 
The w o m an ’s badly decom posed body was found face down in an iso­ lated brushy area about IOO feet from 
Bulverde Road, just north of Evans 
Road, sheriff’s investigators said.

A heil from the housecoat she wa* w earing was knotted tightly around lier neck , le ad in g in v e s tig a to rs to theorize she had been strangled, ac­ cording to LL Alfred Carroon of the sheriff’s office. 
C a n eon said the woman was last

 million appropriation for the utility crisis intervention program. 
The program is designed to prevent utility cutoffs because of nonpayment of bills. 
It cost $3.5 million last year, a 
Community Services Adm inistration spokesman said, to help 49,o(1o families throughout the country. 
S.A. families 

In San Antonio, the Economic Op­ portunities Development Corp. distri­ buted $6,3oo to 293 families between last April I and Jan. 31. 
Muskie press secretary Bob Rose said the $3oo million proposal was ori­ ginally intended for the Northeast states hit by the bitter cold winter. 
"But when we got into it. we found the problem is nationwide — about 4o states had temperatures below aver­ age,” Rose said. 
To qualify for the payments. Rose said, a family will have to show eligi­ bility and need. 
Eligibility is measured by income. A family of four will have to have an annual income of less than about $6,9oo or 125 per cent of the poverty level. 
Rose said. 

Need is demonstrated by a threat of utility cutoff. 

The money will be distributed to the 
9oo community action agencies — in­ cluding EODC — according to a for­ mula which includes the number of people living under the poverty level, the cost of fuel and the severity of the weather. Rose said. 
San Antonio utility customers, who have not suffered from the extreme temperatures, have seen the average utility bill jump from about $2o per month in 1973 to more than $41 last year. 
EODC official Laura Cisneros said that agency has received many calls for help on the utility bills, but lacks the resources to help many of the callers. 
Mrs. Cisneros is director of moni­ toring and evaluation for EODC. 
Average case 

She said the average payment made in San Antonio is approximately $2o. 
Rose said Muskie’s proposal calls for a $25o ceiling for payments to a utility company or to an individual for pre­ payed fuel deliveries. 
Only one payment is allowed per family. 
Rose said Muskie hopes for action on the bill soon from a House subcom­ mittee.

Lebanon as right-w ing 
Christian forces sought to flush out Palestinian guerrillas from their last stronghold on the Israeli b o rd e r, a g o v e rn m e n t spokesman reported. 
At le a st 25 p e rs o n s were wounded and four houses w recked as the leftist Moslem held vil­ lage of Taire, five miles north of Isra e l, ca m e under a daylong barrage of Chriatian artillery, the spokesman reported. 
H and-to-hand com bat was reported flaring on the o u ts k i r ts of B in t

At stake is a hill that co n tro ls traffic routes through Bint Jbeil from 
Christian strongholds on the western foothills of 
ML Hermon to the Medi­ terranean coast 2o miles westward. 
The town. three miles from the Israeli frontier, has a p o p u la tio n of 
15.ooo. More than half of the inhabitants have al­ ready fled and the fresh resurgence of hostilities has panicked the rest into a frantic evacuation, one official reported.

By DEBORAH W ESER 
A South Side citizens group is out to challenge the use of voter registration lists for jury selec­ tion. 
The group. Volunteers Organized In 
C o m m u n ity E ffo rt (V O IC E ), said many people are reluctant to register to vote because they know the list is used as the basis for jury duty selec­ tion. spokesman Don Green said F ri­ day. 
“ T aking n am es off voters lists is discouraging a great m any of them from re g is te rin g ,’’ G reen told Com ­ missioners Court in a surprise plea for court support of VOICE’S impending challenge. 
Study 
The issue was taken under study at the urging of Judge Blair Reeves but both Coms. Jeff Wentworth and Albert 
Bustam ante expressed interest in the challenge. 
Neither court m em b ers nor Green actually offered alternative jury selec­ tion proposals during the discussion but B ustam ante suggested taking the m atter to the state legislature. 
State rules govern jury selection now and call for using voter registration lists. The present selection rules also 
.contain detailed conditions for waiving jury service. 
J u ry selection is actually c e n tra ­ lized through a system supervised by the district court judges here. 
Green said it is difficult to convince people they very likely will not be called to serve on a jury in any given year. They are worried jury duty will jeopardize their jobs. Green explained. 
Called 
Judge Reeves pointed out only about 
2o,ooo persons are called each year for jury service, out of a voter registration list of about m ore than 3oo,ooo names. 
Wentworth, m eanwhile, said poten­ tial voters in his Northeast Bexar pre­ cinct also show reluctance to register because of the list’s connection with jury duty selection. 
The economic issue is not the ques­ tion there as much as disinterest, he 

 said, adding: “ People just don’t want to be bothered. They don’t want that hassle (jury duty) in their lives.” 
In other action, com m issioners a p ­ proved submission of a $333,4oo grant application for second-year funding of the Metropolitan Youth Agency, a joint eity-county service unit dealing with ju v en ile d e lin q u e n c y and re la te d problems. 
Also approved was a second grant application seeking $191,3oo for con­ trac t p u rch a ses for the MY A. Both grants go to the Criminal Justice Di­ vision of the Governor’s Office in Aus­ tin but will tap federal funds available at the state level. 
Commissioners, following an execu­ tive session, almost doubled the salary of Reeves’s adm inistrative assistant, 
Ed Day. 
Day, 33, a recent g ra d u a te of St. 
M ary’s University Law School, will get 
$1,354. His previous salary had been 
$757 a month.

 dent Carter and a group of Senate-House leaders last Tuesday that com­ m ittee m em bers and staff had been placed under surveillance. 
Ridiculous 
Carter, in a statement to the Washington Post, denied that m em bers were placed under either 
FBI or CIA surveillance and Carter was quoted as saying he didn’t think 
Inouye had said “ any­ thing so ridiculous.” 
Presidential news se ­ cretary .Jody Powell said 
Inouye lar ks authority to order surveillance of an­ yone and that Carter has not done so. 
Carter and Inouye were m iffed at news sto n es that the CIA was making huge payments to foreign leaders over the years. 

Charter an d Inouye were m iffed at news sto ries the CIA was m ak in g huge g arm en ts to fo re ig n lead ers over the years 

Several senators who attended an Intelligence 
Committee meeting said flatly Inouye told them the FB I had been in­ structed to observe him and other senators at di­ plomatic receptions and parties to insure that no foreign intelligence oper­ ators attempted to make contact. 

It was not clear whether any FBI moni­ toring had taken place but sources reported no electronic surveillance of anv kind was involved. 

Sen. P atrick Moyni- han, D-NY., reportedly asked Inouye to strike him from the list of those to be watched. 
In his denial statement 
Friday night, Inouye said he had authorized the 
FBI and 
CIA to 
“ prom ptly inform the 

 com m ittee of in form a­ tion regarding the acti­ vities of foreign intelli­ gence services which are directed at m embers of the com m ittee and the committee staff.” 
He said no surveillance has taken place thus far. 

Infiltration 
Sen. Gary Hart, D-Col , said he understood 
Inouye to have m eant that he wanted to be sure there was no foreign in­ telligence penetration of the committee. 

Three White House sources said they got a much different im pres­ sion from Inouye’s re­ m arks at the m eeting with Carter. 

One said Inouye had used the word “ surveil­ lance” and said it was without the knowledge of committee members. 

Inouye was a promin­ ent member of the Senate 
W atergate Com m ittee that in vestigated m em bers of the Nixon administration.

SASD found innocent of fund misuse 

The Texas Education 
Agency Friday cleared the San Antonio School 
D istrict of charges of misuse of federal funds in the $49 million bond election. 
T EA ’s findings were announced on the eve of 
Saturday’s bond election. 
The investigation came after Charlotte Travis, former school bourd can­ didate, and three other district residents sent a telegram to Gov. Dolph 
Briscoe charging the dis­ trict had established a political boiler room. 
Referred it 
The governor referred the matter to the Texas 
Education Agency. 
Alton Bowen, deputy commissioner with TEA, said his Investigation had revealed no w rongdoing. 
The telegram alleged a 
Bonham 
Elem entary 
School teacher had been removed from her class­ room temporarily to make room for four tele­ phones to be used to pro­ mote the bond issue. 
According to the tele­ gram, the teacher could not teach her students in the m akeshift quarters and was told to spend her tim e in the teach er’s lounge. 
Bowen said the school administration was try­ ing to find a better way to handle the overload of phone calls regarding tho bond issue.

Now you can have a beautiful green lawn 

 without work or worry thanks to liquid fertilizers applied by a-Perm-o-Green. 

A greener lawn is what you'll notice first— usually within IO to 14 days after we first spray your lawn. 
It will be greener because it is healthier. Greener because a-Perin-o-Green’s nutrients are promoting a deep root system and strong steins and blades. 
You'll notice something else too, no chinch bug or grub worm problems because a-Perm-o-Green applies the correct insecticide at the right time— before damage is done, 
Join the thousands who are enjoying greener, healthier lawns thanks to a-Perm-o-Green applica­ tion* last year. Your satisfaction is assured or you don’t owe us a cent. 

Why is a-Perm-o-Green so effective? 

Your lawn is sprayed with liquid fertilizer specially prepared bv a-Perm-o-Green to meet current soil, temperature and moisture conditions. 
Nutritional elements plus nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are seasonally adjusted to promote the growth most beneficial at the time of application 
Research proves that proper nutrition— rather than the soil itself— make* the difference between success and failure in creating a beautiful lawn. And creating beautiful lawns is what a-Perm-o-Green is all about 

Average Cost? (.ess than $2o per application. 
Seems amazingly low, but a-Perm-a-Green is able to buy fertilizers and insecticides in quantity and pass the savings on to you. The average size lawn really 

 does average less than $2o per application— about the sam e as if you bought m aterials and applied them yourself (not counting the trips you’d make to the fertilizer store, the time and gam ble over the correct mix to use, and the spreader equipm ent you’d have to rent or buy!) 

W hen do you join the program? Now! 

Over the next few w eeks our lawn care profes­ sionals will take the a-Perm -o-Green trucks out to spray this year’s first treatm ents on law ns throughout this area. 
M ake sure your home is one o f our first stops. Cull us right now!

WASHINGTON - The 
While House released the financial statements of 15 
Cabinet level officials 
Friday, identifying their financial holdings and corporate ties, but not listing their specific net worths. 
The statements, which the White House called unprecedented, were re­ leased as a result of a prom ise by President 
Carter to require a full, public disclosure of fin­ ancial holdings of offi­ cials in policy-making positions. 
While specific net worths were not released, coded listing of stocks and other holdings pro­ vided a general range of individual worth. 
It appeared clear that 
Treasury Secretary Mi­ chael Blumenthal; Bort 
Lance, head of the Office of 
M anagem ent and 
Budget and Welfare Se­ cretary Joseph Califano are among the wealth­ iest On the other end of the scale are U.N. Am- basasador 
Andrew 
Young and Labor Secre­ tary Ray Marshall.

Canadian wheat deal is nought 

WASHINGTON 
- 
A griculture S ecretary 
Bob Bergland says he in­ tends to seek a wheat price-fixing deal with 
Caanada that would ef­ fectively set a world price on bread grain 
In response to a ques­ tion, Bergland said the proposal is linked to price fixing of the foreign oil cartel, adding; ‘i ’d be willing to drop these talks with anybody when the oil c a rte l is d is­ solved.” 
The LLS and Canada sell about 75 per cent of world wheat exports and this would effectively set world prices.

By JAMES MCCRORY 
With the deadline for filing three days off, candidates for 
City Council in the April 2 elec­ tion are campaigning as hard as if the election was tomorrow. 
Mayor Lila Cockrell, who plans to file for re-election Monday, F rid a y claimed support from an impressive list of black leaders. 
At a gathering of about inn East Side leaders and residents, Rick Greene, a citizens advocate and m em ber of the 
Black Student Coalition, said the hat­ chet had been buried between citizens action groups and the m ayor over a walk-out incident earlier this year. 
Endorsements 
O thers endorsing Mrs. Cockrell in her bid for re-election at the meeting were two fo rm er black councilm en. 
Dr. R. L. Hilliard and the Rev. S. ll

Two of the m ayor’s m ajor opponents, 
Dr. Jose San M artin and John Mon­ s e y , also had politics on their minds for the weekend. 
Both men filed Friday. 
San Martin is to address persons a t­ tending a reception in his honor at 29o7 
Marlborough Drive. The reception, at the hom e of D r. and M rs. G eo rg e 
Mayer, is scheduled from 3 to 6 p.m. 
Saturday. San Martin is to speak at 
3:45 p.m. 
Monfrey will throw out the first ball at the first annual Joe Lerm a M emor­ ial T o u rn a m e n t S a tu rd a y , and will campaign in Brackenridge P ark Sun­ day. 
Backs issue 
City Councilman Glen Hartm an F ri­ day announced his endorsement of the 
$5o million San Antonio School District bond election. He said it would prevent the exodus of residents from the city to the “ bedroom b u rg s.’’ and will help protect tax values in the district. 

Mayor praises park plan 

Mayor Lila Cockrell Friday told 
South Side supporters the national park designation she seeks for the missions will be a major economic asset tor the area. 

The mayor spoke to a group of 25 
South Side leaders at a breakfast at 
K ath erin e's 
R estau ran t, 
2717

The mayor expressed optim ism about the progress of necessary legislation sponsored by I S. Rep. 
Abraham Hazen. 

H artm an is a candidate for re-elec­ tion from District 9. 
Another candidate from District 9. 
Jim Dement, said a city councilman who interferes with the w orkings of city staff responsibilities violates the city charter and slows down the pro­ cess of good city management . 
A City council m em ber, he said, has no business interfering with the pro­ fessional staff and management 
Learned 
As a man who has run his own busi­ ness for 31 years, Dement said, he’s learned “ if you hire a trained prnfes sional to do a specific job, the job will be done best w ith no ou tsid e m e d ­ dling.’’ 
City Council m e m b e r s , he sa id , should be p rim arily concerned with policy s e ttin g , and not b eco m e in ­ volved in day to day workings of city staff offices. 
Jose Estala. candidate from District 
8. criticized the City Water Board for approving w ater main funds of $149,ooo for two North Side subdivisions outside 
•the city limits. 
He also questioned the board s a p ­ proval of $2oo,ooo to “ cam ouflage a city water tower.” The money, he said. should be spent for the benefit of peo­ ple living in older sections of the city who have serious water and drainage problems.

Hunt: Panama slaying plotted 
GONZALEZ TRIAL 

BOSTON (AP) — Convicted W ater­ g ate b u rg la r E. Howard Hunt said 
F rid a y th a t he believed the W hite 
House “ Plum bers” once plotted to as­ s a s s in a te the head of the P a n a m a government. 
Hunt, who was released from prison 
Wednesday, said the Central 
Intel­ ligence Agency was u n h ap p y w ith 
Brig. Gen. Om ar Torrijos, P an am a's head of governm ent, because he a l­ legedly allowed illegal drugs to move through his country. 
Hunt did not say when the alleged plot occurred, which m em bers of the 
Plumbers were involved or how far the plans had progressed. 
" P a n a m a was a d ru g tra ffic k in g an'a where drugs could move easily, the CIA thought with the blessing of the P anam anian gov ern m en t," Hunt said. “ I think the feeling was that if 
Torrijos didn't shape up and cooper­ ate, he was going to be wasted. 
“ That never happened. I didn’t know any of the people who were asked to participate other than the people in the 
Plumbers unit. They had that as part of their brief." 
Hunt commented in an interview on 

 the “ Good Day” program on WCVB- 
TV. 

D uring the W a te rg a te e ra , the 
Plumbers took part in several secret operations for the White House Among them was the break-in at the office of 
Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist. 

Hunt was a member of the Plum bers, but he said he had not been personally involved in the Torrijos plot. 
Hunt p la n s to go on a n a tio n a l speaking tour.

 lion of the total. The remaining bond funds plus interest gained through time deposit of these funds will finance air conditioning of elem entary and middle schools and rehabilitation ol the Bonham and Austin Elem entaries 
— the oldest schools in the district. 
District Supl Harold Hitt has said the bond issue’s passage will cost approx­ imately $2 million a year. 
District officials project a property 

 tax increase to finance the bond issue from $1.82 per $1oo bf assessed valua­ tion to $2.1o per $1oo. 
More than 64 organizations including the San Antonio T eacher’s Council and 
Com m unities Organized for Public 
Service as well as 87 PTA groups have endorsed the program. 
Opposition to the issue has surfaced in recent days from two groups, the 
A larm ed T axpayers SASD and the 
Texans for Freedom. 

 of a firm which was to m arket com ­ modities from Mexico. 
Gonzalez testified that other incor­ porators included Judge Gutierrez and 
J o s e M ata an d th a t he (G onzalez) never invested any money in that firm. 
Gonzalez again denied having any in te r e s t in th e C ris la l H eady Mix

Cantu w hile a school employe. 
Loan 
The defendant said he had loaned 
I antu $2,oo1) but did not know what the money was to be used for. 
A ssistant atto rn ey general G erald 
C arruth asked, “ Would you loan me 
$2,ooo?” 
Gonzalez drew chuckles from the courtroom when ho replied ‘T m com­ pletely broke Mr Carruth, I’m sorry. 
Gonzalez said Dinero Inc., at one tim e, began to purchase land to be used to build low cost apartm ents for te a c h e r s but th a t the p ro je c t fell through. 
C arruth asked Gonzalez how many hot school lunches the total of $13,ooo paid Cantu would have bought. 
“ I d id n ’t g iv e th a t (th e m o n ey ) away,” Gonzalez replied. 
School building 

Gonzalez, under questioning, said he did not know if a two-story building by the school district through Carnegie 
Foundation money was purchased by 

Dinero Inc., or by Gamez personally.

Flores said he never saw Cantu at the work site and Calderon said he/saw him only once when he was directing a cem ent truck to a location where ce­ ment was to be dumped. 
Defense attorney 
In his closing arg u m e n ts, defense attorney Bill H ardberger accused the sta te of su b je c tin g G onzalez “ to a mountain of abuse.” 
He said, “ Putting this man in such jeopard is an outrage." 
C arruth, in his closing argum ent, said it was true the jury stood between the state and the defendant but that the jury in fact is the state. 
“ My obligation is to you,” he said. 

Gonzalez was indicted on the theft charge June 16, 1976. 
The 47-year-old Gonzalez w as also indicted on two counts of official m is­ conduct in connection with the hiring of Cantu. 
The misconduct trial is still pending. 
After Friday’s verdict, Gonzalez said that for the last nine months he and his fam ily had been p e rs e c u te d by 
“ Adolph Briscoe, John Hill and Jerry 
Carruth.” the Asst. Texas Atty. Gen. who prosecuted the case. 

“ Unless the people of this state rid themselves of men like these and un­ just people like the Texas Rangers, the 
Mexican-Am ericans and poor whites, who don’t m arch to their tune, will never have any constitutional rights, " said a tearful Gonzalez as his family stood around him. 
Gonzalez said he was persecuted be­ cause he ran a g a in st U.S. Rep. E. 
“ Kika” De La Garza. 
Gonzalez added he was leaving Tex­ as to accept a position with the Oak­ land, Calif., school district.

WASHINGTON (A P ) 
— An American delega­ tion headed by United 
Auto Workers President 
Leonard Woodeoek will travel to 
Vietnam in m id-M arch to seek an accounting of Americans missing in that country, the S tate D e p a rtm e n t announced Friday. 

Spokesman Frederick 
Z. Brown said a parallel o b jectiv e of the five- m em ber commission will be to discuss with Viet­ n am ese a u th o rities the possibility of esta b lish ­ ing m o re n o rm a l r e l a ­ tions with Hanoi. 
Brown said the United 
States is also in contact with Laos in hopes of a r­ ranging a similar visit to that country. 
He said there has been no com m unication with 
Cambodia b ec au se the prospects for cooperation w ith th a t c o u n try are 
“ not encouraging.” 
Members 

T he re m a in in g members of the commis­ sion will be selected later. It was understood th a t no U.S. ex ecu tiv e branch officials will be chosen as members. 
There are about 2,55o m issin g A m e ric a n s in southeast Asia, all but 
8UU of which have been declared dead. 
The 8oo are listed as missing in action, al­ though a special Ionise c o m m itte e recen tly reported that there is lit­ tle hope that any of the 
MIAs are still alive. - 
Of the 2,55o. abodt 56o are missing in Laos, 8o in 
C am bodia and the remainder in Vietnam.

 would be in charge of adm inistration and the com m ittee’s budget. 
The com mittee is scheduled to die on 
M arch 31 unless the House votes to continue its work. Wright said an ex­ tension probably would be voted if the 
Gonzalez-Sprague battle is resolved. 
W right said he would recom m end that the investigators concentrate first on the King killing. 
“ From what I’ve been told,” he said 
•“ there may be reason to believe that the M artin L uther King ( a s s a s s in a ­ tion) is more potentially productive.’’ 
T h e m a jo rity le a d e r sa id H ouse 
S p eak er T h o m as P. " T i p ” O’Neill, 
D-Mass. had asked him to play “ dove of p e a c e ’’ betw een G o n za lez and 
Sprague. 

"It's not so easy,” he. said, “ I’m in the posture of a Marrying Sam trying to perform a shotgun wedding when neither side wants to get m arried.” 
The com m ittee’s public information officer said Sprague had not agreed to the majority leader’s proposals. 

G onzalez had no c o m m e n t on 
W right’s order Friday night. His wife said he was confined to his sick bed and there was no phone in the room. 
“ He does not have a statement on the situation now,” Mrs. Gonzalez said. 

To date, Sprague has refused to per­ m it G o n za le z’ new s ta ff d ir e c to r , 
Brooten, to enter the com m ittee’s of­ fices. But Wright said he was confident the two men could work together if the com m ittee’s work goes on.

 would be a good candidate for any of­ fice. 
There aren't as many things dividing the Republican party as are pictured, 
Brock av e rre d . He added th e re are more things uniting the party than di­ viding it. 
Precinct level 
The party, he stressed, m ust build from the ground and the precinct up and become more inclusive rather than exclusive. The party, he said. suffered by putting too much dependency on the presidency and allowing erosion on the state and local levels. 
He said the GOF* must seek out able candidates on all levels of government, from constable on up. 
The chairm an said he doesn t anti­ cipate any “ s tr ik in g ’’ gain s by the 
GOP in C ongress unless th e re is a serio u s do w n tu rn in th e A m erican economy. 
Big business 
The picture of the GGP as the party of big business, Brock asserted, is one 
“ of the great frauds in the American political process." 
Last year, he said, records reflect 55 per cent of big business political action committee money went to Democrats, not Republicans. 
He added 7o per cent of the money contributed to R epublicans, by con­ trast, cam e from individuals and was in sums of $1o or less 
Big business. Brock averred, is apo­ litical, and some big businessmen try to buy access to * (ingress. 
Reporting he is against public fin­ ancing of elections, particularly pro­ posals the check-off be expanded from the president to Include the Senate ami the House, Brock said such an exten­ sion would freeze incumbents in office. 

W ILLIAM BROCK

The incumbents, he pointed out, al­ ready have a trem endous advantage over their opponents. 
Incumbent m em bers of the House, he said, have half a million dollars a year in public funds not available to opponents. 
He said there is obvious abuse by o ffice-holders ta k in g a d v a n ta g e of their free franking privilege to send out campaign literature just before the elections. . 
Brock said it is too early in the P re­ sident Carter adm inistration to assess it. but he did say the proposal to give out $5o rebates will do nothing to sti­ mulate the economy. 
. 
The rebate, he said, doesn’t deal with the econom ic problem and ig­ nores the needs of the young and m in­ ority groups.

Bridges, I 5 sh ow the spot w here they found the cash 

 delinquent on the m a r ­ ijuana charge. D isposi­ tion til his case has been transferred to Alice. 
Both boys have been suspended from school for truancy. 
Garcia is living with his parents. 
B rid g e s lives w ith his mother and stepfather in 
Robstown, near Alice. 
One Los Angeles-based movie producer said the boys will m ake a profit 
“ in six figures” for the rights to their story. 
“ I just want to get my money out of the hank and m y c a r out of the garage,” said Bridges.

A SSO C IA T E D PRESS 
WACO — When the two te e n -a g e rs left th e ir 
South Texas home, they had only the clothes oil their backs, two ounces of m a riju a n a and two suitcases — stuffed with nearly $5o11,11oo in cash. 
T h u s eq u ip p ed for a trip to C hicago, they launched a bizarre, often comical, two-day spend­ ing spree. It ended in the 
Waco jail d ru n k ta n k w here a p ro s titu te of­ fered to marry’ them. 
The Alice high school s o p h o m o re s . 
D ean 
B ridges, 15, and P ercy 
Garcia. IB. say they dug up the cash from a hiding place on 
B rid g e s' father’s ranch and found that with $5oo. OOO you can: 
• Pay a bellboy $5,ooo to buy a 1977 T h u n d e r­ bird for $8,ooo in cash and drive it off a Dallas showroom floor. 
• Give $1oo g ifts to winos and $2o tips in waiters. 
• Stay at a (low ii tow ii 
D allas hotel and go on shopping sprees to buy c a m e ra s , clo th es and stereo equipment. 
The money, in $2o. $5o and $1oo hills, now sits in a Waco hank w hile a grand jury investigates its source. The car, with less than 5oo miles on it, is gathering dust in the 
M cLennan County g a r ­ age. 
Bridges’ father, Jam es 
I Proms (Bridges uses his s te p f a th e r ’s n a m e ) , a w e ld e r 'a n d ra c e h o rs e ow ner, w ent to jail in 
Alice on Thursday rather than te stify about the orig in of the m oney, which south Texas law en fo rc e m en t o ffic ers believe is related to drug smuggling. 
“ Nobody keeps that kind of m oney aro u n d hero for groceries." said one officer, ex p lain in g that Alice is at the cross­ ro ad s of n o rth b o u n d m a riju a n a p ip e lin e s from Mexico. 
B rid g e s ’ a tto rn e y s have filed a formal claim for the cash and Garcia's attorneys say they might claim it. T he In te rn a l 
K evenue S erv ice has filed a $3oo,ooo lien. 
” 1 want to drive that ear out ut the g a ra g e.’ 

B rid g es sa id as he brushed dust from the blue auto. “ I ’ve got a good lawyer. I think I’ve got a good chance to get 

 lugged the two suitcases of cash to the bus station. 
Bridges had cram m ed his father's Hmm auto­ matic pistol in his under­ wear, where it kept slip­ ping down his leg, and 
Garcia left his mother a note saying he’d be back soon. 
The teen-agers nearly lost the m oney tw ice, they said. 
In San Antonio, they left the suitcases on the bus during a stop. 
Drunk 

“ We w ere drunk. We just got off the bus and left the $5oo,ooo on it,” said Bridges. The s u it­ cases w ere still th e re when they reboarded. 
A fter a rriv in g at a 
Dallas hotel, Bridges and 
Gareia filled their pock­ ets with about $6,ooo each aud left for a shopping trip . They shoved the money filled s u itc a se s under their bed and left about $2 in change on a table 
“ When we got back, we found out the maid had stole the ch an g e.’’ said 
Bridges. “ There was half a million dollars in cash under the bed.” 
At a 
D allas b ar. 
Bridges offered $1,ooo to 
G ilbert Bailey, a wiry- haired Brazilian bellhop who spoke with a thick accent, as a fee to buy them a car. Neither boy had a driver’s license. 
After the Youths count­ ed out $1o,ooo in $1oo bills al the d ea lersh ip s, the three backed the $8,8oo c a r off th e show room floor. 
Kept the rest 

Bailey, who kept the ex tra $2,ooo, was la ter detained by customs of­ ficials in M iam i. F la., w here he was w aving handfuls of bills. 
The teen-agers had set out for Chicago because, 
“ It looked like as far away from Alice as you could go." But they made a wrong turn and ended up in W aco, IOO m iles south of Dallas. 
■ We had smoked some joints and d runk som e beer and that was when we got lo s t,” said 
Bridges. He was driving when a rookie Waco pa­ tro lm a n stopped the 

 youths for running a red light, about 36 h o u rs after they had left Alice. 
They stayed in jail four days after police found the gun and m arijuana. 
They were very popular with o th e r in m a te s , 
Bridges said. 
Proposal 
“ One of the prosti­ tutes in the next cell even offered to m arry us if we would buy her a car.” he said. 
Bridges has since been cleared of the weapons possession ch a rg e, but 
G arcia w as d e c la re d 

T he s le n d e r, shy 
Bridges said in an inter­ view with The Associated 
Press that he had known for five m o n th s th a t so m e th in g v alu a b le — m aybe m oney — w as b u ried on his f a th e r ’s barren, dusty ranch near 
Alice in a q u ail pen, g u ard ed by two d o b e r­ man p inschers and S a­ tan, a vicious G e rm a n shepherd attack dog. 
Watched burial 
“ I seen somebody bury it there," Bridges said. 
“ I looked out my window from my room one night ut dusk and w atch ed him.” 
Bridges said that after a fight with his fath e r 
Jan. 29. he decided lo get w h atev er was b u ried th e re and " g e t as far away from Alice as we could." 
Bridges said he easily pacified the dogs and dug for the money with G ar­ eia. a former high school football player, and a n ­ o th er te e n -a g e r, Jo h n 
Rose. 
‘‘We were going crazy, th ro w in g up d irt until 
P ercy th re w his pick down th e re and hit s o m e th in g ,’’ sa id 
B rid g es. 
“ We w ere ju m p in g aro u n d and yelling, ‘You hit it! You hit it! We struck it rich!’ 
The m oney was iii 
$1o,ooo packets in a red ice chest. Garcia said a piece of notebook paper with “ 5oo.ooo” scrawled on it was the first thing he saw when he opened the chest. 
Getaway 
“ My first thought was to get a car and go as far away from Texas as we could," added Bridges. 
“ All I could say was 
Wow!’ ’’ said Garcia. "I just kept saving it." 
The cash wouldn’t fit into one big suitcase. "It was so heavy the handle broke and the suitcase fell in the m u d ,” said 
Bridges, 
The youths gave Rose 
$4,ooo. stuffed their jeans with handfuls of bills aud

It’s tim e to settle on gas plan for city 

San Antonio is at that time when it must decide whether a bird in the hand is worth two unidentified Hying objects iii the bush. 
City Council will count votes 
M onday m o r n in g to s e e how m an y cou n cil m e m b e r s will stand by tin* com m itm ent to a so-called “ bottom -line” settle­ m ent of the c o m p le x d isp u te over a natural gas supply for 
San Antonio. 
The settlement proposal, it­ self, is relatively simple to un­ derstand. 
Other factors that are extre­ mely important to consider are equally simple to understand. 
For exam ple. San Antonio's contract for gas expires in five years. 
Litigation for damages is still ahead — all of it. Even pre-trial skirmishing over a trial site is unfinished. 
But the clearest and bluntest fact is that options that have been proposed are, at best, far riskier than prudent negotiators lu n e been w illin g to r e c o m ­ mend. 
The settlement proposal has been improved from early offers by about 4o per cent 
San An­ tonio's share of the benefits are estimated at about $84. Hi million 
—- in total items — plus bene­ fits of a gas search program 
That p r o g r a m is the only av a ila b le offer to reduce the 

 price of gas to San Antonio. 
Price control for in-state gas is a remote prospect because the tide is running against controls arid in favor of free-market prices. 
The reason the dispute hasn t been se ttle d e a r lie r is that 
Coastal States was found to lack the gas it claimed to have. So far, nobody has found a way to overcome that fact. 
Thus, gas supply — not a de­ livery system or even damages 
— remains tin4 single most im ­ portant consideration on behalf of this c o m m u n i t y ’s g e n e r a l w e lfa re. It will be up to the spuuoff New Company (Lo-Vaca and other Coastal States assets that must have d em on strated value of at least $24o m illion under t lit* s e t tle m e n t) to find gas to furnish San Antonio. 
That company needs stability of independence, which it lacks until a settlem ent is made, in order to arrange for long-term gas supply. By long-term, we m ean m o r e than m onth-to- month, as is now the case. 
We anticipate a council m a ­ jority understands the wisdom of ta k ing the bird in hand. 
Heavy political pressure will be 
(‘valuated against facts of the situation and that s uncomforta­ ble but responsible. We’d bkt* to see a return to 25 cent gas and 
Oscar Wyatt stripped, but w e ’d rather have gas. 
A nother E ntebbe tor Amin bas attention o f Am ericans 

 has A m e r i c a ’s 
Idi 
A m in attention. 
The Ugandan president has ordered the 25o Americans in his 
Fast African country to meet him Monday. Meantime, he has refused to let them leave. 
I'his is tin* man w ho threa­ tened to e x e c u te a Briton for once c alling Amin “ a village tyrant.” F orm er F N. A m b a s ­ sador and now Sen. Daniel Pa­ trick M oynihan on ce ca lle d 
A m in “ a racist m u r d e r e r ” 
(quoting the New York rimes) for A m i n ’s proposal to e x t e r ­ minate Israel. 
But it was over the British teacher iii Uganda, Denis Hills, and the tyrant remark that Amin pulled his c e le b r a te d d ram a. 
Hills was sentenced to die. The 
British foreign secretary filially flew to Kam pala and secured 

Hills' release. Amin, after an incredibly-childish show of bul­ bing, said tin' release proved he wasn't mad. 
Ironically, som e Fast Afri­ can papers cr ed ited A m i n ’s coup to grab power from Milton 
Obote to lilt* I . 
S. 
But this week Amin was claiming U. S. threatened hun with invasion. 
An incompetent with power is a dangerous condition. It is time for the international c o m ­ munity to deal with Amin. At least, reported s la u g h te r of thousands of persons should be investigated. That is a proper job for the I 
N. 
Protection of 25o Americans there in a proper job for Presi­ dent Carter 

There might have to be an­ other Entebbe, lf there is. Amin h,is to be deposed for good. 
Ethics co d e a nasty business 

U. S. Rep. Dav id ( >bev, D- 
Wis., is entitled to public c o m ­ mendation for being tough with a mean job. 
Ile in chairman of the House com m ittee that has sent out a bill to require his colleagues lo report outside unearned income and other a s p e c t s of e t h ic a l conduct. 
Ile said of the work. “ It s the most distasteful, unpleasant job iii the world. I came here to be a 

 legislator, not a judge of other m e m b ers of Congress. I don't enjoy making myself unpopular with people.” 
B ecause his job m ade him unpopular iii C ongress show s 
Hie need for doing it 
Now tile heat is on the m em bers to a c ­ cept the rules without crippling a m e n d m e n t. That is the other part of the bargain in the pay raise m e m b e r s have alrea d y accepted 

Cleansing carrot 

Sir: Recently a woman asked Dr. 
Thosteson about carrot juice used as a cleanser. 
His reply ridiculed it as having no value, and called it quackery. Misuse of X-ray also is a form of q u ack ­ ery . 
Needle therapy comes in this c a te ­ gory, but 
I Inisi1 in authority ask you to sign a statement that relieves them of liability for tin shots. I'his is incredible and cannot be taken for granted. 
Good health is found by sound eating aud drinking habits. 
'Hie orthomolecular science of r e a ­ listic nutrition eventually and inevita­ bly will be accepted by the majority of medical practitioners. 
My experience with carrot juice is when I drink a glass there is a cle a n s­ ing action within an hour, aud it also acts as a diuretic. 
A rthur B rim ! 

( 'ongrussional pay criticized 

Sir. How man y of us know salaried govern m ent employes — federal, state o r lo cal — w h o h a v e r e c e i v e d p a y raises of mor e than $27,oo(1 i ii the past eight years? Tile answer: We all do. 
In JOHS, our elected c o n g re s sm e n were paul $4o,ooo yearly. That year. our cong ressm en voted themselves a pay raise of 42 per cent, an increase of 
$12,5oo yea rly . so that i ii B*H9 they were paid $42,5oo 
In 1**75 Congress voted themselves a pay raise of 5 per cent which becam e effective in O c to b e r 1o75

Keep record on our judges 

Sir: Our home was burglarized se­ veral weeks ago in daylight hours. We 
.were im press ed by the thorough in­ vestigation by the San Antonio Police 
Department. Our police a re doing a magnificent job in att emptin g to halt this rash of burglarie s that have been occurring. 

In talking with officers. I was horri­ fied to learn that whe n the police apprehen d the suspect, even with an airtight ease, that the suspect n o rm a l­ ly will be turne d loose on bail by the judge. I heard of one ease where tin* suspect was a rr ested for the ninth time w itll fingerprints at the scene, etc., yet the judge turned him loose on the s a m e bail bond that he had been freed on in 

 his eighth arre st. Nine cases pending, but how m any b urglaries had he com ­ m itted for which the police w ere u n ­ a b le to m a k e a e a s e ? P e r h a p s five tim es that num ber! 

Are ta x p ay e rs paying the ju d g e 's sa la rie s to p ro te ct th e “ r ig h ts " of these habitual crim in als or do we have the " r ig h t” to be protected from this crim inal elem ent? We should expect that the judges work to see justice done 
— to the w rongdoer and to the v ictim. 

It is m y u nd erstand ing that Chief 
P eters is ala rm e d about the citizenry a rm in g th em se lv es to protect th eir homes. I’m certain they are. Any re d ­ blooded A m erican is going to fight to protect what is his. U nfortunately the citizenry is not aw are of what is u n ­ doubtedly the prim e cause: the* release of apprehended w rongdoers to go out and steal again, again, and again. 

It i s tim e for the press and the TV to m ake the citizens aw are of what is happening. T hese are elected officials turning these crim in als loose to prey on us. Are we asking too m uch to be protected from the d epredatio ns of this crim inal elem ent? No! It i s our God given right as taxpaying citizens to expect this! 

It would be helpful if the m edia could m ake public the daily " tra c k re co rd ” of these judges.

This will be m ad e clear. Young says, here at the United Nations.

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday February 26 I 9 7 7 

These patients are snaking ii 

When she walks into the doc­ tor’s office at the San Antonio 
State Hospital. Clara looks like a matron you'd see at the Garden 
Club tea on Thursdays. 
Hor red-lacquered fin g e rn a ils si­ lently fuss with the white heads around her neck, the beads accenting an ex­ pensive aqua pantsuit. 
I t ’s probably not the hospital that makes her nervous. She’s been a pa­ tient here before. She's a recovering alcoholic. 
So is K e r m it. U n lik e C la r a , the 
26-year-old man is still a patient in the state hospital’s detoxification center the day of the interview. 
Like Ringo 

Walking into the windowed doctor’s office, he smiles amiably. Sits down. 
His big eyes slope down at the.outside edge — like Hinge Starr's. 
The first awkward question: Does he like the hospital’s contract program for alcoholics? 
" Y e a h .” lie says agreeably. “ I don’t believe everything I hear.” 
W ha t m a ke s h im w ant to q u it drinkingo “ Everything.” he says and laughs. It ’s a social laugh. Hut it’s pleasant. 
(lazing at the far wall. K erm it ex­ plains he began to seriously think of giv ing up alcohol two years ago. 
Lost everything 

“ I got booted out of the arm y for alcohol. I lost my family. I lost ever­ ything I had in my life. I ve made good money and lost it. 
“ You get to the point where you’re drinking up everything.” he continues pulling a cigarette package from his shirt pocket. “ You think it's bad when you lost your wife, but you’ve still got your car and money. Then you lose them .”

He h alf-la u g h s, but h e ’s ju d g in g himself harshly. 
He ll say that’s part of the self-de­ fea tin g way alcoholics often view themselves. 

Stealing from mom 

“ You know, you really get insane w hen you’re drinking.” Insane? “ Yeah, like stealing credit cards from your mother." 
That creates remorse, guilt — self pity. An incredible mental burden. 
It s lit e r a lly enough to d riv e so­ meone back to the bottle. 
Kermit admitted himself to the state hospital’s alcohol unit for the firs! time last October. 
He did it after a binge. “ I got drunk watching a football game. Tile next thing I know I ’m going on a plane to 
Las Vegas. 

Downhill 

“ I knew I wasn't getting any saner.” 
He looks at the wall when lie s talk­ ing. He worries he’s not expressing himself well enough. He pulls out an­ other cigarette. 
“ I ’m fighting (alcoholism) as hard as I can now.” 
“ T h e re ’s a lot of people out there who could just flat die drinking. They don't know . . . I know . . . . I have a 

 c h o i c e . . . ” 
Clara knows about the choice She’s been there. In many ways, an alcoholic is always there. They live from day to day. 
Ex-zombie 
Only one out of 33 alcoholics quit drinking to the extent Clara has, she explains. 
She spent two terms in this hospital d rying out and starting a recovery program. She had to be admitted both times by her kids. “ I was a zombie.” 
She hasn’t had a drink in m o n t h s now, and she’s not having one today. “ I feel verv much alive. Right now it s 

 spring. I feel like I just want to get out there and r e a lly l i v e , ’ ’ says tile dark-eyed woman, staring seriously at the grassy slopes outside the window 
"I feel like I started liv ing about four weeks after I was iii the hospital (last s u m m e r). I ’m an entirely different person now.” 
Getting free 

“ I don’t have to do things because somebody said I had to do it. Now, I do things I want to do,” she says. 
She explains she started d rink in g heavily in the late '6os. Before that, sin' was only a social drinker. 
Why did sin' drink? “ I don’t know.” 

 she said “ I ask myself." 
"I guess I had to have an outlet " 
Her husband was sil k for it) years, she says She had to take care of him and support the family. 
But it was more than that. 
•'I felt like I was missing something if I couldn’t drink with a group,” she adds, explaining she was active in ci- v ic groups 
Strict fam ily 

She looks out at the window again. ” 1 came from a Polish fam ily, and you know, thew were verv strict. 
“ If you were a woman, you lived a different life You didn t live to please yourself. You lived to please the man you m a rrie d and then you lived for your kids.” 
Since last summer, it s been differ­ ent 
She’s saying what she wants, do­ ing what she wants. And part id’ what she wants is to work with the people at the hospital and at AA 
Why? 
“ It s hard to explain — I ’m so happy now 
It s something inside me and I want to give some of this to other peo­ ple.

African leader urges fighting 

L O M E . Togo (A P ) - 
A rm ed struggle is the only recourse for the lib e ra tio n of southern 
A fr ic a , the s e c re ta ry - general of the Organiza­ tion for African Unity has told the A fric an m in is ­ terial council. 
In presenting a report un his activities, Secre- t a ry -Genera I 
W illiam 
Eketi said, “ A peaceful means for transfer of power to the Zimbabwe 
(Rhodesian) people is blocked." 
‘ ‘ In the present c i r ­ cumstances.” he added, 
“ negotiations can only lead to concessions which would be the equivalent of com prom ises or the betra ya l of the a s p ir a ­ tions of the Z im b a b w e people.” Intensification of the armed fight is the only m eans for a real tra n s fe r of pow er, he said. 
Z im b a b w e is the /A- frican name for Rhode­ sia. 
Limited action 
E k e ti also said the lib eration of Rhodesia would be only a limited action unless it prepares the liberation of South 
Africa. 
E k e ti called Angola. 
Botswana. Mozambique, 
T a n za n ia and Z a m b ia front line nations in the liberation struggle and paid trib u te to 
“ the sacrifices they make and the dangers to which they expose them selves because of their support for the different lib e ra ­ tion movements.” 
Several of those coun­ tries provide bases from which black nationalist guerrillas carry on their war against Rhodesia's white m inority gov ern ­ ment. 
Congress is eligible for another pay hike 

 w a s h i n g t o n s t a r s e r v ic e 

W ASHING TON - The 
535 m e m b e r s of C on­ gress. who just received a 112.9oo-a-year salary increase, are eligible for another pay raise in just seven months. It is called a cost-of-living a d ju s t­ ment. 
The exact amount of the increase has nut been set. but two outraged freshmen congressmen 
— one a Democrat, the other a Republican — fi­ gure that the new pay boost may be somewhere between 
$2,8oo and 
$3.7oo*a-year 
By their figuring, the new annual salaries of congressmen would be so m e w he re between 
$8(i,3oo and $81,2oo a year. And like the recent pay inc re ase re c o m ­ mended by a special fe­ deral com m ission, the congressmen can pocket the money without hav­ ing to embarrass them ­ selves by taking a vote on it. 
Autom atic 
Reps. Edward .1. Mar- key, D .-M ass.. and Hal 
Sawyer, R -M ich , have separately introduced le­ gislation to kill the auto­ m a tic cost-o f-liv in g in ­ creases for congressmen and senators whose sa­ laries just leaped from 
$44,8oo lo $57,5oo a year. 

.I initial t ta la r ie » o f (.oh p r e nm en would he in ex ceint o f $(*o,ooo 

T he new pay scale would take effect auto­ m atically in October — unless Congress votes to reject it — because con­ gressm en com e u nd er the automatic cost-of-liv* mg increases covering all federal employes under the so-called ( omparabi- 
Ii tv Act. it w asn’t always that way. When the act was adopted in 
19717 m e m b e rs of Congress were not covered. But in 
August 
1975. congress­ men added themselves, federal judges, and the ve ry top level fe d e ra l executives to the law, 

Political poison 

Although congressmen su p p o rtin g the 28 per cent salary increase that took effect last Sunday have been arguing that it was deserved, in p art, because they hail r e ­ ceived no pay ra is e in eight years, Congress did receive one cost of living increase — i i i 1975. At that time. congressional salaries went up by 5 per cent, fro m $42,5oo to 
$44,8oo, effective Oct. I, 
1975. 
Allot lier inc re a s e of 
4.83 per cent was 

 scheduled for last 
October — one m onth before the general elec­ tion. Quick to recognize they were playing with political poison, however. 
Congress found a way to cancel it. 
W hen the le g is la tiv e appropriations bill came up in the House last Sep­ tember, Reps. Morris K. 
U d a ll, 
D - A r iz ., and 
George E. Shipley. O -lll.. sponsored an a m e n d ­ ment, which was adopt­ ed, barring the use of any funds in the congressional money bill lo pay the congressional cost-of-living increase, lf the p o litic a l heat builds up. the same could lie engineered this year, although so far there has been no talk of doing so. 
That opportunity w ill come when the annual co n gressional fu n d in g bill comes up for a vote or when Hie legislators vote themselves the ad­ ditional money needed to cover last 
S u n d a y ’s 
$12,9oo inc re ase . C u r ­ rently, there are just en­ ough congressional sa­ lary funds to cover the 28 per cent raise through 
Aug. I,

Sawyer says his fo re­ cast of a potential $3,7oo pay raise was based on 
White House budgeting 
“ President C arter has earm arked enough m on­ ey in his proposed federal budget to give members of Congress a 8.5 per cent pay raise this October."

Texas history ows from a river bank town 

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday February 26 1977 

As with people — strange are the ways in which immortality comes to places. 
The most historic spot i i i Texas is a little community on the banks of the 
Brazos River between Brenham and 
Navasota. 
Were it not for a park there, the little community today would almost be a ghost town. 
But the place will live as lout? as there is a Texas because a small group of men — sparked bv the town’s m e r­ chants — HI years ago took on what we today would call a c h a m b e r of co m ­ merce project. 
They pledged t h e m s e l v e s 'to raise 
SITO to pay for three months rent on a little wooden building where the pro­ posed Constitu tional Convention of 
Texas could be held. 

Gen Santa Anna is believed to have been the ow ner of this b eau tifu l walking stick. It is carved with the historic eagle and serpent symbols of 
M e x ic o . D is p la y in g the cane is 
Sherry Hum phreys, curator of the 
Star of the Republic of Texas M u­ seum at Washington-on-the-Brazos. 

The building —still un co m p leted when the rent-free offer was m a d e delegates — was only .'III feet by 2o feet. 
But it was one of only two fram e buildings in town. All o th ers w ere made of logs. 
And it was the only building in town with a wooden floor. All others had just dirt floors. 
But this chandler of commerce-type offer of the town's boosters was a c ­ cepted and delegates met there. Of course there were other reasons for the choice but the im itatio n could well have tipped the scales. 
And so i m m o rt a lit y c a m e to Wa- shington-on-the Brazos when conven­ tion delegates on March 2. IKM. unan­ imously declared Texas an indepen­ dent nation. 
Bonnie and I went lo Washington- on-the-Brazos last weekend. 
And as M arch 2 a p p ro a c h e d this year, spring was arriving fitfully as it must have been in 1836. 
Muddy Brazos 
We stood on the banks of tin' Brazos 
River down at tin' foot of the hill on top of which stood the building where the 
Texas Declaration of Independence was passed. The river ran wide and muddy. 
The stark, gray pecan trees on its banks were still in the sleep of winter. 
But the willows oil the far bank were sta rtin g to tu rn the red of (‘artiest spring. 
The grass was beginning to green the hillside and the tiny bluets were r ising fro m little p a t c h e s of wild clover. 
Historians today know m ore about that 1836 spring because of the re m a r ­ kable diary of Col William Fairfax ti ray. 
(iray. so p ro m in e n t that Gen. La 
Fayette had once been bis dinner guest 

I m m o r ta lity c a m e to l l ash in g to n -o n -th e-llra zos ivhea convention delegates on March 2, un­ a nim ously declared Texas ail independent nation 

 other place. Residents elected four — 
Navarro. Ruiz, Juan Seguin and Mi­ guel Arciniega, though Seguin and 
Arciniega did not attend. And soldiers stationed at the Alamo elected Samuel 
A. Maverick and Jesse B. Badgett. 
Under the date of March I. 1836. 
Gray's diary noted: 
“ S esterday was a warm day and at bedtime I found it necessary to throw off some clothes. 
“ In the night, till' wind sprung up from the north and blew a gale. a c ­ companied by lightning, thunder, rain and hail and it became very cold. . . 
“ N o tw i t h s t a n d i n g th e n o r t h e r , members of the convention met today 

 i i i an unfinished house without doors or windows . . . cotton cloth was stretched across the windows. “ 
Duplicate 
A duplicate of the little convention hull has been erected on its site. When 
Bonnie and I stepped into the little building, we were moved at the sight of u n fin ish e d cotto n cloth s t r e t c h e d across the windows as in the days of long ago. 
The present building is air-condi­ 

 tioned and gas-heated. 
The 6o-acre park now has the Star of the Republic of Texas Museum, built in the shape of a star — the restored 
Anson Jones home, an auditorium and ampitheater and the superintendent’s office and residence. 
There is a fine picnic area down bv the river lint no campground. 
Constitution 
Bonnie and I first visited the m u ­ seum At its entrance is the statue of 
George <’. Childress. Childress was chairman of tin* committee to draft the declaration of independence and is generally credited with being its auth­ or 
Childress, a lawyer aud newspaper editor in Nashv ille. Teiin., had been i i i 
Texas less than two months. 
Tin* handwritten declaration signed by 52 persons on March 3 — seven signed later — was rushed to San Fe­ lipe de Austin to be printed. 
The printer left out the names of two signers. 
Ironically one was the author. Chil­ dress. The other was the impresario. 
Sterling C. Robertson, who was proba­ 

 bly the most influential Texan ot the day. 
The printer made an abject apology. 
Ile said all he could offer as a reason was ii “ was executed iii too much haste and principally done at night.*' 
How thrilled we wen* to see one of the few r e m a i n i n g copies of that broadside iii the museum. 
The o r i g i n a l hand-written, signed document was lost f o r many years. In 
I HHH it was f o u n d bv chance i i i the files of the U.S. State Department i i i Wa 

S h i o c t o n . It had gone unnoticed 66 years 
Wharton 
Author L. \V Kemp reports on the back of the document someone — still unknown — had written, “ Left at the 
Department el State May 28. 1836 by 
Mr Wharton The original " Wharton was William ll. Wharton, first am b as­ sador to the I S. from the Republic of 
Texas 
After discovery, the document was returned to the governor of Texas It is now on exhibit at the Lorenzo de Za­ vala Library and Archives at lith aud 
San Jacinto in Austin. 
T h e late L. W 
K e m p — w hom 
Bonnie and I knew i i i Houston — did a r e m a r k a b l e job of r e s e a r c h i n g tin* lives of the r>fl signers. His book was published in RHT 
Only 16 of the signers had been i i i 
Texas as m uch as six years. Kemp 

 wrote 
“ \ irginia was the birthplace ol 12 signers North Carolina gave birth to 
16. Tennessee to nine, Kentucky to six and Cieorgia to four 
“ F our were British subjects, one each i i i Bogland, Ireland, Scotland arid 
Canada. South Carolina and Pennsyl­ vania each furnished three 
“ Three were native of Mexico, two of whom were born i i i Texas (Navarro and Ruiz) New York was the birth­ place of two sig ners and M a ssa c h u ­ setts, Mississippi and New Jersey one each." 
Many of the signers had moved from their birthplace prior to com ing to 
T ex a s T h ir te e n s i g n e r s m oved to 
Texas from Tennessee and eight from 
Alabama

Just inside the entrance is a large painting depicting the* scene inside the intl** building when the declaration was read to the delegates. 
Painted by Charles and Fanny Nor­ m an, it is on loan from Mrs. Artic

 back in Yirgina. was not a delegate but he was at the convention. 
Earlier he had been more crowded but in time he and four room m a tes shared a small carpenter’s shop. Two of this roommates were delegates from 
Bexar — Jose Antonio Navarro and 
Col. Francisco Ruiz. 
More delegates were elected to the convention from Bexar than from any 

This was the way it was — in I 836. Two boys look with interest on this large painting at the entrance to the museum at Washington-on-the-Brazos state park. The scene is the reading of the Texas Declaration of 
Independence on March 2, I 836. The little building where the historic meeting was held was only 3o feet by 2o feet.

NEW YORK (A P) — A modest upturn in some bine chip issues failed to pull the stock market out of its recent downward trend Friday. 
The Dow Jones average of 3o industrial stocks posted a .83 gain to 
933.43, trimming its loss for the week to 6.81 points. 
But Dow Jones’ tran­ sportation and utility averages both declined, and losers outnumbered gainers by about an 8-5 margin on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
Big Board volume, which has been dwin­ dling since the middle of 
February, touched a new early-1977 low of 17.61 million shares, down from 19.73 million on 
Thursday. 
Nationwide turnover in 
NYSE-listed issues, in­ cluding trades in those stocks on regional ex­ changes and in the over- the-counter market, came to 2o.74 million shares. 
Traders seemed to be looking cautiously for bargains and covering previous short sales in a few of the big-name blue chips. 
Interest 

But analysts said the rest of tho market con­ tinued to suffer from concern over rising in­ terest rates and fears of a resurgence of inflation. 
All this week W all 
Street appeared to have taken its cue from Arthur 
Burns, chairman of the 
Federal Reserve Board, who asserted Wednesday that the prospect of ex­ panded government spending had raised in­ flation fears and dam­ pened confidence among business executives. 
Standard & Poor’s in­ dex of 4oo industrials dipped 
OH to 11o.66, and 
SlSxI' s 5oo-stock compo­ site index was down .12 at 
99.48. 
Blue chips 

Blue chips recording gains included Eastman 
Kodak, up l ni at 74:ih; 
Procter & (lambie, ahead at 82*si General Mo­ tors, up ’n at 7o, and 
Ford Moto.. i , higher at 
56r<i. 
Late til the day Ford raised its forecast of in­ dustry car sales for the year. 
Glamor stocks were mixed, with Xerox up at 5o12 and Texas I n ­ struments ahead 11 j at 
81'^ while Minnesota 
Mining & Manufacturing dropped to S P * and 
IBM was unchanged at 
275*2. 
IBM rose sharply early in the week when the company offered to buy 4 million of its shares for 
.$28o apiece. 
Sony, the day’s most active issue, added ** to 
9'n. 
Few stocks made any sharp moves oil a quiet day for business and fin­ ancial news. 
One exception was 
Houston Oil A Minerals. the most active Am er­ ican Stock Exchange is­ sue. which fell 3>j to 
44' •/. 
The company reported that its fourth-quarter 

 earnings rose from 32 to 
67 cents a share. But traders who had bid the stock up very sharply in recent months evidently had been expecting an even stronger showing. 
The N YSE’s composite 

 index gave up .o8 to 54.o9. 
In other markets, the 
Amex market value in­ dex fell .57 to 11o.58, while the NASDAQ com­ posite index of over-the- counter stool s rose .o6 to 
34.9o. 
Coffee goes 
O near $3 top 

The bull move in coffee occupied a lim elight again this week as Latin 
American producers again took measures to preserve their rapidly dwindling exportable supplies and hiked their export taxes and prices for. in some cases, the third time this year. 
While try tug to realign themselves with the higher level of producer prices in three successive lim it moves, futures were further incited to learn that the leading 
U.S. coffee roaster was in 
Brazil paying up to $2.91 per pound for as much as 
2oo.OOO bags of green coffee with futures fair behind at around $2.6o per pound. 
The $2.91 per pound price which this promin­ ent price leader paid for unroasted, unrefined and un packaged coffee of average quality sur­ passes what many consumers across the 
U.S. are currently paying in supermarkets for

 roasted ground coffee in one pound cans. 
On top of all this. a rumor cropped up this week that due to the ra­ pid depletion in her scarce coffee supplies. 
Brazil might be forced to curtail her exports as of 
July I. 
While this alternative would appear rather ex­ treme, this major Latin 
American coffee pro­ ducer will probably be forced to restrict exports,

Son Antonio EXPRES S -N E W S — Saturday February 2 6 1977 
BIRTHPLACE 

Continued from Page IB 

 of the first things Mrs. Humphreys showed us — a caned wooden walking stick. 
“ This is believed to be a walking stick once used by Gen. Santa Anna.'' 
Mrs. Humphreys said. 
The beautiful cane is caned ult Ii the symbolic eagle and serpent of Mexico. 
There are two gold bands in grooves cut near the handle. An unverified re­ port s a y s these were the wedding rings of Santa Anna’s mother and father. 
Then Mrs. Humphreys brought out a silver dagger. It reportedly was tin* gift of a New York bank president to 
Gen Santa Anna when the general made a trip there in connection with his country's finances. 
Exhibit coming 
Mrs Humphreys is preparing a ma­ jor exhibit on the signers. It will be form ally opened at the annual pro­ gram at the state park March H. 
The exhibit and Kemp's book make it plain even the lesser-known signers had careers of unusual interest. 
Take M 
B 
Menard, who laid out 
<ralveston. He was a fur trapper and an 
Indian trader, closely associated with the Indians Ile had been a Shawnee chief in the White River country i i i 
Arkansas 
Richard Hills, convention president, had been on the Alabama Supreme 
Court 
He had another unusual dis. 
Ruction — an elected delegate to the constitutional conventions of Alabama, 
Arkansas and Texas. 
Kills was a delegate from Pecan 
Point up on the Red River. It seems lik e ly all five delegates from Pecan 
Point lived in Ar kansas 
A tragic thing happened to delegate 
Jesse Grimes. While he was attending the convention his IK-year-old son was killed al the Alamo. 
William Carroll Crawford, a relative of one of the signers of the K S. De­ claratio n of Independence, was a 
Methodist minister Ile was the last of the signers of the Texas declaration lo die — Sept lf. I SMY 
Influential 
One of the most influential members ut the convention was Knreii/n de Za­ vala Gray describer! lulu as “ the most interesting man i i i T e x a s “ He was elected vier' president ot the republic w it bout opjwisit ion 
In the museum is a note lie wrote recommending the convention name an interpreter lo report Spanish It was done 
De Zavala was horn in the Yucatan. 

T o w n w ill b o r e b u ilt 

Washington on the-Brazos will he 

 rebuilt as ii was in IX3H when the 
Texas Declaration ot Independence was signed 

A little more than MMI acres where 

 the original town was located have been acquired bv the stale ’ lie land a d jo in s the W ashington on the Bi a 
/os State Park 

The Texas Handbook reports 

 there were about ail buildings in the town in ISIK Only two were frame buildings All the others were built of logs — and some were little more than lean ins. 

The Je s s e Jo n e s Foundation and 

 the George and Nunc Butler I ami­ dation are providing tile research to determine just what the town was when the declaration of indepen- di lice was signed 

He had been a member o f R h * Spanish congress in M adrid, governor of a 
Mexican state and Mexican ambassa­ dor to France. 
De Zavala died in the fall following the convention — had he lived it is finite possible the history of Texas and 
Mexico might be far different today. 
In the exhibit arc some documents signed by Jo se Antonio N avarro. 
Among other distinctions, Nav arro was elected to the Mexican C ongress, the 
Congress of tin* Republic of Texas and then was a Texas state senator. 
Ruiz had a long military career in­ cluding high p o s ts in the Mexican army And no one had a more colorful and distinguished public career than 
Samuel Maveric k. 
Beautiful home 

From the museum. Bonnie and I went to the home of Anson Jones, moved from its original site about, three miles to I In* west and restored 
The beauty of the white home matches the beauty of the site atop a hill sloping gently down to tin- river. 
Jones was a doctor and his office is ut

If the week s weather holds out. San Antonians will be heading for the hills this weekend—and a taste of Texas 
Hill Country cooking. 

 beans and a side dish of guacamole and a delicious puffed taco. 

We shared a piece of apple pie for dessert that did not seem up to the quality of the rest of the meal 

But the coffee was good and hot. and our friendly waitress made us feel so at home that the food almost became secondary. 
Our take-home barbeque was $3.all a pound and quite good We bought ribs, sausages and sliced beef for our Sun- da\ night feast 
Barbeque plates are $2.95. or part it's of sin can h a\e the same thing for a total of $17.7o— including refills within limitations

Manager lack Bagel took us on a tour upstairs where the courtroom is being converted to a ballroom (perfect for wedding receptions and live-m usie dances) and a couple of sm aller rooms to be used for private dinner parties 
Mrs Roberts' plants and old brass chandeliers decorate the downstairs dining rooms that are already open We ate our dinner in one that opens into the barroom with furnishings out of an old 
Blanco drug store.

The menu—featuring grilled steaks. shrimp and Mexican food—is written on a blackboard posted outside the dining room. 
I had a T-bone steak at $3.95. It was a generous portion of m eat, though I would have preferred something cut thicker and cooked ox cr charcoal 

The meal started with a beauty of a sa lad se rv e d w ith g a rlic k y toast rounds And the price included wide- cut fried potatoes and refried beans 
My husbands Tampiquena was the same price and included the restaur­ ant’s "pee wee” size steak along with servings of en ch ilad as and refried

What to eat /fp 

Bv Jane l lbrieh 
( S g g 
I haven’t had a chance to check out all the interesting Hill Country eating places I'm hearing about, but I did discover one recently that has a Texas historical m arker' 
T he C o u rth o u se in B lanco w as opened as a steak-and-potatoes re s ­ taurant four months ago by the owners of Salt Lick in Driftwood and Salt Lick, 
Too in Blanco. 
The building was constructed in 188H and used as a courthouse until the county seat was moved in 18911 
Iii the meantime, it has served as a hospital, bank. school and most re- centlv as a museum 

 watching the sun go down while wait­ ing in line outside this restaurant in a mesquite-studded ranehland setting. 
A homemade ice cream parlor and pie shop will open up adjacent to it soon for the sum m er season 
The Blanco version has a sim ilar form at hut a com pletely different s e ttin g —the s id e y a rd of th e old courthouse building. 
Stopping in Blanco a few pretty Sa­ turdays back. my husband and I found ourselves try in g to m ake a choice between The Courthouse and Salt Lick, 
Too 
Not wanting to miss anything, we decided to have dinner al the steak- house and pick tip barbeque to take home. 
Restoration 
The Courthouse is a square stone building. Mr. and Mrs Thurm an Rob­ erts and their son, Scott are restoring the interior 

(.curial store 

I cheeked in with Scott Roberts this w (‘ck to see if any major changes had taken place Ile reports a seafood plat­ ter and frog legs w ill be added in The 
Courthouse menu soon 

And, he will open a general store across the street in about a mouth. 
Another good reason to go back! 

I had been interested in Salt Lick, 
Too —having happy memories of eat­ ing family-style barbeque at the Salt 
Lick in Driftwood. 
Located in a dry precinct. Salt Lick is a favorite with Austinites who don’t mind loading up an ice chest of beer and making the drive—in exchange for 

PAUL SC H N ELLE T W O -P A R T PRINT DRESS 
Darlene team s it with Italian silk gabardine blazer 
Fashionable investments 

Carol’s impeccably-tailored suit is an example of the contemporary classic look of Ernst Strauss and 
Schnell Sports. 
The fine detailing in her navy. 
Italian silk g a b a r d i n e jack et team ed with a sim ple w alking skirt and open white shirt, is de­ signer Paul Schnell’s tradem ark 
And it is also a part of the high quality that put 
Schnell Sport- s u its iii th e $39o to $4oo p ric e range. 
“ They are (the clothes) for the more affluent, the more sophisti­ cated woman,” admits Scott 
"They are investment clothes.” 
These investment clothes for a woman at ain age can be put-to­ gether to create a thousand looks for all occasions. 
Blazer 
C arol say s sh e ta k e s P au l 
S e h n e lls two-part d ress iii red print and learns it with the dou­ ble-breasted blazer for a different look. 
The two-part dress is important for spring and sum m er. "Im p o rt­ ed cottons, silk poplins and silk pongee in softly-pleated skirts and shirts are in this collection.” Scott says. 
Many are teamed with the Ul­ trasuede jacket— a blazer with patch sleeves or a new scissor-cut jacket with a “ V" cut out at the bottom of the front. 
Teaming “ U ltras" with com pa­ tible fabrics is another success story at Schnell Sports. Colors are m atched perfectly in gabardine skirts and pants. 
I 

T his fall the new U ltrasu ed e colors will In* celadon— an Orien­ tal blue-green, eggplant, rose­ wood. and 
Scott's 
"sleeper- color,” French tan. 

The French tan is a guaranteed winner and will be done iii a terri­ fic blouson jacket. 

Bv NANCY SCOTT JONES 

In avantp-garde Califor­ nia, contemporary counts— in lifestyle and in fashion. 
Trendy means status up and down Highway One. 
But Paul Scott, president, and 
P a u l S ch n ell, d e s ig n e r, of the w ell-estab lish ed E rn st S tra u ss and Schnell Sports fashion house have accom plished the im p o ssi­ ble. 
They have succeeded in making the classics trendy— not trendy, trendy, but eontemporurv trendy.

Charles V Room at the St. Anthony

Ultrasuede in black for the first time. 
The black dye has finally been perfected in tin* five short year* 
Ultrasuede has been the num ber one fabric of fashion. 
“ T h e re is no s e c o n d ,” Scott says. 
With him was his wife Carol, a slender, soft Iv-tan blonde wearing 
Schnell Sports, of course. 
Carol, a native of Houston, met 
Scott when she was modeling for his collection. They have been m arried two years. 
“ She still models for me, but now sin* charges me more for her work,” laughs Scott. 

The tunneled-blouson jacket will have a detachable Norwegian fox color, dyed to m atch the French tan. 

And the blouson also will come in black U ltrasuede. With solid black p ants it m a k es a perfect cocktail suit. 

Scott says they will add softer touches to their evening wear for full, Velvety jackets and taffeta skirts will highlight the glittering night clothes

Toudouze Furniture will hold a mini-seminar on interior decorating from 7 to !) p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday at the 
Toudouze store on 
Broadway. 

The seminar will be conducted by .John Rohre 
Angerstein, instructor of interior design at St. 
Mary's University. 

A full week has been given in salute to local 
Parent-Teacher groups. A letter was received from 
Mrs. B. R. Heath after she had read last Sunday’s feature and the daily stories in the Express. 
Here is her letter, which we feel our readers would like to share. — Lois Haase 

San Antonio Express. 

This may be a bit presump­ tuous writing a letter about the 
PTA celebration but I have al­ ways been a great believer in the good of this organization and at one time was working with Jefferson. Washington 
Irving and Crockett PTAs. 

My mother, Mrs. Alice Per­ rin. with Mrs. A. H. Cad- uallader and Mrs. Frank Allen and others that I do not re­ member. were the organizers of the Crockett PTA. 
It seems as though I re­ member a Mrs. M cA llister coming to help them to organ­ ize. 
The school at that time only had four grades. The principal was Miss Anna Shaefer and my aunt. Miss Annie Perrin was a teacher there. 

I believe the first achieve­ ment they made was a drinking fountain established in the yard. Before this, water buck­ ets were placed in the win­ dows with a dipper in each bucket and we all drank from that same dipper. 

These first ladies accomplished many other benefits for the children. 

I am almost SB years old but I have always been interested. In 
1932 to 1936, I was president of 
Washington 
Irving Ju n io r 
School PTA. 
Before I married and had children in the schools. I was a teacher in Bowie and No. 21 school and had been a substi­ tute for six weeks at Crockett 
School, whose principal at that time was Mr. Herman Hirsch. 

I wish to join in your salute as I have great-grandchildren in the schools at this time. 

Respectfully, 
Mrs. B. Ii. Heath 
(former Mamie Perrin) 

The first class will fo­ cus on how to prepare a room using color coor­ dination and the selection of wall and floor cover­ ings. The final session will look at the selection of furniture and room ar­ rangements. . 

The seminar is open to the public for a Sa fee.

Look who came to dinner! 

Churchill All-State football player David Darr turns his fancy to 
Brenda Mergele, a Churchill sophomore. She s wearing a tri­ ple-tiered eyelet prom dress which she will model at 7 p.m. 
Monday during the Wendy Ward graduation at Montgomery 
Ward in Windsor Park. Friday is the enrollment deadline for new 
Wendy Ward classes in all three stores. 

A woman with an eye for attractive men studied P re si­ dent Carter from a respectahie d ist a nee at his first state din­ ner and then com­ mented: 
“ You know he looks so much sexier in black tie than a cardigan and jeans you wonder why he doesn’t like dressing up.” 
Sho had a point. The man who may have started a national trend lor sweaters and casual attire looked younger, handsomer and more vi­ gorous in a tuxedo that fit him to a T. T h e re ’s som ething to that old saying, “ clothes make the man.” 
But the .Jimmy Carters are unpredictable and are not going to be bound by the old rules. Having 
9-year-old Am y at the formal state dinner for the Lopez Portillos and at the table with the two presidents and two first ladies was proof of that 
Not since 
.Jim m y 
Carter adopted the motto 
“ Speak soft Iv and carry a big Val-Pak.” has anyth­ ing caused so many comments on the capital circuit, .lust about every other person at the Mex­ ican embassy reception spoke about it. 
Carter supporters look pained when the subject comes up “ I wouldn’t allow my children to stav 

Giving up pet was right 

Dear Ann Landers: 

Please tell me I did tile right thing. I feel so guilty. 
At the same time, warn your readers to think twice before they get a pet for a child who is too young to treat him pro­ perly. 
I love animals and have' alw as s wanted a dog. Hut 
I decided not to get one until our children were old enough to handle the responsibility. Unfortun­ ately. a friend surprised us with a puppy. He was 

 so cute we just had to take him. 
Our son is three years old. He doesn’t know a puppy is a living thing that digs, bites, chews, barks, cries and should not be squeezed hard or pulled by the tail or ears. 
I soon discovered the boy could not be trusted alone with the puppy and decided the animal would be better off with the 
SIM A. J hoped another family would adopt him. 
I cried when I left him there. 

W henever I think of that sweet little pet. I get a lump in my throat. 
Please tell me I did the right thing, Ann 
— 

 reeling (.iiiltv 

Dear Friend: You did 
Now. forget it. On the plus side, your letter gives me an opportunity to remind my readers not to buy or accept pots as gifts, unless someone in the family is prepared to care for them properly and protect them against tin* innocent cruelty of young children.

Said tin* wife of a I S official who attended the dinner. “ I have never had a child of mine at a formal dinner. This ad­ m inistration isn't like anything we have ever had before. 
“ When my kills got to lie 14 and could carry on a fairly intelligent con­ versation. I would incor­ porate them ." Although 
Amy had some conversa­ tion with the wife of 
Mexico’s foreign m inis­ ter whom she sat beside, she also read the book she brought with her. 
Another official dinner guest remarked the next day. 
“ I was surprised w hen Amy came in and I was p a rtic u la rly surprised when she sat at the President’s table. Of course, tin' reading should not have been al­

“ I thought the enter­ tainment (pianist Kudolf

Peter Malatesta. who would like to call his book “ In the Lye of the 
Hurricane." lint the title isn t settled vet. has put together vignettes he has been w riting over the past 15 years. 
The vignettes cover such famous people as 
Howard Hughes, who once had a locker next to 
Peter’s uncle. Bol) Hope:

Hollywood personalities; 
Spiro Agnew and Nixon.

As Malatesta came to

President Agnew ’s sen­ ior traveling aide, few people realized he was an aide to Nixon for six months back in 
19(11 when the ex-Yice Presi­ dent had returned to Ca­ lifornia and was staying at the Ct av lord Hotel in 
Los Angeles. 
“ Ills form er Secret 
Serv ice man .Jim Colden and I were Ins aides.” said JVM or. who as a re­ sult of that experience told Agnew "when lit' of­ fered nit' a job anil asked how I felt about Nixon, I said, ‘I don’t hold him in high regard 
Iii fact, I don’t like him.’ The only tiling Agnew asked was. would I say that publicly? 
I said no." 
Andy Warhol “ was so nervous" when he saw 
President Carter in the 
Oval O ffice that “ lit1

Andy's Interview maga­ zine 
He couldn’t really un­ derstand it. said Bob at

Colacello was surprised because Andy spent two days with

Since 
I was 
14. 
I realized I was a homo­ sexual. Even though I have tried hard to over­ come it I've Jieen unable to succeed. I finally came to the conclusion that girls are not for me. 
I have fallen in love with a kid my age whose parents and mine are close friends. That s the reason I have never veil-

 lured to tell him how I feel. 
But I can’t wait any longer. My life without this kid isn’t worth liv­ ing. It has come to a point where my whole life be­ longs to him even though he doesn’t know it. 
Can you give me some advice? Please don’t tell me to try girls again. I cun t and won’t. — 
Young Lover 
Dear Y.L.: 
You need professional help — not to get straight, but to venti­ late your frustrations and anxieties. 
Pent-up emotions can create serious problems. 
(let some counseling right away. You earl tell your parents you are de­ pressed. 
II there is no therapist iii town, go to Hie school counselor or a mental health clinic — the sooner the better 

A uthority 

Dear Ann Landers: My sister-in-law considers | herself an authority on every subject. I was iii her home last Friday and silo asked me for the ’itllIi time if I would like a cup of tea 
She bus a habit of doing that and it has always I irritated me. I decided to speak up. 
I explained that a hos­ tess isn t supposed to 
ASK a guest if she wants something — she’s sup­ posed to go ahead and | serve it. 
My sister-in-law claims some (ample don’t want refreshm ents and B 's dumb to “ go ahead and serve " Who is right? —

Dear Asker: 
Tile hos­ tess who ASKS puts the burden on the guest This is impolite. The gracious hostess prepares refresh­ ments in advance and serves them.

The court voted not to allocate fe­ deral Manpower funds for the city to h ire two e m p lo y e s b e c a u s e , its m em bers said. Selma operates a speed trap. 
When the issue cam e up before the court. County Judge Blair Reeves said, 
“ No I don't think we ll give them the money. T hey a lre a d y m ak e enough from the speed trap .” 
Several San Antonio area legislators have complained in recent years of the way Selma enforces speeding laws. 

County Com. Jeff Wentworth was the only com missioner in favor of the fund allocation for the city.

“ rho truth of the m at­ ter is that art as design is one of the key factors in the production of wealth in today’s world, and can mean the difference between tile economic success or failure of a community.”

By RON W HITE 
The set is a dirty re­ minder of the souls that go unwashed during a war. The attic loft is cluttered. 
Scrapwood furniture is sprawled as though the occupants suddenly had been sucked out of the room. 
The dingy walls of the room form an enclosure that is somehow strained. 
Parts of the room are stretched beyond reality, jutting off abruptly iii what seems like an at­ tempt to redefine the li­ mited, drab reality the walls symbolize. 
The room is the perfect setting for "The Diary of 
Anne Frank.” the play based on Anne Frank's real diary detailing the attempts by her family and other .Jews to hide from the Nazis in World 
W ar II Amsterdam. 
But John Fowler’s set is not the only thing that’s well done in San 
Antonio C ollege’s pro­ duction of the play run­ ning through Saturday. 
Director Gary O. Smith has assembled a fine cast and created — if not a perfect production — a very decent show. the type that inspires new 

Review 

 respect for what college theater can do. 
Spirit 
At the center of the story is 
Anne. a 
13-year-old girl who re­ fuses to let the terror of being sought by the Nazis dim inish her youthful spirit. 
Julianne Shaw makes a sassy, playful 
Anne. 
When she sighs to the others that she is "going to be rem arkable. I ’m going to Paris,” one can see the stars twinkling in lier eyes. 
But 
Shaw 's p e rfo r­ mance is not caricature. 
She lets us watch Anne grow during tho two years the fam ilies are hiding in the attic. The character becomes a ba­ lance between a little girl dancing and playing tricks and a young wo­ man trying to summon the strength to deal with the reality of their hor­ ror-stretched existence. 

Tile other characters largely form a contrast to 
Anne. They create a pat­ tern of fear-inspired groping for their lost hu­ 

 manity. Anne’s father 
(Richard J. Silelen) re­ mains a bedrock of reason, but for the others, hiding out is a process that strips them of I heir civilization. 
The arrival of a sugar cake is occasion for bickering as each de­ fends his right to an equal share. Mark Kirk as the rotund Mr. Van 
Da an gives a good performance, letting his appetite literally over­ come him. 
Leroy 
Catel ma is equally good as a dentist who finds their confine­ ment a personal offense as lie battles the others for privacy. Lisa Pomer- antz and Linda Hayworth as Anne’s mother and sister make good con­ trasts to the others’ bickering. They’re ex­ amples of charily and goodness that also finally break down under the strain. 
Tom Parker Riekert c reates the most inter­ esting character next to 
Anne. He plays Peter, th*' 
Van Daan’s son who is lilied with adolescent shnyess, confusion and anger. Riekert success­ fully converts this adolescence into maturi­ 

 ty as P e te r’s interests move from his cat to 
Anne. 
Director Sm ith's con­ trol of the scenes and the ac tors is polished and exact. He is able to focus attention on individuals and particular parts of the room without d is ­ tracting from the reality of the other character’s activities. 
There are moments when the actine of many of the* performers has a 

 twinge of artificiality — the overly exaggerated emotion and the too hur­ ried line that one might expect of inexperienced actors. 
But these moments are surprisingly few 
The story of Anne Frank rings w itll a forceful reality. One feeds the de­ spair. the fright, aud the hopes of the characters 
Anne lived with for two years. For two hours they are once again alive'.

Amos was a shepherd and keeper of fruit trees in the village of Tekoa Keenly aware of the social inequities of the time, he condemned the oppression of the poor by tho wealthy and the powerful, the dishonest merchants, those who diverted |ustice by bribery, and the idleness and luxury of the rich 
Nature, as the rich creation of God. figured prominently in the phrasing of his prophecies "And he said. The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither." (Amos 1:12) 
Although Amos was a wrathful prophet, he maintained that those who returned to the proper faith and life could be saved "Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live, and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph " (Amos 514- 
15)

Friday it will charge 
Western drivers

The overwhelming inter­ est in this issue has created a situation iii which the lawmakers have decided to have such a hearing

The hills to be heard include one bv Rep Sa­ muel Hudson III of Dal­ las to abolish the death penalty in Texas and one by Rep. Joe Hernandez of 
San Antonio to require a five -judge Texas Court of Crim inal Appeals to have a unanimous decision before a person is killed. 
An issue as emotional as this one is seldom de­ termined by the merits of the language of the lull nor even by the merits of its ease 
Despite statements by prominent religious lead­ ers I hut the arguments against the effectiveness 

Jimmy It. ten 
Pastor, 
First Baptist Church 

 of capital punishment as a deterrent lo crime are all poppycock, the calm appraisal of all the re­ search iii the field leads to the conclusion that there is no evidence that capital punishment deters capital crime 
Evidence 
The ev idenee does not come through in any study of places where capital punishment is le­ gal as it relates to the increase or decrease of capital crime. 
The closest hint of a deterrent in capital pun­ ishment is the fact thai some burglars refuse to carry lethal weapons in their burglary lest they commit a capital offense. 
These arguments are persuasive, however, to a majority of Americans 
However, people com nutted to the spirit of 
Christ have difficulty justifying vindictiveness. 
The aim ol the gospel of Jesus Christ is always 
Hie redemption of the person who has rebelled against God. The res­ traint of destructive |mt- sons us a responsibility of law and should be uns­ 

 wervingly exercised 
It is obvious that Ibid son s bill has very little practical possibility of being passed by a Texas 
Legislature wInch bas alreadv legalized capital punishment iii recent sessions 
However, Hernandez’s bill has genuine merit and should indeed be passed. The killing of a human being i s (he most 

 s e r i o u s kind of thing that a state can decide to do. 
It is of such gravity that it surely ought to be done only with tin- kind of deliberate examination which assures a total ef­ fort at justice and a total absence of the possibility of redemption 
Surely it is not too much to ask that five judges of the highest court of the state for this kind of appeal agree that it should be carried out 
Must agree* 
The language of Rep 
Hernandez’s IIH588 is a sentence of death may not lie carried out unless the Court of Crim inal 
Appeals agrees unani­ mously that the judg­ ment of conviction and sentence of death be af­ firmed. 
“ If the conviction ol sentence is affirmed, but 

 the decision is less than unanimous, (lie Court of 
Criminal Appeals shall reform the sentence to confinement iii tin' Texas 
Department of Correc­ tions for lift' ” 

Both opponents and proponents of capital punishment should be able to find common grounds of concern for justice and human life to support the Texas Legis­ lature

T extbook debated 

DALLAS (AP) - The* adoption by the Dallas 
School District of a text­ book giving a Biblical version of the creation of man and the universe to balance evolution theory, has stirred controversy even among religious groups 
The textbook. 
“ Biology: A Search for 
Order in Complexity,“ was the subject of debate again during a public fo­ rum Thursday attended by education specialists and religious leaders 
Opposition to the text­ book is led by a group calling itself “ Americans 
United for the Separation of Church and State.”

 ry eyes caused by age 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I have been told the reason my eyes are so dry is that my tear duets are stopped up. I have been using artificial tears, but have heard that this can be corrected by surgery. Is this so? — J.F . 
Not from what you have written, lf the tear duet is plugged, tears continue to form but are spilled over the lids. Surgery can correct a plugged duct. How­ ever. the dry eye could result from a decrease in actual tear production, which can occur in older persons. 
Or you may have Sjo­ gren’s syndrome, in which there is a drying of other mucous mem­ branes, including those 
(rf the eyes. There is also an abnormality that de­ velops in the lids them­ selves which prevents pn>per blinking to keep the eyeball moist. 
Artificial tears help in the latter two conditions. 
They won’t correct any oHhe correctible condi­ tions (as plugged ducts) 
I retention above. An eye specialist would be able tb jpinpoint your problem and begin treatment, which may or may not include surgery. 

G out m ed ication 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I'm enclosing 35 cents and a stamped, self-addressed envelope for your gout 
KAtiklet. I hope it covers various medications. I have heard you must not take aspirins with gout drugs. 
True or false? — Mrs. U.I. 
I he gout booklet contains a lengthy section on drugs. As to aspirin, it should not be taken if you are taking probenicid, one of the control drugs. Any salicylate will interfere with its action. Incidentally, citrates should be avoided with sulfinpyrazone, an­ other gout medication. 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: I had surgery for fissures and anal stenosis five months ago. The area is easily irritated. Two questions: Is this a permanent after­ effect of the surgery? What limits should I put on the use of cortisone ointments? — Mrs. F.B. 
Anal fissure is a painful split in the membrane at the outer margin of the anal passage. Stenosis means there is narrowing of the passage, which can be produced by fissure scars. 
The main after-effects of surgery to correct this would be scar formation with some narrowing. Per­ iodic dilution may be in order, as well as an increase of bulk in your diet to help keep the muscles active. 
The condition need not be permanent. That is why you had the surgery to begin with. to take care of the narrowing. 
Continued prolonged use of the ointment would be determined by your own doctor, bused on effects and your needs. Prolonged use may have the same ef­ fects as would cortisone in any form. From the sound of your letter. I'd say you need some follow-up attention. 

You Can Stop Sinus Trouble!" is the title of Dr. Thosteson s booklet, explaining what sinus trouble reolly is and what can be 

 d o n e about it. For a copy write to him in care of this newspaper, enclosing a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope and 35 cents.

I recently went into a steak house and enjoyed the salad bar. 
However, there were no tomatoes 
This didn’t bother me too much because they had onions, different kinds of beans, beets and other salad ingredients and the price of tomatoes has been going up recently. 
However, when I got home. I saw an ad on television for the steak house and they showed people putting cherry tomatoes oil the salad — not once hut twice. 
I went back again and asked if they had any tomatoes when I found none at the salad bar. They said they did not. 
Now. the question I have is since the tomatoes are so prominent in the television ads if they don't have to provide tomatoes as shown on TV? 
Isn't the failure of the restaurant to provide the tomatoes alter showing them on television a ease iii' deceptive advertising? 

T. M. R A M IR E Z 

T 
WHERE WERE 
‘ MY TOMATOES 

Meg—— air i 

Whether the television 

 ads constitute deceptive advertising would have to ho something tor the courts to decide. 
Hut there is an easier 

 way to resolve this mat­ ter. 
The local manager of chain of these restau­ rants said the commer­ cial featuring cherry to­ matoes was purchased 

 from Arkansas. 
“ We have had cherry 

 tomatoes in the past, but we discontinued them when the prices went up recently," we were told 

The manager said he 

 plans to continue with the telev ision ads aud —• as a 

 result of your complain! and some others lodged at the local restaurants 
— will go huck and add cherry tomatoes to the salad bur. 
“ I don't want to raise 

 prices (on the steak din­ ners) so we w ill figure some other way to get the tomatoes bal k in the su- l.id b ar." he said. men­ tioning he would proba­ bly have to eliminate one of the other Ingredients offered now hut which is not featured so prom in­ ently Iii the telev isiou commercials. 
I .ii i n v your tomatoes 

 the next time with your steak. 

Can you do something about a sigil which I believe is a traffic hazard? 
It is on a building adjacent in 11135 and just north of Alamo Street 
They recently added a fluorescent sign with changeable letters that sticks out from the building. 
I ilo not object to tin* sign itself, lint merely to the fact that it is so close to the highway and shines right in the face of drivers as they are trying to negotiate what must be one of the worst curves iii the local expressway system. 
Naturally, it is only a problem at night 
Is there anything that can be done about this'.’ 
O . S. Ca 

Action Express drove 

 bv and took a look at the situation and agreed 

 there was a distraction caused by the sign — one which might possibly cause a d riv e r to lose momentary con centra­ tion and which might conceivably cause some sort of fender rubbing or lane w andering under some unusual conditions. 

 because of that chance, 

 we contacted the Stale 
Department of Highways and Public Transporta­ tion about the matter. 
They found they did not 

 have jurisdiction iii this particular instance. 
They, in turn, contact­ ed the D epartm ent of 
Public Safely. 

The answ er we got 

 through the highway 

 people was that since the sign is attached to the building, it is not within the legal jurisdiction ut regulations covering 

 such things as revolving lights or oilier signs. 
The slate officials do 

 have some control over flashing and/or revolving signs hut said this sign did not tail Into either of those categories. 
Actually, It Is probably 

 only a distraction lo mo torists the first time they see the sign. After that. they will probably Ignore it like other roadside signs 
Sorry, we tried, but the 

 sign seems to be legul at this point.

Marijuana put Donna on map 

A S S O C IA T E D PRESS 
D O N N A — M arijuana has put 
D onna on the m ap. 

The largest single marijuana confis­ cation in Texas history occurred Tues­ day just seven miles south of here when Drug Enforcement Administra­ tion and U.S. Customs agents stopped two large trucks transporting 18,12(1 pounds of the illegal weed. 
The previous record was set last 
December when state narcotic agents 
• descended on a Donna residence and discovered marijuana stacked to the ceiling of a bedroom and the garage. 
The grass weighed in at 17,79o pounds. 

The two confiscations total more than 18 tons a d, if divided among the 
8.ooo Donna residents, would provide more than four pounds of marijuana for every person in town. 
The wholesale value of the two loads is better than $4 million, said a DEA spokesman, 
Donna city officials admit their town has a drug problem but “ no worse than any other town in the Valley. 
“ We have the reputation, but I don’t think we have a problem that’s worse than any other town in the Valley,” said Police Chief Fernando Castaneda. 
“ We're close to the Rio Grande and there’s a good highway linking the 

 town with the river.” 
Donna is about 15 miles north of the 
Rio Grande and is seven miles east of 
U.S. 281, known as the “ marijuana highway.” 
“ Our police don’t have the men to handle all the citizens’ complaints such as burglaries and drag racers,” added Donna Mayor Hector Casiano. 
“ The federal and state officers are better equipped to slop the drug traf­ fic. 
“ We’re talking about a highly or­ ganized, technical group of men. They are very cunning and very shrewd.” 
Narcotics agents believe the two confiscations are related, based on an 

 informant who tipped the agents to 
Tuesday’s record haul. 
One agent said an organization re­ sponsible for. supplying more than 18 tons within a two-month period would have to involve at least 5o people on both sides of the river and have easy access to millions of dollars. 

Tuesday's nine ton load was meant to replace the marijuana confiscated in 
• December, theorized officers. 
A man described as a “ very trusted guard” was arrested in December at the Donna house and agents caught one of the two truck drivers—known as mules—during Tuesday’s raid. 

P e k in g s a y s C h ia n g is Just lik e S c a r le t t 

ASSOCIATED RUESS 
TOKYO — Mao Tse tung’s wi­ dow, Chiang Ching, was an admirer of “ Gone with the Wind, ’ and her critics now say that like the Amer­ ican novel’s heroine, 
Scarlett 
O'Hara, she was fanatic, arrogant and conceited. 

The Peking intellectual daily, 
Kwang-ming .lih-pao, made this judgment in an article entitled 
“ Chiang Ching and her ‘Foreign 
Sister,’ ” received in translation here Friday. 

A one-time Shanghai movie ac­ tress. the 62-year-old Chiang Ching 

 now is under arrest, accused along with the three leading Communist radicals of plotting to overthrow 
China's new party chairman, Hua 
Kuo-feng. 

“ This foreign sister is not a real person.” writes critic Feng Fei, 
“ but the heroine of an American fashionable novel in the 192os. This novel is called ‘Gone with the 
Wind.’ 

It said Chiang Ching wanted to turn back Chinese history to feudal society so that she could “ ascend the throne as an empress.”

If your house has hot w ater (hydronic) heat­ ing, chces are you can stay snug and warm all winter. The trick is to keep the thermostat set at the point that gives you and your family even heating, regardless of the v ariations in outside temperature. If you keep fiddling with the th e r­ mostat, it shows you are intermittently overheat­ ing and underheating.

Camelot community has it all ‘cooking’ 

T O 
; ' 

The Camelot lifestyle offers a lot of things, including a baked potato in IO minutes, a fried egg in 45 seconds; and a couple of hamburgers for a couple of hungry kids in 3o seconds. 
What’s that got to do with a Ray El- lison home in Camelot? 
Important feature 
Everything, if a person happens to believe that the kitchen is one of the most important features in a home. 
Whether the homeowner is a harried housewife in a hurry or someone w'ho just plain loves to cook, cooking in 
Camelot is super because kitchens in 
Camelot are super, too. 

The Litton Micromatic double oven in microwave range is standard equipment in some Camelot homes, and kitchen buffs who have seen it in action understand why the Litton is called “ the ultimate cooking center.’’ 

The Litten solid state Vari-Cook oven control permits variation of the mi­ crowave cooking speed, enabling the kitchen artist to cook, reheat, roast, simmer, warm and even defrost. 
Speed-cooking on top with the mi­ crowave oven and baking or broiling in the conventional oven are great ways to prepare lavish, special meals the cook usually dreads but the family loves to feast on The self-cleaning oven makes clean-up chores fast and 

 easy. 
But the Litton is only part of the 
Camelot kitchen story. There’s the stainless steel double sink, rich hand­ crafted wood cabinets, built-in dish­ washer, disposer plus easy viewing through the lovely French door leading from the kitchen into the backyard. 

Ray Ellison homes in Camelot offer more than just a super kitchen, of course. Every room in a Camelot home features the Ellison attention to detail that means a balanced combination of convenience, practicality and down­ right luxury. 
Thanks to its location in the north­ eastern quadrant of the city. Camelot is served by excellent schools at all 

C am elot by Ray Ellison Homes offers homes such as this one in a choice north­ eastern location, with Windsor Park Mall 

 nearby and within easy driving distance of either Randolph AFB or Fort Sam Houston.

 levels of the. educational ladder. The location is also tailored for easy access to the beautiful Windsor F’ark Mall and many large supermarkets, drug stores, specialty shops and restaurants established in the area. 
Commuting to Randolph A F B or 
Fort Sam Houston is a snap for mili-

 tary families. Although downtown at- Camelot seven days a week, rain or tractions are only a short drive away by expressway, Camelot is outside the reach of city taxes, bringing a new home into reach of the family that takes pride in holding the budgetary line on inflation. 
Model homes may be seen in 

 shine, at 823o New World Dr. 
Simply take N E. IH 35 to Walzem 
Road, turn east on Walzem past Wind­ sor Park Mall and follow the signs to 
New World Drive, where a new kind of world awaits in Camelot. And, super kitchens, too!

San Antonio EXPR ESS-N EW S— Saturday February 26 1977 

Morton/SW found ‘favorite’ 

San 
Antonians strongly favored the two different hous­ ing series Morton / Southwest featured last year. In fact, they put the building - developing firm on lop. 
Morton / Southwest still features 
Freedom Homes and Success Homes in three outstanding communities: Lake­ side, in southeastern Bexar County off 
U.S. Hwy. 87 outside S E. Loop 41o; 
Valley Forge, off O’Connor Road between Nacogdoches Road and N.E. 
Ill 35; and Cimarron, found just south of N.E. EM 1Ho4 east of Kitty Hawk 
Drive. 
Series well named 

The two series are aptly named, too. 
Freedom Homes are called that be­ cause they literally set buyers “ free from rent" into a new worid of home ownership. Success Homes are so named for the series' unique features 

 that would make the purchase of any a sure success. 
“ Affordability” is a kev word for each series. 
Fredom 
Homes are priced from as low as $28,5oo; Success, 
$34,ooo. No comparable homes are built for those kind of prices these, days; so, Morton / Southwest has a valid claim to leadership in San An­ tonio area housing. 
Morton / Southwest has drawn de­ signs from ingenious floor plans which have revolutionized the market for new homes by making them more afforda­ ble and more useful, sauare foot bv square foot. Traffic patterns are ideal. 
This is the way those who have had to rent actually sacrifice nothing at all when they buy and move into a new 
Freedom or Success home by Morton / 
Southwest. In fact, they gain all they've ever wanted. 
Freedom Homes go far beyond the basics, too. They feature frill modern families have come to expect in a new home. This indeed, is just one of the 

 many reasons Freedom Homes have gained such widely spread popularity. 
Their three- and four-bedroom plans include two complete baths generally sought by home buyers today. All this is figured into an attractively afforda­ ble package in a price range families today can afford. A Freedom home is no “ pearl of great price." 
Pantry kitchens feature the right kind of appliances to lessen the work­ load for today’s homemaker. Dish­ washer, disposers, ranges, vent hoods and abundant cabinetry are provided in Freedom Homes. All appliances carry the reliable Magic Chef brand name. 
Other extras Morton / Southwest has made available in Freedom Homes are wall-to-wall closets with storage space extending all the way to the ceiling and sliding doors of panel designs, finished two-car garages, utility and work ar­ eas, patios with sliding glass doors, clever blends of masonry and wood for striking exteriors, carpeting of the 

 buyers’ choices of colors and kinds. 
Friedrich central air and heat systems and, in most, woodburning fireplaces. 
Success Homes v ividly reveal that an enjoyable home remains the “ great 
American dream” and one that can be realized without great sacrifice. 
The large amounts of total square footage in the Success plans can be seen in spacious family rooms, separ­ ate dining areas, large family rooms and sizeable living rooms. In fact, even the patios for Success Homes are fa­ mily sized. 
Also encompassed are the large, de­ corative all-electric kitchens. They boast space-saving built-ins like Magic 
Chef ranges, ovens, vent hoods, dish­ washers and stainless steel Waste King disposers. 
But the scope of Success Homes, of course, goes beyond their “ furnisha- ble” and useful space. The luxury ap­ pointments add much to how they pre­ sent more than the money’s worth. 
They include shag carpeting in liv-

At once impressive it is, but the striking design used for L ’Atrium s of 
Cinnamon Creek is not really anything new. It just looks that way. 
No other apartment project in the San Anton­ io area even resembles it. 
The design, however, ac­ tually is based on archi­ tectural trends as long ago as ancient Greece and Home. 
Two words 
The name L ’Atrium is derived from two words: 
“ L-shaped“ and 
“ atrium ,” each repre­ senting architectural de­ sign during the “ classi­ cal ages.” 
Put the two together and you have it, a L ’A­ trium. But that’s only the game of the name. 
A community just north of Fredericksburg 
Road and 
Hamilton- 
Wolfe Road intersection, 
Cinnamon Creek, almost directly across the street from USAA headquarters and close to the South 
Texas Medical Center, allots as many as 25 acres for L ’Atriums out of the new' northwestern com m unity’s 247 total acreage. Thus, the pro­ ject’s tree-studded pre­ mises actually are quite open. 
The seemingly new de­ sign applied to L ’A ­ triums apartments works as well as it always has. 
In fact, it’s one way of 

 overcoming the sacri­ fices of privacy and space in apartment living today. 
For instance, no L ’A­ trium resident lives either above or below another. Each atrium is screened with a six-foot privacy fence and. as ad­ ded touches of privacy, there are doorbells on both the front gates andj front doors. 
Sliding glass walls open to the enclosed patio in the living area for an extra dimension of space and accent on the in ­ door-outdoor living style of these apartments. 
Added conveniences are washer-dryer con­ nections in two- and three-bedroom plans with separate utility areas off the kitchens. 
Master bedrooms can easily accommodate ex­ tra large furniture with­ out crowding. Separate dressing vanities are an­ other luxury feature of some plans, also with large refrigerators, freezers, ranges, dish­ washers and disposers. 
Some plans have the country kitchens with se­ parate breakfast areas. 
Others have pass-thru windows to a serving bar on the atrium. 
Eight different plans are offered among the apartments with one, two or three bedrooms. 
This weekend the 

 highlight is the two- story, two-bedroom townhouse style ideal for roommate arrangements because each bedroom is the same size and yields access to a full bath. One is upstairs to enhance the privacy roommates are seeking these days. 
All L ’Atrium s have individually controlled 

 heat and air condition­ ing, shag carpeting and assigned, covered park­ ing space. Amenities for all residents here include a large swimming pool on the tree-shaded pre­ mises. Costs of operating utilities are included in monthly rental rates, too. 
L ’Atrium s of Cinna­ mon Creek is a project 

 widely acclaimed. Built and developed by Clark- 
Frates Corp., it has re­ ceived citations from 
Westinghouse as an “ in­ novative contribution to the field of apartment design” and from the 
Apartment Construction 
News as a “ distinguished multi-family housing de­ sign and development.”

Rare success tale misleads 

SreCIAl TO THE GOEDEN TWINS 
COLLEGE 
STATION 
- 
Stories of fortunes made “over­ nigh t” in real estate have created a general misconception of how much brokers and sales­ men really earn, says a Texas A 
& M University researcher. 
Dr. Arthur Wright of the Texas Real 
Estate Research Center (TRERC) em­ phasizes the widespread belief that the majority of real estate licensees make trem endously large incomes is un­ founded. 
Small compensation 

“ While stories of those earn in g 
$3o-4o.ooo in real estate in a very short time are usually true.” he adds, “ the fact is many brokers and salesmen receive rather small compensation for the time they work.” 
Wright admits data on incomes of real estate professionals is skimpy at best. The picture is clouded by many with second incomes, those working only part time and licensees who are not engaged in active selling. 
The TRERC researcher points out that movies, books, magazines and the new media have helped substantiate the public’s belief real estate profes­ sionals reap large commissions for a little work, when, in fact, the opposite is usually true. 
“ Real estate professionals are like any other group. There are those who have worked hard to get a h e a d ,” 
Wright notes. “ A few make $1oo,ooo per year. A few make $1,ooo per year. 
The majority is somewhere between these extremes.” 
Wright analyzed two of Texas’ stan­ dard metropolitan statistical areas and found the average broker's office has an annual gross commission of slightly less than $21,ooo. He notes many of these are one-man operations with low overhead. 

“ In most cities, a few firms do more than a proportional share of the total business,” he says. “ About 2o per cent of the firms do at least 75 per cent of the business.” 

Wright’s figures for the studied ar­ eas indicate the top 2o per cent are averaging more than $77,ooo in annual gross income while the remaining HO per cent, have an average gross bro­ kerage commission of only $6,HOO per office. 

A comparable analysis for salesmen indicated the average income in the studied areas to be slightly less than 
$5,1oo. However, Wright adds that be­ cause diverse operations are common in real estate, av erages must be viewed accordingly. Many individuals work and earn incomes from other ar­ eas of real estate, such as appraisal and property management, and do not rely solely on selling. 

The TRERC researcher estim ates the top 2o per cent of salesmen to have an average gross annual income of just over $19,ooo while the re m a in d e r earned only $16,ooo in annual commis­ sions. 
As far as residential real estate in 
Texas is concerned, business is still good, Wright says. The number of li­ censed brokers and salesmen — ap­ proximately 89,3oo in September — continues to set records. 
During the four quarters ending in 
August, the Multiple Listing Services in the 26 major Texas cities sold some 
72.3oo single-family homes at an aver­ age price of slightly more than $34,7oo. 
“ Assuming MLS m embers sold 5o per cent of all homes,” Wright con­ tinues, “ more than $2.5 billion in sin­ gle-family homes were sold in the state during the year.” 
He points out this figure could be even nigher because of some cities such as Houston, where MLS members account for an even greater percentage of homes sold.

Your CM Home. 

I'm Buddy Burns. And I’d like to shed some baht on your old home. It your home is 
5 years old or older, chances are it's obsolete 
That's right, obsolete. Be­ cause at the time your home was built, there were virtually no encrgy-effi- ciency standards As a result, many San Antonians arc faced with utility bills that may soon exceed their house payments! 

Why NOW la The Time To Buy. 
Let s look at the facts. Since you invested in your home a tew years ago, two things have hap­ pened For one, you've been making house payments tor sev­ eral years, so your equity has g 

 rown Too, since the cost of udding a new home has stead­ ily increased, the cost ot replac­ ing; your home has increased. 
BUT, because your old home isn't energy efficient, it wastes valuable energy Ana believe it or not, homeowners around the country are actually beginning to lo se money when they sell their older homes. Because no­ 

 body wants to buy a home where the cost of heating and cooling exceeds the monthly payments.

Ray Ellison Sr., San Antonio's largest homebuilder and chair­ man of the hoard of Ray Ellison 
Industries, predicts that now home sales during 1977 could increase by as much as 5o per cent over 1978. 
Ellison, who sells every fourth house built in the Alamo City and whose homes now house approximately 7o.(K IO 
San Antonians, noted that new home sales by his firm during January dou­ bled projections forecast in December and, as well, nearly doubled actual sales during January, 1976 
Traditionally larger 
“ January is traditionally one of tin* larger sales months of thp year,” El lison pointed out, “ so we’ve got to he guided by some restraint in judging the future. But 1 11 venture that, if the next couple of months hear up the trend, w’p‘11 be looking at a very good year, overall ” 
Total new home sales by Ellison during 1976 exceeded totals for 1975 by nearly 3o per cent 
Ellison stated that his firm is re ­ sponding to dem and by launching more housing starts during the first two months of the year than in any comparable period in the entire history of the company. 
Ellison also indicated that occupancy rates for his 2,1oo-plus apartment units were up from an average of about 92 per cent in 1975 to nearly 97 per cent in 
1976 He believes occupancy rates will remain relatively stable during 1977, 
“except for those families who decide that this is Hie year to move to their own home.” 
He pointed out that some of the tra­ ditional ad van tages sought by the apartment dweller are going through a state ol transition. “ Inflation will con­ tinue to give apartment rents a per­ sistent nudge upwards.” he said, “ and we’re going to see more responsibility for utility costs shifted from the land­ lord to the a p a rtm e n t dw eller by means of checking meters and indivi­ dual metering.” 
Ellison pointed to commercia! pro­ perties as another area of emphasis during 1977. “ Prime commercial real estate is a very attractive investment now,” he said, “ involving large sums of money." In “ one of the largest eas transactions for commercial land in 
San Antonio history," Ray Ellison In­ dustries iast November sold 7o acres on IValzern Road east of N E. HI 35 in a 
$5 million transaction with real estate un astor-developer Charles VV. Wind­ 

 ham and Fedmart Corp . through the brokerage of Jo hn D. B aines P ro ­ perties. Other commercial land tran­ sactions involving Ellison properties during 1976 included sale of seven- and four acre sites for new Woolen and 
Handy Dan facilities in southwestern 
San Antonio. 
Ellison said that inflationary factors would continue to be felt throughout the housing industry during 1977 hut maintained that many families were determined to carry through with new home purchases despite rising costs. 
“ Cost of lumber and other building m aterials are going to continue to rise,” he said, “ and I don ! believe anyone sees any immediate relief in sight. Also, even though interest rates may he relatively stable now, I don’t believe they can he held down for­ ev er.” Because of the inflationary pressures, Ellison says, one of his firm’s primary objectives at the pre­ sent time is “ to see how we can keep that inflationary gap just as narrow as possible, without compromising Hie quality of our product ” 
He said th at, am ong other long- range possibilities, Ellison financial analysts were closely watching the ex­ periment in governm ent-sponsored variab le interest ra te p ro g ra m s, whereby young families could pay a relatively low interest rate during the first years of home purchase, with ad­ ditional interest increments being ad­ ded as family income grows with time. 
“The price of a new home is going up at a rate of about Va of I per cent month.” he said, “ and I don’t think that can be stopped in light of econo­ mic realities But the homebuyer is looking at the oiher side of the coin — which holds true whether he’s buying an Ellison home or considering some other builder — and that* the fact that. if he buys now, he’s going to have the advantage of substantial increases in his own equity. Ile wants to get started on that now ” 
Ellison added he believed the home­ buyer today was looking for more than lust a basic shell of a house, despite relatively high costs 
“ Today’s homeowner realizes that one of the last vestiges of personal pride of ownership in this country is the American home,” he said. “ People w ant as much as I hey can get for their dollar, and that includes comfort and spaciousness because that’s the kind of lifestyle they want for their families. 
We believe we’re building the kind of home they’re looking tor. at reasonable prices, and we’re doing everything we can to keep prices in line with people s expectations."

Prof says slowness of housing recovery no cause for alarm 

Housing has marched to a different tune during the current economic re­ covery. 
Ordinarily a leader in pulling the country out of a recession, residential building in the second quarter of 1975 started procyclically, expanding together with the general economy instead of ahead of it. 
Sour notes 
The current pace of housing's recovery, how­ ever, has been moderate, leading some observers to detect some sour notes in the expansionary movement. 
And yet, pointed out 
Leo (irebler, guest auth­ or in the current edition of the Mortgage Guaran­ ty Insurance Corp news­ 

 letter, housing’s perfor­ mance presently is not without precedent. “ The business recoveries of 
195K and I HBI showed si­ milar, though less con­ sistent, procyclical movements,’’ he noted. 
Grebler is professor emeritus of urban land economics at the Univer­ sity of California at Los 
Angeles. 

The author used a scale based on housing starts dnd the dollar outlay for residential construction to measure the strength of the current expansion. 
He concluded that 
“ among the six post-war housing upswings long enough for comparison of starts, the current gain of 
4H per cent ranks fourth.

 residential construction expenditures of 29 per cent ranks fifth among seven periods of expan­ sion for which compara­ ble data are reported.” 
In the current reco­ very, Grebler continued, 
“ the increase of residen­ tial construction expen­ ditures has contributed a little over IO per cent to the increase of C N P. 
This ranks near the bot­ tom in comparison to previous periods of GNP expansion.** 
With that kind of rank­ ing in comparison to previous periods of GNP expansion, housing has neither led the current business recovery nor has it been a major ex­ pansionary force. “ Its relative weakness.” not­ ed Grebler, “ is partly associated with the fact that residential construc­ tion has been standing on one leg — home building; the m ultifam ily sector has been languishing.” 
Apartment units ac­ counted for 44 per cent of all starts in the 197o • 72 building boom, slipped to 
24 per cent at the bottom of the recessionary per­ iod and have remained about the same during the current recovery. 
A combination of actors has been respon­ sible for the slow overall recovery of housing. 
These include: 
•An overhang prob­ lem. The building boom of 197o - 72 created an excess supply of new un­ its which the home buy­ ing public could not ab­ sorb during the business decline of 1974 and early 
1975. The overall result was a 2Lj-year housing recession, the worst since 
World War IL 
•Credit conditions. In­ terest rates for conven­ tional loans on new homes increased through 
1974, along with the re­ quired amount of down payments. The availabi­ lity of funds did not begin to increase substantially until late 1974. 
Purchase prices have not been the major cul­ prit in slowing the reco­ very, 
Grebler m ain­ tained 
FH LBB data show that the average price of new homes advanced by 29 per cent between 1973 and the second quarter of 
1976, when personal dis­ posable income in cur­ rent dollars went up 3o per cent. There was a somewhat greater price increase for existing homes. 
The author concluded that “ the data reveals no serious maladjustment between house prices and consumer income in cur­ rent dollars.” 
Grebler saw a positive aspect to the slow reco­ very of residential build­ ing. He theorized that "lf the business recovery continues at a moderate rate, it may be sustained for a longer period, avoid boom excesses and be followed by a milder set­ back when it has run its course," 
Grebler also noted that the adverse might occur, stimulated in part by the new adm inistration in 
Washington.

Mulches help lawn, garden

CO UNTY EXTENSION HORTICULTURIST 
It can be straw, oak leaves, pine bark, peanut hulls, cedar flakes, sawdust or wood shav­ ings — even rocks, gravel or sand. Whatever the material, it s called mulch; the real green thumbs wouldn’t garden without it. 
A mulch aids in maintaining a fa­ vorable condition of the soil under­ neath. Either organic or inert mater­ ials may have sim ilar effects upon plants. The increased plant growth is due primarily to conditions resulting from the use of a given material rather than any growth promoting substances present in the mulch itself. 
Beneficial effects 

Mulch materials have many benefi­ cial effects upon the soil, plants and area surrounding the plants. Some ex­ amples are: 
•C onserves soil moisture by reduc­ ing the evaporation of water from the soil. 
•Prevents crusting of the soil sur­ face, thus improving absorption and percolation of water to the soil areas where the roots are growing. 
• Maintains a more uniform soil temperature by acting as an insulator that keeps the soil warm during cool spells and cooler during the warm months of the year. 
•Reduces weed problems when the mulch material itself is weed-free and is applied deeply enough to prevent 
SABO R members go to NAR 

Six 
San 
Antonians were among 4,ooo persons attending the National Association of 
Realtors Mid-Winter Meetings held recently in Anaheim, ( alif. 
Members of the San Antonio Board of Realtors at the meetings included 
Bob Jones, Guy Chipman Jr., Reese 
Henry, Ray Ragsdill and Starr Keal- hofer, executive vice president of the board. 
Backgrounds 

Jones and Chipman are members of the hoard of directors of the national organization. Jones, a commissioner of the Texas Real Estate Commission, is a member of the License Law Com­ mittee of the NAR. 
Henry is president of the Texas As­ sociation of Realtors Ragsdill, of the 
San Antonio board. 
At the meeting, the president of the 
NAR predicted a record year in 1977 for sales of existing single-family homes in the United States. 

He is Harry Elmstrom, a Realtor from Ballston Spa, N. Y. who forecast that a record 3.4 million existing sin­ gle-family homes valued at $153 billion will be sold during the year. 
Although nearly three out of every four home purchases will be existing homes this year, he said, new home construction should also enjoy a ban­ ner year. New home starts should number 1.8 million, 18 per cent better than last year and 55 per cent above 
1975. Of this number. 1.3 million are expected to be single-family dwellings, the remainder of which will be multi­ family starts.

 weed seed germination or smother ex­ isting smaller weeds. Time and labor of weeding garden areas is reduced considerably when mulches are used properly. 
•Adds to the beauty of the landscape by providing a cover of uniform color which can he neutral or non-detracting and may add an interesting texture to an otherwise drab surface. 
• Mulches can prevent fruit and plants from becoming mud splashed and reduce losses from soil-borne dis­ eases. 
. 
•Mulches can be used to prevent freezing injury to flowers of such plants as strawberries when late 
Spring frosts threaten loss of crop. On such occasions, mulching materials such as straw may be lurked onto the plants as often as necessary to protect the flowers. Upon rem oval, the mulching m aterial can be placed between the rows to keep developing fruit clean 
Whatever material you select, make sure the mulch allow water to pene­ trate to the soil below. Oak leave;- will do fine without grinding. Fin ely ground peat moss tends to keep water out, but coarse peat moss makes a fair mulch. 
Apply Summer mulch around your plants one to two inches deep in late 
Spring after the ground has warmed and plants are growing. Don't remove 
Summer mulch at the end of the growing season. Let it rot into the soil. 
This Full before Winter, apply a mulch two to three inches deep. Place it uniformly around the plants. 
A mulch should be maintained ar­ ound the plants all year. Every two or three years, the old mulch should be removed and fresh applied. When an organic mulch is used, control mea­ sures for certain soil-borne insects may ha v t to be applied. 
Many gardeners are turning to the special decorative mulches such as pine bark, crushed pecan hulls, gravel and sand. You can find these mulches in just about all colors, sizes and tex­ tures at garden supply stores. Spread this type of mulch about two inches thick except when rocks are used. 
Rocks should bo in a thicker layer of up to four or five inches 
When a large, open aren is covered with a decorative mulch particularly white rook or bark, underline the mulch with black plastic to help keep weeds from growing through it You must provide a grade or trench for water to drain off plastic. Otherwise, algae and mosses will cover the mulch. 
Do not put the plastic too close to the plant. If you do, water will not reach the plant roots. 
Decorative mulch requires almost daily care to keep it attractive. Litter accumulates rapidly. Be sure to keep some extra mulch on hand because mulch slowly disappears from com­ paction and handling. 
Try mulching; I think you will find it to he one of your hest gardening practices.

“ Of course, we're thrilled with the amount of our sales," he added. 
“ But more than that; it means we’re doing our job right We’re provid­ ing San Antonians with the kind of real estate services they want.” 

Louver doors 
Closet space may ap­ pear inadequate, not for the space inside, but be­ cause of the closet doors. 
Ordinary closet doors in small rooms or in narrow hallways make closets seem cramped because the doors take up so much floor space when they are open. Folding or sliding wood louver doors on the other hand take up little, if any, floor space and provide ventilation Ut keep clothes fresh smelling and free of mil­ dew.

Growing into and out of things is fun... 

 but expensive 

It costs money to stop using 

 perfectly good articles 

 because you have outgrown 

 them. It costs money to 

 replace them, too. Many 

 folks solve both problems by 

 selling the used and buying 

 the useable through 

E X P R E S S N E W S classified ads. 

Why not use this simple solution to a growing 

 family problem!

IRS agent seeks damages 

An Internal Revenue Service agent bas tilt'd suit in federal court to block an IRS investiga­ tion of bis finances. 
Russell T. Johnson, 219 W onder 
Parkway, has asked for $7oo,ooo in da­ mages because he claims the IR S has invaded his privacy and violated his rights. 
Johnson alleges the IRA acted ille­ 

 gally by contacting other people — in­ cluding business associates — without telling him. 
He also claims summonses the IR S issued to his business associates were illegal because he is not the target of a tax audit. 
In its answer to the suit. IRS asserts 
Johnson has not exhausted his admin­ istrative remedies to end the alleged grievance. 
> 

The agency also said the internal investigations are necessary. 

“ The agency must maintain at all times the confidence of the taxpaying public and personnel must be of the utmost honesty and integrity,” the government's attorney staled. 

During the course of the 18-month investigation, Johnson alleged IR S 

 agents have threatened his associates with legal action to get information. 
The agents also used abusive lan­ guage and tried to force their way into his associate’s homes, he alleged. 
Johnson stated he is a revenue of­ ficer with IRS. 
Ile is represented by attorneys with the N ational T reasu ry Em ployes 
Fnion, court records indicate.

After Seguing Stanley Jackson made the second of the M atadors’ two baskets in the q u a rte r, the 
Volunteers blasted to a 3o-19 half­ time lead. 
With Lee’s lead, the rem ainder of the contest was an uphill battle for Seguin. Several tim es in the second half the Volunteers went to a controlled passing game, while 
Seguin hustled, scram bled and tried to score whenever it could. 
A fine outside shooting display by Jackson and the penetration of guard Herbert Coe kept the M a­ tadors in the game. But they could not overtake the well-drilled 
Volunteers. 
Brown led Lee with 15 points, w hile S tanley and Bill Bond scored 12 each. Jim m y Stew art also had IO for the Vols.

“ We got the big lead by hitting well at first,” said coach Jam es Leonard, 
“ but then we lost it by tun many tu r­ novers and fouls. 
“ Then we started hitting again and at the last were especially hitting our foul shots.” 
Three Clemens starter fouled out in the fourth quarter, but the team held its lead behind offensive captain Susan 
House, who hit 13 of 15 from the line in 
(he final stanza. 
Asked if he thought the Buffettes played well in w inning th e ir 34th straight game without a loss. Leonard relied. "No. not with 35 turnovers (the 

 officials s ta tis tic sheet had 26 for 
Clemens and 24 for Arlington). 

He and assistant Lynn Dodge had gotid reason to worry when fouls sta rt­ ed sending th e ir s t a r t e r s to the sidelines in the last quarter, but Mrs. 
Dodge pointed out, ‘‘S u s a n ’s free throws in the last quarter helped a lot, just like when we played W eslaco.” 

Defensive captain ca p ta in Sylvia 
Godfrey was the first Buffette to leave on fouls when she departed for only the second time all year with 6:34 rem ain­ ing in the game. 
Leonard sw itch ed 5-11 fo rw a rd 
Darcy Haxton to guard and the latter had two defensive rebounds and forced 

 a turnover at midcourt before fouling out herself with 4:38 showing. 
“ Haxton plays a real fine guard and 
I thought she would do a good job th e re ,’’ Leonard explained adding, 
“ We have a real good substitute at forward in Kathy Shea." 
When Haxton fouled out, Leonard called on Sheryl House, who played seven minutes when Godfrey was in foul trouble but who was also below par with the flu. 
“ She had a tem perature of a 1o1 de­ grees before the gam e,” said Mrs. 
Dodge, and Leonard said, “ I d id n ’t want to play her anymore than I had to. 
Rouse’s accuracy at the line and four buckets by Rose Penkunis always kept 
Clemens ahead by at least five points.

Rattlers do or die 

By CLIFFORD BROYLES 
O f THE EXPRESS NEW S STAPP 

“ A loss and your season is over.” 
St. Mary's Coach Ed Messbarger knows its down to that part of the season as his 
Snakes battle Howard P ayn e Saturday night in the NAIA District 4 playoffs. 

The two team s will tip off at 7:3o p.m. at Alumni 
Gym. 
The w in n er a d v a n c e s to the D istric t 4 finals against the winner of the Texas Lutheran-East Tex­ as gam e in Commerce. That too will be a one shot deal. 
Howard Payne, which like St. M ary’s has a 22-5 record, defeated the Snakes last season for the right to advance to the NAIA Tournament in Kansas City 
In a best-of-three series. This is the district’s first year under the four team format. 
Best mark 
The Yellow Jackets had the best conference record in the U»ne Star Conference, but lost the cham pion­ ship gam e of the LSC Tourney to East Texas. 77-66. 
St. M ary’s was breathing new life Friday as the 
NAIA absolved the school of any wrongdoing after completing an investigation into the eligibility of 
Rattler Jam es Gray. 
G ray’s eligibility had been questioned earlier in the week and Messbarger said the team did not work out Wednesday because of an on-campus evaluation of the situation. 
Performance 

What effects the probe m ay have on the Snake performance cannot be evaluated at this time. 
M essbarger’s biggest problem will be determ in­ ing whether Mark Pawzun plays of note. 

Pawzun has been bothered with a back injury. which became inflamed earlier in the week and has hampered him most of the season. 
Messbarger said Friday he would go with fresh­ man Johnny Whittle!! has the 1oth man on the roster and either Pawzun or J a m e s Gray would fill the eleventh spot.

Father Tim e heals coaches’ wounds 

KANSAS CITY — Father Time might be the greatest medicine man of them all. The trials and troubles that brought tears and anguish just a few months ago were rehashed and convected into laughter here the other night. 
Nine of the nation’s most successful football coaches last season met with about 4o writers from around the country at this special 
NCAA seminar. There were some interesting sessions. 
John Robinson, Southern Cal’s rookie head coach, seemed an unlikely candidate to wind up here, telling of his fine season, when he made his debut last September against Missouri. The Trojans had been heavily favored but the form chart — and Robinson — got bumped that night. 

Looking back. Robinson told how his 
17-year-old freshm an cen ter started things rolling in the wrong direction. 
“ We w ere both n erv o u s. M ike 
McDonald was just a youngster, play­ ing in his first collegiate gam e, before a crowd of 1oo,ooo and television. He had a lot of pressure on him. I did too, since it was my first gam e as head coach at USO,” Robinson said. 
And how did M a rk r e a c t to the pressure? 

“ He must have set an all-time NC AA record on his first center snap from punt formation,: Robinson said. “ Ile snapped the ball 47 yards, about IO feet over the punter’s head. Boy, was he ashamed and disgusted when he came to the sidelines. He had tears stream­ ing down his cheeks but I must have made him feel good because when he got to me on the sidelines I had bigger tears rolling from my eyes.” 

Robinson waited for the laughter to fade and then he continued. 
“ The kid kept saying over and over to me, ‘I’m sorry, coach, i'm sorry.’ 
And I kept saying back to him. ‘I’m sorry too. son, really sorry.’ Lord, we must have made a strange air and un­ usual sight, the two of us there to­ gether, crying on the sidelines.” 
Of c o u rs e , th in g s got b e tte r for 
Robinson, McDonald and Southern Cal after that opener. The Trojans wound ii)) in the Rose Bowl and Robinson wound up here at this NCAA session. 
Cold, cold Montana 

Sonny Holland, whose Miuituna State te a m won the D ivision II n atio n al crown, brought a fresh and sparkling sense of humor to this series of m eet­ ings. 
Sonny looks Uke a h ea v y w e ig h t sparring partner who worked too long without his headgear but he's got a sharp mind and quick wit. 

H olland's only com plaint about 
Montana and his working conditions is the constant cold weather each fail. 
Talking about the sta te’s snowfall. 
Sonny said. “ Our weather stays about the same each football season, clear and still. Clear up to your tail and still coining down." 

J e rr y C laiborne, whose M aryland 
T erps lust to Houston in the Cotton 
Bowl, told how he was shocked in the opening quarter when Houston jumped on top 21-o. 
"I couldn’t get a chance to talk to my defense and try to straighten things out.” Je rry said. 
"A fter Houston’s first score I called our defense together on the sidelines and tried to make some adjustments. 
But then we lost a fumble and our de­ fense had to go back in. Houston scored again. I got the boys back together oft the sidelines but before we could get organized Houston blocked our punt so our defense had to go back to work. I didn’t se‘c much of the first period at all and I sure didn t do any good trying to m ake adjustm ents in the opening quarter.” 
T hen C laib o rn e told of the sick feeling that hit him last New Y ear's 
Day. 

"Before I knew it the first quarter was out and we were behind 21-o. My mind im m ediately m ultiplied tour times 21 and I knew iii an instant that if things didn’t change we were going to get beat 84-o. My Lord, my knees got weak," Jerry recalled. 

VINCE DOOLEY 
. . . a wig 

He smiles while his audiences laugh at that story now but it wasn't funny then. At least, it wasn’t funny to Jerry. 
S o m etim e d u rin g the afternoon he m u s t have m a n a g e d a few choice words with his defense because Mary­ land wound up losing by just 3o-21. 
Bald Vince 
G eorgia’s Vinco Dooley set the re­ cord straight early when he first met with writers here. 
" I ’d like to put a stop to any and all rum ors that say that I'm w earing a partial toupee. I ain not," he said. But then he added, “ this thing on the top of my head is a full wig.” 
Early in the season, after each vic­ tory. Georgia players began shaving their heads. Dooley promised that he too would get a c o m p lete sh av e if 
Georgia won a conference crown and wound up in a major bowl. 
“ It wasn't too bad. being so bald, because I learned to relate with a lot of new heads." Vince said. He claim s the reason he went to the wig. while wait­ ing for more growth, is that the winter winds w ere ju st too cold on a bald head. Besides, after such a great sea­ son it was a sham e that nobody recog­ nized a bald Vince Dooley. 
Aggies win 

COLLEGE STATION (AP) - Texas 
A&M's Mike Ross hurled a six-hit shutout as the Aggies downed Arkan­ sas 6-o in both school’s Southwest 
Conference opening baseball game. 
Ross received hitting help from so­ phomore rightfielder Shelton McMath who went three for four including his second home run of the season.

Enthusiasm , intensity, and defense will be the key words for 
Trinity’s basketball coach Pete 
Murphy next season. 

"W e’ve got to play with more enthu­ siasm and with m ore intensity next season.” Murphy said. " I f s tough, I know, getting the kids to realize this because, in a program like we have* 
(non-sch o larsh ip ), basketball is s e ­ condary Most of our players are con­ cerned with their studies."

“ We got c m b u ra sse d a couple of tim es this season because we didn t platy with intensity," Murphy explains.

We've got to improve on it.

“ I feel like we have a nucleus of a good ball d u b coining back,” Murphy explained. " I ’ve got to find a good size guard and a quick forward to go along with -it. At tim es, our short g u ard s were out m anned physically, and we definitely need another forward.

All bloodletting in a single day 

Cage clash set today 

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Saturday February 26 1977 

SPECIAL TO THE LX PPtSS 
KINGSVILLE — The Pearsall Ma­ vericks make their bid for the state tournament at the Region IV Class AA boys* tournament Saturday at Texas 
A&l. 
The M avericks (24-4) tangle with 
W eimar at 11:3o a.m. Saturday after 
Yoakum and La Joya open the meet at 
9 Jo a m. 
Those two winners meet at 6:3o p m for a berth in the state tournam ent next weekend in Austin. 

Bills aimed at curtailing catches of red fish in bays along the coast will be heard in Austin 
Wednesday. As one fellow put it, all the blood will be spilled at one time. 

Three redfish bills, two in the house and one in the senate, are scheduled for hearings on the sam e day. and the hearings are expected to draw largo — and probably vociferous — crowds of commercial and sport fishermen. 
The first hearing will be on S B. 624, sponsored by Sen. A R. Schwartz of 
Galveston, at 3 p.m. in the lieutenant governor's com mittee room of the ca­ pitol The m easure is called the Texas lied Drum Conservation Act and will be h e a rd by the n a tu ra l re s o u rc e s committee. 
The two house hills are 1(177 by Rep. 
Tom S h id ler of Fort Worth and I(»K4 by 
Rep. Joe Allen of Baytown. The. hear­ ing before the environm ental affairs c o m m itte e is set for 7:3o p .m . 
Wednesday on the house floor. 

Both hills, which are similar, will he heard at the same time. Both are. as tar as I have been able to determine, companions to the senate hill by 
Schwartz. All three would pill hag and a size lim its on redtish caught by commercial and sport fishermen in the hays of Texas. 

P ro p o se d bag and size lim its on reds, w hich, according to fisheries biologists, are being harvested to the limit, are: 
Commercial — IOO pounds of whole reds per person or 2oo pounds of w hole reds |Hir boat nr conveyance: m inim um size. 14 inches; m a x im u m size, 35 inches. Sport — IO reds per day and 2o in possession, of which not more than two could be larg e r than 35 inches; minimum size. 14 inches. 
Never oil weekends 
The m easures also would establish a special c o m m ercial redfish license, require m eshes of tra m m e l and gill nets to be larger than current regula­ tions and prohibit netting and most trotlining of redfish on Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
Biologists are concerned about the future of the redfish in Texas waters because must of the Bsh now being caught are taken before they arc old enough to spaw ii

Another nationally televised boxing card might be carried live from San 
Antonio in the near future. 
A syndicated television firm, which plans a Friday night boxing series, has contacted local promoter Tony Padilla and expressed interest in televising a boxing card live from S A on April 22. 
Earlier this week ABC Television’s 
Wide World of Sports announced that it will carry a boxing tournament Mar. 27 at Lackland AFB. Howard Cosell and 
George Foreman are expected to do 

 the commentary. 
Veteran ring voice Don Dunphv would do the announcing on the April 
22 card. Padilla was told. 

Padilla said the television people want to show' their own two bouts — 
Eduardo Lopez vs. Rodney Bobick and 
Rafael Rodriguez vs. Mike Everett — but he. as promoter of the card, would be able to add as many as he wants. 

Padilla has until Tuesday to accept the offer.

UNIONDALE. N Y. (A P) - Howard 
Porter scored 25 points Friday night, leading Detroit to a 112-1o6 triumph over the New York Nets in a see-saw 
National Basketball Association game marred by the ejection of the Pistons’ 
Marvin Barnes. 
Barnes was involved in a fracas with 
New York’s Mike Buntom with 1o:27 remaining in the second period and was ejected from the game by referee 
Bob Rakel fur a flagrant elbowing foul. 
Barnes apparently threw an elbow at 
Bantom as the New York forward brought the ball up court.* Buntom retaliated with a swing which appar­ ently caused a two-stitch cut over 
Barnes’ left eye. but Bantom was allowed to stay in the game. 
Pistons Coach Herb Brown an­ nounced that the game was being played under protest because Buntom was not ejected, but was expected to rescind the protest because Detroit won.

KANSAS CITY (A P) - Dan Issei, who scored 21 points in the first quarter, connected on two tree throws with four seconds left to give the

Umps call strike 

NEW YORK (AP) - Major league umpires were* told F ri­ day not to report to baseball’s spring training camps without a contract but two involved parties said they were optimis­ tic an agreement might be reached next week. 

The next negotiating session between the Major League Umpires’ Associa­ tion and representatives of the Ameri­ can and National Leagues is scheduled 
Tuesday in Tampa, with another meeting on Thursday, if necessary. 
Dick Butler, the A L’s supervisor of umpires, said “ some progress’’ was made at a negotiating session In New 
York last week and described himself as “ very optimistic.” 

Trouble 
Meanwhile, American League um­ pire Marty Springstead, a member of the umpires’ negotiating committee, warned that if the dispute “ is not set­ tled next week, we could be in trou­ ble.’’ 
Springstead said he was “ going down to the meeting thinking this will be settled. I think if we can get over a couple of hurdles we can make it.” 
Amateur umpires will be used if no agreement has been reached when ex­ hibition games begin in two weeks. 
The leagues have said they will not bring in minor league umpires as they did during the National League playoffs a few years ago when the um­ pires refused to cross picket lines during a strike of stadium personnel. 
The 48 major league umpires re­ ceived telegrams from Presidents Lee 
MacPhail of the AL and Chub Feeney of the NL this week telling them not to report prior to a contract agreement 
“ to protect against incurring expenses which will not be reimbursable.” 
The umpires, whose contract ran out after the 1976 season, had said pre­ viously they would not report to the spring camps without at least the basis for an agreement. 
Salary 
The biggest stumbling block is sa­ lary, although AL umpires also are opposed to a plan to reduce umpiring crews from four men to three, plus one swing crew, because the league is ex­ panding from 12 teams to 14 this sea­ son. The umpires want the AL staff increased instead. 
It was learned the umpires are con­ sidering two proposals. 
One would put the minimum starting salary at $16,oo6 with mandatory in­ creases of $1 .DOO in each of the first five years. $1,25o in each of the next five years and $1,5oo each year thereafter to a top salary of around $45,ooo. 
The other proposal would start at 
$16,5oo with jumps of $1,ooo in each of the first seven years. $1,25o in each of the next six years and $1,5oo a year thereafter to a top of around $46.oo(1 or 
$47,ooo 
Minimum 
Last year's minimum starting salary was $15,5oo. The umpires originally asked for a starting minimum of 
$21,5oo with an annual raise of $1,5oo over the first nine years, then going to 
$3.IKM). 
The two leagues also rejected a pro­ posal by the umpires to establish a 
$25o.ooh pool in lieu of individual pay* mcnts fur World Series, playoff and 
AllStar Games. The money would have been given to the umpires association for dispersal as it saw fit. At present, umpires receive $9,5oo for the World 
Series, $5,5oo for playoffs and $1,25o for the All-Star Game. 
Also to be settled are per diem ex­ penses during the season and pay scale for post-season games, the All-Star 
Game and in-season exhibitions.

Twinbill 

Phillips, which opened its season with the twin­ bill. got two runs in the first off Tig ers’ Pat 
Walsh (1-1). The H ay­ makers parlayed two hits, two walks, an error and a passed ball into two runs. 

The Tigers came back in the second when Tom 
Haber doubled. Dave 
Calderon singled. Jim 
Summerset! singled and 
Bill Von Behren ground­ ed into a fielder’s choice. 
An error by P h illip s ’ center fielder. Wes Hurl- butt, also helped even the score at 2-2. 

Trinity scored another run in the fourth without a hit. Three walks and two errors produced the 
TU run. But Greg Skaggs even the game with a fifth-inning home run. 

“ I was having trouble with my slider and my curve,” na id Walsh, de­ scribing his first-inning problems. “ So, I went with my fast hall, it was working really well. 

Slider 

“ That homer in the fifth was on a slider that got away. I think if my curve and slider had been working, we would have won easier.” 

The 
Tigers had chances to win the con­ test in regulation, but left runners stranded til the fifth, sixth and seventh innings. 
In the game 
Trinity left 12 men on basyv 

The Tigers, who will play another double­ header with Phillips Sa­ turday at I p m., were never in the second game, dropping fixe runs behind in the first inning. 
Skaggs had four R B ls, and Jim Hart tallied five, plus two homers, for 
Phillips.

N LRB is walking tight line 

B> DAVID M C LEM O R E 

There eau be no hopi' for a society unconcerned 
'.villi its dissatisfied members, a National Labor 
Relations Hoard m em ber told businessmen Friday. 
He said the NLRB is w alking a tight line to preserve the rights of all parties. 
Howard Jenkins .lr the first l>la«*k appointed to the NLRB. was guest speaker to the Southwest Texas 
( hapter of the Texas Assn. of Business at the Bright 
Shawl. HP) Augusta St. 

Opposing principles 

“ There are two diam etrically opposing principles on which this country is founded,” Jenkins said. 

“ The first is m a jo rity rule; the second, that of ind ividu al freedom. The governm ent's place is to strike a balance iii the conflict of these tw o p rin ci­ ples.” 
Jenkins said the NLRB strives to strike that ba­ lance so as not to interfere w ith the rights of em ­ ployes nor prevent industry leaders from m aking necessary business decisions. 
“ Of m ajor concern to me is whether it is proper for a federal agency such as the NLRB to require an employe! to certify a union fo r collective bargaining w Iii'ii that union is descrim inatory iii membership recruitm ent 
“ In a Texas case three Nears ago. the NLRB voted 
J-2 that such certification would not be appropriate. 

Radio-Thon to aid leukemia victims 

San Antonio's first annual Leukemia Radio-Thon w ill run from 5 p.m. Saturday to 5 p.m. Sunday on 
KITE-Radio. 
The Radio-Thon. which w ill be one of 5o conducted sim ultaneously across the U.S., w ill include musical entertainment and interviews w ith San Antonio and 
I lolly wood persona titles. 
A ll proceeds w ill go to leukemia research

ASSOCIATED PRISS 
F ire w arnings were issued by the 
National W eather Service F rid a y as strong winds lashed the state and fo r­ est and grass fires swept through East 
Texas. 
The la rg e s t fire was re p o rte d between Upshur and M arion C ounty where* m ore than 2o(1 a cres w ere reported burning. 
A cold front moved into the s ta ll 
Friday, bringing gusty winds to West 

Texas. A high wind w arning fo r the mountain passes of Southwest Texas was issued w ith gusts exceeding 7o miles per hour. 

Strong southerly winds gusting to 3o miles per hour blew over east Texas in advance of the approaching front. Low hum idity values for the past several days in that area have left grasslands arid forests extre m e ly d ry .

 i Volkswagen still 
§ m aking Beetles 

I am always surprised when so­ meone asks if Volkswagen is still building the Beetle. Of course they are, and, yes, if you want one, you can buy a brand new one right off the showroom floor. 

Volkswagen plants in Germany. Bel­ gium. Mexico. Brazil and one in South 
Africa are still turning out Beetles by the thousands. 
Although most of the sales effort in this country is going into the Rabbit, there is still some demand for Beetles. The con­ vertible Beetle is still very popular. 
The VW Beetle has held the honor of the world's champion for sheer numbers of ears built since it surpassed the Model T. 
Henry Ford built more than 15 million Ts; the 15th million Beetle was built in 1972 
Volkswagen management is not too happy with its Mexico production. They have been saying they would like to close down their plant in Puebla. They say there is no profit in building the cars for sale in Mexico. Last I heard they were still talking with the Mexican government about upping the price.

SPECIAl TO THC IXPRCSS N EW S 

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - The 
Camaro Z-28, one of the best know n specialty ears of the past decade, is being reintroduced to the public following a two-year absence from 
Chevrolet dealer showrooms, 
Robert I). Lund, Chevrolet general manager and a General Motors vice pre­ sident. made the announcement at a spe­ cial preview 
‘‘We firmly believe the Z-28 may well prove to be the best handling production vehicle ever built,” said Lund, “ and that it will set a new standard for production cars of the future. We haven’t compared it to all of the foreign cars in detail, hut we have no reason to believe there is a better handling vehicle anywhere." 
Suspension 
The new Z-28 suspension doesn't know speed, said Lund, meaning that it handles equally well in either low or high speed ranges, making it both predictable and responsive at all times and over all types of road surface. 
Lund stated that unprecedented de­ mand for the Camaro and recent changes in the specialty vehicle market made the decision to reactivate the Z-28 obvious to 
Chevrolet planners months ago. 
“ The Camaro Z-28 is intended for the macho enthusiast,” he said. “ It is a driver's ear. Today, the enthusiast wants 

 designed using special GK7o-I5 steel belted radial tires and 15x7 iii wheels. 
Development engineers changed the front and rear stabilizer hat s, spring rales, rear spring shackles and shock valving to provide halt c t h I , linear handling i i i all driv lug modes. 
More precise steering is also accum- 
•dished bv reducing the steering ratio from IK I lo 14 I 
Colors 
Z-28 appearance treatment includes front and rear spoilers, and body colored bumpers, rallye wheels and sport m ir­ rors. 
Complementing the seven available ex­ terior colors are specific Z-28 accent de­ cals for the hood, front fender, front and rear spoiler, wheel opening and rocker panel 
“ Z-28” decals adorn the grille, rear end panel and front fenders. 
Black painted grille, rear end panel, parking and headlamp bezels, and black front and rear reveal and wheel opening moldings are also used 
According to Lund, initial Z-28 produc­ tion will be at an annual rate of 2o*25.(NHI units, but could be adjusted considerably higher to suit demand. Total 1977 Camaro model year production is estimated al 
2o5.ooo units 
Production of the sporty coupe began 
Fob I The first public display will be at the 
Chicago 
Auto 
Show, opening 
Saturday. 
Camaro Z-28 manufacturer suggested retail price is $5,17o OO.

 a special breed of aspiration ear. Ile wants a car with functional sophistication and with finesse. IR* wants his car to he aggressive, quick, agile and dependable, lie* is very critical and we welcome his appraisal of the Z-28.” 
The new Z-28 offers as standard equip­ ment a 35o cu. in 4bb|. carburetor V-8 engine and a 4-speed heavy-duty Borg 
Warner transmission with an ll in high capacity clutch and 2.o4 first gear ratio A high shift point 3-speed automatic trans­ mission is optional Rear axle ratio with the manual transmission is 3.73 I aud with the automatic, 3.42.1. 
; 
Power output 
More efficient power output is achieved with an open exhaust system using dual resonators in place of mufflers. This re­ duces exhaust system back pressure by 49 per cent at 4,(KHI rpm. 
‘‘Refined shock absorbers, rather than the traditional heavy-duty type, help maintain wheel control on hard, rough corners,' said Lund "This, combined with higher spring rates, helps to mini­ mize driver bounce and fatigue usually associated with sport-type vehicles, par­ ticularly on lone freeway trios.” 
Suspension system components were 

 customer s place in designing our cars,” 
Macadam pointed out. "With the Chrysler 
LeBaron. we feel we have reached a new level in demonstrating our concern for the driver and his passengers. Never before have we been able to include so many features contributing to convenience and comfort in a car this size. 
“ Our over-all goal was an expression of good taste. We resisted anything that might appear to be add-on, an afterth­ ought, or garish in appearance. The result is an extremely well-organized car." 

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS N EW S 
DETROIT — LeBaron is back. 
The name that graced the luxury 
Chrysler Imperial now appears on 
Chryslers new mid-size cars. 

The big differences are that the new 
LeBaron is about 1.39o pounds lighter, uses the smallest of Chrysler s V-8 en­ gines. and is roomier in key interior di­ mensions even though the car's exterior is considerably smaller. 
Chrysler engineers developed the new 
LeBaron to be a smaller, more fuel-elfi- eient ear as well as a ear with the perfor­ mance. ride qualities and elegance of a larger luxury automobile — a car with the latest features in electronics and sound reduction. 
“ The Chrysler LeBaron has the highest level of comfort, luxury and convenience of any ear in this new class of elegant mid-size automobiles." according to Ri­ chard G. Macadam. Chrysler Corp.’s vice president for design.

(front seat legroom. 

Engineers literally started at ground level to specify luxury-ear riding qua­ lities. The suspension, designed for use with radial-ply tires, reduces vibration and contributes to a smooth ride. 

Chrysler offers for the first time on the 
LeBaron optional 15-inch styled forged aluminum road wheels. The new alumin­ um wheel is about two pounds lighter than a comparable steel wheel. 

Standard equipment 
To achieve the quiet operation in keep­ ing with its luxury image, the new 
Chrysler LeBaron uses an isolated trans- 

G overnm ent rules cosily 
The cost of government regulation ac­ tually comes to about $2(1o a car at Gen­ eral Motors. 
This includes the whole spectrum, not just emissions, and the bill for the last two calendar years at GM figures out to 
$2.25 billion. 

 verse torsion bar suspension system with a number of body and suspension noise- reducing components. 

The new LeBaron offers as standard equipment a 318 cubic-inch displacement 
V-8 engine with two-barrel carburetor. It is equipped with the most recent im­ provements in the Electronic Lean Burn 
System — a second-generation spark control computer with new integrated circuitry and distributor pick-up for im­ proved reliability and performance. 

Chrysler introduced Lean Burn to the" industry in 1976. Lean Burn uses sensors and a small underhood analog computer to electronically control the timing of spark plug firing. 

The system is called Lean Burn because it allows a leaner air-to-fuel ratio than the more conventional mixture of 16 pounds of air to one pound of fuel. The Electronic- 
Lean Burn System is designed to reduce emissions, and to improve performance, driveabilitv and fuel economy. 

The improved Lean Burn System is standard equipment, as are automatic- transmissions, a 2.76 economy axle ratio. power steering and power front disc brakes. 

Patton is named 
Rieger service chief 

D.W. 
Patton has been named service manager for the Jack Rieger Chrysler- 
Plymouth dealership. 

The appointmeni of Patton was 

 announced by S. Jack Kieger, pre­ sident and general manager of Jack 
Rieger Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. 

Both Rieger and Patton have de­ dicated themselves to greater customer satisfaction in 1977. 

Their goals include increased 

 quality in automotive repairs, in­ creased efficiency for faster repairs and extremely competitive repair prices. 

In addition to automotive repairs 

 on ail Chrysler and Plymouth cars, the dealership provides body and paint shop services, headed by foreman J. McMillan. 

The dealership also has a com­ plete stock of parts and accessories. 
Also available are new and used cars to satisfy the selective buyer.

 car, like the Oldsmobile 98 Regency. would be $175, plus $12 labor. 
The converters are designed to have a life span of 5o.ooo miles which means that a lot of people will be. or should be. re­ placing the emissions cleaning devices. 
Since a lot of people will not spend that much money easily, there will certainly have to be regulations and inspections to see that the converters are replaced when they are no longer functional.

Minivan 
Was asked the other day how long does it take to get a new car from the drawing boards to production. 
It varies, of course, but generally about three years. American Motors came up with the original Gremlin in a swift 18 months, but that was an exception. 
Right now General Motors has on its drawing boards, or I should say in its design computers, an idea for a series of a small vehicles for 198o. And these are only design concepts. 
There seems to be little doubt that GM will have a front wheel drive mini-car by 
198o. There may even be some new ideas on the types of vehicles to be offered — like a mini-van? 
In the next five years the four U.S. au­ tomakers will spend about $28 billion to redesign their cars from top to bottom. 

They’re doing it mainly to meet me upcoming federal mileage standards and other government regulations. General 
Motors will spend $15 billion. Ford SIO billion. Chrysler more than $3 billion and 
American Motors less than a billion. 
About 6(1 per cent will go for tooling and the remaining 4(1 per cent w ill be spent on refurbishing and expanding facilities. 
The job of finding the money and dis­ bursing it primarily belongs to three executive vice presidents. They are opti­ mistic about finding such a huge amount of money. 
There are three principle sources for the money. Most will come from depre­ ciation and amortization, and the rest from profits. And if necessary they can lwrrow whatever is needed to keep things going. 
Last year GM borrowed $86o million to help finance its downsizing program. 
However, the Big Three say they are not going to borrow money in the future for their car designs. 
A utom obiles easy on energy 

The automobile, often assumed to be an easy target for a lion's share of needed national energy conservation, accounts for only 13 per cent of the nation’s energy usage.

It costs money to stop using

Engineers criticized on aquifer 

San Antonio engineers have failed to assert themselves within the political decision-making arena. “ Engineer of the 
Year" Carl Raba Jr. said 
Friday night. 
“ What has been your technical and social posi­ tion with respect to clean water and the Edwards 
Aquifer?” asked Raba, in a speech as he accepted the J977 “ Engineer of the 
Year Award” at Canyon 
Creek Country Club. 
"Em not pleased with many of the things that are happening now. and you may not be also. But, did you do anything to prevent untrained, unex­ perienced, non-experts from turning it into per­ haps the most emotional

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LONDON — They called her 
“ Annie Oakley,” “Auntie Sam” and London's “ Rose of Texas” when she arrived here a year ago. 
Now Anne Armstrong is preparing to leave her post as U.S. ambassador to 
Britain, and by all accounts she has been one of the most successful and popular American envoys here in years 
“ There must be something wrong with somebody whom everybody likes,” Uh* attractive 49-year-old lady from Texas said Friday in a farewell interview. 
British press 
The warmth with which she has been treated by the British press, which normally attacks first and asks questions later, exemplifies the feelings most Britons have for Amer­ ica’s first woman ambassador to the 
Court of St. James’s. 
“ My support in the United States presidential election will go to which­ ever of the candidates promises lo keep her in London.” was the way The 
Times Diary, a daily column in Lon­ don's influential Times newspaper, put it last May. 
When the novelty of having a woman ambassador from Texas who was reputed to bo a crack shot wore off, the press stopped calling her "The Wild 
West Lady” and started calling her 
“ poised and beautiful.” 
She returned the compliments, telling the British what they, in the midst of tough economic and social 
P ro p e rty tax w ould double by proposal 

Property taxes would more than double in San Antonio if a hill elimin­ ating revenue paid to the city by City 
Public Service passes the legislature. 
City Finance Dir. Carl White said the city expects to collect about $37 million this year from CPS which makes pay­ ments to the city instead of paying taxes like a private utility would. 
"lf we lost $37 million, we d have to recover that money from some other source," White said. “ So property taxes would more than double ” 
The city government depends heav i- ly on CPS payments and properly taxes to finance the annual budget 
White pointed out that nearly a third of the property in the city is tax-ex­ empt, such us schools arid churches. 
So an even heavier burden would fall on property taxpayers lf the hill passes because tax-exempt organizations do pay utilities 
Slate Rep, Don Cartwright intro­ duced the bill earlier this week to prohibit CPS from making payments to the city. Another bill would reduce the amount paid to CPS by tax-exempt organizations

ANNE ARMSTRONG 
. . . likes Britain 

 problems, desperately needed to hear. 
“ We believe in you,” she told them. 
“ We need you, and you will endure.” 
“ I think they sensed that Anni 
Armstrong liked this country.” she said. “ I like and res|>ect and have faith in them.” 
Compliments 
She traveled around the country and found something to compliment wher­ ever she was. She told Manchester, a typical industrial city, she liked the 
"solidity of the buildings." 
She called Edinburgh, the historic capital of Scotland, "a strong, hand­ some city." The Scots, in turn, called her “ vivacious and vital.” 
She traveled to war-torn Northern 
Ireland to tell the residents of Belfast they had “ true grit.” 
“ I think it needed to he said,” said 
Mrs. Armstrong, whit will he returning 
March 3 to her home in Armstrong. 
Texas, exactly a year to the day since she arrived here. 
"The long-term proepects for this country are very good," she said. "The political institutions .ire in basically sound shape. That and the strength of her people are why this country cannot fail. 
But the British “ have a couple of rough years ahead of them," she said. and must meet a number of tests, among them can they hold the line against inflation, now running at 1H.B per cent annually; will they find a way not to chase away the best people; and can they erase still-apparent vestiges ot an old class system? 
“ I don’t know what I’m going to do," she said of her future. "I don’t rule out running for office. I ’ll keep up my in­ terest in politics in some way." 

Fatal gunshot wound probed 

A medical examiner s ruling is pending in tile shooting death Friday of an elderly man. 
Police identified the victim as Jessie 
Diaz Santos, 67, of IHI! Mayfield Blvd 
Ile was pronounced dead ot a gun­ shot wound to the head at 3 47 p m 
Police said the man was found inside

A 22 caliber pistol was found near the victim, police said.

 hoard, so I think it’s pretty important we fol­ low their recommenda­ tions,” lie added. 
Main goal 
The main goal of the three-month long study would be to determine whether it would he cheaper for the city and county to lease office space or construct a building. 
The committee also in­ tends to determine the total amount of office space the county and city are currently leasing. 
M cAllister said the committee has been de­ layed in completing its investigation because the city was without a per­ manent city manager for several months. 
Commissioners Court has already voted to build a combination of­ fice building and parking garage across the street from the Courthouse on 
South Main Avenue 
Await report 
Judge Reeves said the court will probably wait until the committee re­ turns it report before se­ lecting an architect for the annex. 
He added the court will take official action on the 
9o-day delay next week. 

Locke criticizes 
Krueger 

Bobby Locke, the 1976 
Republican nominee for 
Congress from District 
21, Friday faulted U.S. 
Rep. Bob Krueger for failure to vote against the 
$13.(MKI pay raise for con­ gressmen. 
Congress. 
Locke charged, backed into the pay raise wLthnut voting for it. The raise, effective last weekend, became law when Congress fulled to take any action to block it. 
On Feb. 21. Locke said, 
Krueger said he received 
15o letters from consti­ tuents opposing the raise, with no letters iii favor of it. Krueger, he added, chose not to listen to the will of the people. 
Locke has announced he will be a candidate for the 21st District post again in 1978. 

 this city has ever seen .' ’ Raba stated. 
Haha said the talents and skill of professional engineers are needed by political decision­ makers. 
. . when I see engin­ eering-oriented decisions being made by political bodies, I ask where are the engineers with their expertise? 
"The only thing I see are unruly groups that are not qualified . . who are providing irrational and emotional argu­ ments that are leading our society towards dis­ aster.” Raba said. 
Nuclear 
Raba also said engineers should have supported the city s en­ trance into the South 
Texas Nuclear Project. 
“ Rationally, technical­ ly and scientifically, the nuclear power plant does not pose an uncontrolled danger to m ankind,” said Raba. 
“ Where were you se­ veral years ago. when our City Public Service hoard through the far­ sightedness of engineers like Tom Berg, Jack 
Spruce and Jess Poston fought against almost overwhelming odds to make us partners in the 
South Texas Nuclear 
Project." 

Raba was named 1977 
Engineer of the Year by the 
Bexar 
County 
Chapter of Professional 
Engineers. 

Haha, who is un officer in Raba & Associate En­ gineering consultant firm , was also named 
“ Young Engineer of the 
Year" in 197o. 

He is a former presi­ dent of the Northside 
School Board.
