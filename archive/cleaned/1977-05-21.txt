Federal authorities late Friday were still hunting for eight people charged with m isap p ly in g funds from the now-defunct Citizens State Bank in 
Carrizo Springs. 
Five people named in two sealed indictm ents retu rn ed by a federal grand jury T hursday have already been apprehended by FBI agents. 
Death sentence is given 
McManus 

By JERR Y DEAL 
OF THE EXPRESS-NEW S STAFF 
HOUSTON — A death s e n ­ tence was given Vernon Eugene 
M cManus by a. jury Friday evening, after 3V2 hours of deli­ beration. 

The former San Antonio MacArthur 
High School football coach had been found guilty by the jury Thursday of capital m urder in connection with the d eath of Baytow n c o n tra c to r P aul 
Cantrell and his wife. 
McManus was nervous and pale as the nine men and three women went to the jury box before handing the eourt bailiff the decision. 
However, he looked each of the ju r­ ors in the eye while they were being polled individually about th e ir d e ­ cision. The other choice was to give 
McManus life in prison. 
Formal sentencing by District Judge 
I. D. McMaster will be May 31. 
Testimony 

Key testimony was presented earlier in the day at a hearing on the punish­ ment phase by a form er girlfriend. 
Mrs. Joyce St. Clair, 36, testified 
MacManus had threatened to have a hit man from Dallas kill her husband. 
Asst. Dist. Atty. Mike Hinton said after the trial that even if McManus should reveal the nam es of others, now unknown, who m ig h t have been in­ volved in the m u rd e rs he would not seek a lesser sentence. 
“ You just don't tam per with a ju ry ’s sentence; we (the district attorney’s office) don't work that way,” he said. 
Hinton said he thought it was a good decision and saw no reversible errors. 
H ow ever, d e fe n se a tto rn e y Don 
Smith said he believes there were a number of reversible errors. Ut' said the defense w ill file a motion for a new trial within the designated 1o-day per­ iod and if that is denied, he will appeal the decision to the Court of Criminal 
Appeals. 
“ Mr. McManus has m aintained his 

Motorcyclists can junk helmets soon 

AUSTIN (AP) - Gov. Dolph Briscoe signed a bill Friday that will allow motorcycle riders over 18 to go without a protective helmet if they want. 
The bill goes into effect 9o days after the legislature adjourns in IO days. 

But agents are still looking for the bank's former owner, Enrique Salinas, m em bers of his family and form er officers and customers of the bank, which was closed last June by state banking authorities. 

One indictment charges 12 people with co nspiring to m isap p ly bank- funds and to make false entries in the 

 bank’s books with intent to defraud the bank. 
The second in d ic tm e n t a c cu s e s fo rm e r bank p r e s id e n t 
R ic h a rd 
George, 31, of Carrizo Springs, of misapplying $39,ooo in bank funds and then making a false entry about the money in the bank’s books. 
George was freed on a $5o,ooo bond 
Friday. 

Also freed Friday, on a personal recognizance bond, was former bank chairman Urban Farrow, 73, also of 
Carrizo Springs. 
But still in Bexar County Jail in lieu of bonds were Hon Guess, 36, of 8619 
Wexford Drive, and Blanca Alicia do 
Aldaca, 39. and Bicknell Eubanks III, both of Eagle Pass. 
Guess was identified by U.S. Atty. 

John E. Clark as a former executive vice president of the bank. De Aldaca is 
Salinas’ cousin. 
Eubanks is a 
U.S. Customs Service inspector. 
Agents are still seeking Salinas; Ins wife, Gretchen Salinas; form er Citi­ zens State president Lewis Woodul; former cochairman Dan Sanchez Jr.; 
Salinas’ brother, Luis Salinas; and 
Salinas’ brother-in-law, Jose L. Flores. 

Also sought are At llano de la Garza, a rancher from Muzquez, Mexico, and the foreman of his ranch, Jesus Davis. 
All 12 people named in the conspir­ acy indictment are charged with one or m ore counts of m isapplying bank funds.

A Frio County constable and an oil field worker from Pear­ sall have been jailed in connec­ tion with an alleged plot to rob the Dilley State Bank.

Fellow officers:

COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES 
SEOUL — Maj. Gen. John 
Singlaub’s fellow officers said privately Friday that they agree with his claim that President 
Carter’s plan to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea will lead to war. 
“ Everyone here thinks what he said was rig h t.” said one officer at head­ quarters of U.S. forces in Korea. 
H ow ever, the offic ers refu sed to m ake their feelings known publicly in the fear they will suffer a fate similar to that of Singlaub, who was sum ­ moned home abruptly for a meeting with the President at the White House. 
Singlaub, who arrived late Friday in 
Washington wearing civilian clothes, would not d is c u s s th e issu e w ith new sm en, saying he would not co m ­ ment until after he meets with Carter. 
And retired Gen. Richard Stilwell, who chose Singlaub as chief of staff in 
Korea, indicated he agrees generally with S in g la u b ’s a s s e s s m e n t of the troop w ithdraw al, but said Singlaub has to be prepared to take the conse­ q u e n c es for p u b lic ly c h a lle n g in g

Spirit II retraces 1927 route o f Lone Eagle 

ROOSEVELT, N.Y. (AP) - Like a ghost from the past, a tiny silver sister ship of the Spirit of St. Louis flew over what was once Roosevelt Field, m a rk ­ ing the 5oth a n n iv ersa ry F rid a y of 
Charles Lindbergh’s takeoff into avia­ tion immortality. 
The Spirit of St. Louis IL w ith Jam es 
Pyle of Oy ster Bay at the controls, took off from G ru m m an a irp o rt at 7:52 a.m., the precise m om ent that Lind­ bergh gunned the original Spirit of St. 
Louis into motion that misty morning 

 on May 2o, 1927. 
Lindbergh, then 25, took off from an airfield that is now the site of a shop­ ping center. About 6oo persons g a th ­ ered there Friday to watch the flyover of Pyle’s aircraft, escorted by 3o other antique planes, while a choir san g

Like the “ Spirit of St. Louis" 5o years ago, the “ Spirit of San Antonio” will be landing in Paris Saturday after a solo trip across the Atlantic Ocean.

“ It was absolutely perfect,” added 
Frogge, now an assistant to the p re­ sident of Roosevelt Raceway, a trotting race track which occupies part of the old airfield. “ The plane looked so small compared to the planes of today. 
At that time I used to think it was so big. It brought back everything.” 
Tributes 
Pyle’s flight was one in a series of tributes com m em orating Lindbergh s 
3 3 Va-hour solo flight to Le B ourget 
A irport in P a ris , the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic by air. 
In England, a q u arte t of aviation enthusiasts scheduled a flight S atu r­ day from the World War ll fighter base at Biggin Hill to Le Bourget in a rented wartime Bl7 Flying Fortress, to mark the anniversary of Lindbergh's landing in France at 1o:24 p.m. May 21.

Tower's garbage showers on rides 

By JIM WOOD 

George Lane says the Tower of the A m ericas is dum ping on him. Still. 

Bill H o ltz in g e r say s i f s tru e. 
“ George gets it som etim es.’’ 

Lane owns George Lane Enterprises which operates the carnival rides al 
HemisFair Plaza. 
Holtzinger is the assistant m anager of the Convention C enter, w hich is partly responsible for operation of the tower. 

What Lane gets is grease, detergent and an occasional serv in g of peas, carrots and other assorted vegetables. 
He g ets th e m on h im self, his customers and his kiddy rides. 

Holtzinger says the problem is one of long and high standing. From the day it was b uilt, the T ow er of the 
Americas, which houses a restaurant. had inadequate plumbing, he says. 

Backs up 

Despite modifications from time to tim e, the sy stem still c a n ’t handle peak loads, he says. “ We’ve tried and tried to correct it.” 
But grease and other such garbage still backs up through the traps and overflows on heavy use days. T hat's when Lane gets it. “ You can see it falling in a stream and I have pictures to prove it.’’ 
As a resu lt, he says som e of his customers find spots on their clothes. 
“ And detergent gets on the merry-go- round and the bumper cars. It eats into my paint and I have to repaint a couple of tim es a year. It’s cost me 
$3o,ooo to $35,ooo.” 
Mel Sueltenfuss, assistant director of 
Public Works, which has maintenance responsibility, says he will take a new look at the problem.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday May 2 I I 977 
Lester has finally got his act together 

Remember 
Lester Maddox, the former Georgia governor who once closed his restaurant rather than submit to integration? 

Well, he’s putting together a night club act, and his partner is a black ex-convict. 
The act is called “ The Governor and the Dishwasher.” It stars 
Maddox, governor of Georgia in 
1967-7o, and Bobby Lee Sears, who once did time on a narcotics conviction and later was a busboy in 
Maddox’s Atlanta restaurant. 
Maddox said in Sanford, Fla., he has wanted to be in show business 
“ ever since I was a child. I ve al­ ways wondered why people get paid 
— sometimes quite a lot — for act­ ing just as we feel and live.” - 
The opening at Mr. P.’s supper club in Sanford originally was scheduled for Sunday but was post­ poned in hopes of attracting a big­ ger crowd. 

Bob Patrick, a spokesman for the supper club, said Maddox and 
Sears will do a “ down home” co­ medy routine built around musical numbers — backed up by a small band. Maddox plays a harmonica. 
Sears a guitar. 
Sears said he “ loves the gover­ nor” and thinks Maddox loves him, too. 
“ The first contact I had with him, he was trying to get a transfer from a penal institution,” Maddox said of 
Sears. “ He couldn’t get it through the governor’s office.” 
But as lieutenant governor, Mad­ dox said he helped him get the transfer. 
Lampoon: 

S t a r is stillborn 

The Harvard Lampoon has de­ clared “ A Star Is Born” the worst picture of the year, and its star. 
Barbra Streisand, worst actress. 
Announcing the results of a poll 
Friday, the Harvard University campus humor magazine said 
“ Star” won by thousands of votes over “ The Enforcer” and earned its condemnation “ for attempting to pass off Barbra Streisand as a singer.” 
However, 
Glint Eastwood won the Kirk Douglas Award for Worst 
Actor for his performance in “ The 
Enforcer.” The Lampoon suggested for Eastwood's portrayal of a brutal cop he “ ought to be beaten sense- leeslv with a cudgel or blunt in­ strument of some kind.” 
Miss Streisand will receive the 

Natalie Wood 
Award for Worst 
Actress.

Agriculture award given to professors 

Two scientists who work in a little-known but important field, research in insect chemical com­ munication, have won the Alex­ ander von Humboldt Foundation 
Award of $1o,ooo, given to persons who have made the most significant contribution to American agricul­ ture in a one to three-year period. 
The award was presented on the 
Ithaca campus of Cornell University to Dr. Wendell Koeloffe, professor of insect biochemistry, and Dr. 
Harry II. Shorey, professor of entomology and biology at the Uni­ versity of California at Riverside. 
The twit agricultural scientists were cited tor their work which could lead to the use of sex attrac­ tants for the control of insects that are damaging crops. 

LESTER M A D D O X and Bobby Lee Sears rehearse 
Margaret’s happier than ever before 

Margaret Trudeau, 
Canada’s 
First Lady, told companions at a dinner in Washington, D.C., that she is really en joying her new role as a professional photographer. 
Mrs. Trudeau confided to a com­ panion that the switch in her li­ festyle has made her happier than she has ever been, the Washington 
Star reported Friday. 
Mrs. Trudeau was attending the annual White House News Photo­ graphers Association dinner with a 

 group from People magazine, which employes her as a free-lance photographer. 
The Star said Mrs. Trudeau shook hands and chatted, but declined to be interviewed. . . 

John Dominis, chief photo­ grapher for People, indicated he was pleased with her work. 
“ She’s serious about photo­ graphy,” Dominis said. “ And if she works at it, she could be quite a photographer.’.’

R. Vance and Soviet Fo­ reign Minister Andrei A. 
Gromyko. 
Vance was restrained but appeared to be in an upbeat mood as he re­ turned to his hotel from the final session at the 
Soviet mission to work on a communique that will be issued Saturday. 
“ The talks have been very useful as far as we are concerned and I believe that view7 is shared by the Soviets as well,” he said. 
Earlier in the day he telephoned President 
Carter. 
“ We are silent like fish.” Gromyko told reporters as the final meeting began. 
In Washington, White 
House officials said the talks produced progress and “ hopeful indica­ tions.” A Carter aide said, “ Serious negotia­ tions have commenced. A tit-for-tat process is under way. Our view that this is a long and com­ plicated process has not changed.” The talks were a turnabout from negotiations last March in Moscow when the 
Kremlin leaders rejected 
Vance’s proposals for a new treaty placing limits on long-range bombers and intercontinental missiles. 
The Carter aide told reporters: “ You’re right in viewing this with a degree of optimism.” 
But he emphasized that points of disagreement remained and that “ it all hangs together. There will be no pulling out of three of IO points of agreement and ratifying those and negotiating” the others. 

White House Press 
Secretary Judy Powell said. “ We’ve had useful, we’ve had productive talks.” 
But. he said, “ it would be wrong to assume that there has been some sudden culmination” of the negotiating process. 
Vance is expected to provide some details of the negotiating frame­ work when he holds a news conference Satur­ day before flying home to Washington. 
Informed sources said the two sides had agreed to blend the American proposals with a Soviet offer. 
They said the final re­ sult probably w ill include a reduction of arsenals on both sides, some restric­ tions on U.S. cruise missiles and the Russian 
Backfire bomber and a mutual commitment to negotiate more substan­ tial weapons cutbacks. 
Presentation of the 
American proposals in 
March on a take-it-or- leave-it basis combined with President Carter’s outspoken support for human rights in the 
Soviet Union had created a strain between the two superpowers. 
Moscow insisted the only basis for an agreement was the 
Vladivostok pact signed in 1974 between Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and former President 
Gerald Ford. That treaty expires Oct. 3. 
It set a ceiling of 2,4oo strategic delivery vehi­ cles for each side with a 
1.32o-subceiling for missiles carrying in­ dependently targetable warheads.

Gen. Hershey, former draft director, dies 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ANGOLA, Ind. — Lewis Blaine Hershey, a retired general who supervised the draft of 14.5 million Americans in three wars, died 
Friday in this rural Indiana town near where he was born. He was 
83. 
His body was taken to Et. Benjamin 
Harrison at Indianapolis, which is serving as the Army’s headquarters for processsing Vietnam-era deserters out of the military. 
An autopsy was scheduled at the family's request to determine cause of death. The body was to be flown later to Washington for burial at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
Hershey, an Indiana farm boy who rose through the ranks from private to four-star general and headed the 
Selective Service System for almost 3o years, was found dead in bed by his son, Marine Col. Gilbert Hershey. 
Authorities said he apparently died in his sleep about 6 a m. in the motel where he and his son had spent the night. 
Memorial 

Hershey was to have attended graduation exercises Saturday at his alma mater, Tri-State University, where a memorial to him is being created. 
Hershey served under six presidents. 
He was a hero to many Americans and a villain to others. He received some of the highest honors awarded by the military and veterans groups, but during the Vietnam war was the target of critics who demanded his resigna­ tion as the draft chief. Sen. Eugene J. 
McCarthy, D-Minn., made him a pres­ idential campaign issue in 
1968, promising to fire him if elected, v 
“ America and the American Legion have lost a great friend,” said William 
J. Rogers, the Legion’s national commander. “ Gen, Hershey was a great patriot and military leader, and he gave much of his life in service to his country.” 
Hershey became draft director in 
1941 and was eased out in 197o by Pres­ ident Richard M. Nixon, who reas­ signed him as an adviser on manpower mobilization. Hershey retired in 1973 at age 79 — the oldest military man on active duty. 

He brushed off the criticism o f antiwar protesters, sav­ ings 'Someone has to play the goat, and I'm it' 

Hospital 
Hershey had been ill in recent months and was hospitalized at Walter 
Reed Army hospital in Washington after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on Feb. 2o. His wife, Ellen, who died recently at age 84, said during the hos­ pital stay, “ It seems when they have to quit the things they have been doing for many years, they just fold up.” 
Hershey was born Sept. 12. 1893, on a farm near Angola in Steuben County, 
Iud., the descendant of Swiss Mennon­ ites, who opposed war. 
He had a down-to-earth manner, once saying of himself, “ I am Mid­ western. I am the product of the type of farm between 6o and 16o acres.” 
He also was staunchly patriotic. 
“ Some people say America is sick,” he said, “ but I ’m beginning to believe that the people who say that arc the sick ones.” ll efirmly believed his work with the draft, though a thankless job, was V I­

 tai. “ What did George Washington spend most of his time doing? Looking for men,” he said. 
He brushed off the criticism of an­ tiwar protesters, saying “ Someone has til play the goat, and I ’m it.” Neverthe­ less. he called violent protesters “ en­ emies of the United States or stooges for the enemies of the United States.” 
In 1967, Hershey recommended that local draft boards reclassify and draft antiwar demonstrators who violate the law — a stance that critics viewed as using the draft as punishment for dis­ sent. 
Hershey began his military career in 
1911 as a private in the Indiana Na­ tional Guard, fighting Mexican border skirmishes. 
He became a second lieutenant in 
1913 and reached France in 1918 but was in a hospital with suspected diphtheria when the Armistice was signed a month later while his unit was still in training behind the front. 
By the time he returned home in 
1919, he decided to stay in the Army instead of resuming his fledgling car­ eer as a teacher. He joined the Regular 
Army as a captain in 192o and rose to be a general. 
Lost eye 

While stationed in Texas, at Ft. 
Bliss, he lost his right eye in a polo accident. 
Hershey took over the new Selective 
Service System when its first head, Dr. 
Clarence A. Dykstra, a civilian, left the job after six months and went back to his post as president of the University of Wisconsin. 
Vaccinated man is rabid 

ALBANY, N.Y. (A P) - A re­ searcher who thought he was immun­ ized against rabies — but now lies hos­ pitalized in serious condition — might have contracted the disease by in­ haling a vaccine he was experimenting with, officials say. 
But other than venturing a possible cause of how Dr. Jerome Andrulonis got rabies, health officials were still baffled Friday as to why his immun­ ization didn't work. 
Survivor 

Andrulonis is in serious condition here, but is expected to live. If so, he would become only the second Amer­ ican to survive rabies. 
“ I think we have a survivor in this case,” said Dr. James Tillotson, head of the Albany Medical Center’s Divi­ sion of Infectious Diseases. “ He is do­ ing well considering that he has rabies and the previous known fatality rate." 
The only known American survivor was a 6-year-old Ohio youngster, 
Matthew- Winkler, in 197o. He got the disease when bitten by a bat. Winkler is now a sixth grader in Lima and do­ ing well. 
Andrulonis apparently is the first person to have contracted the disease after being immunized. 
He is a senior researcher for the state Health Department who had been researching methods to immunize wild animals against the disease in hopes of reducing the possibility of their in­ fecting humans. 
Bites 
Rabies is usually transmitted by an­ imal bites, but officials said it can be transmitted through the air'and enter the body through sensitive mem­ branes, such as in the nose', or through wounds. 
Tillotson said this apparently was how Andrulonis became infected, alth­ ough other possibilities were not being ruled out. 
“ It probably was the vaccine strain that he inhaled, ” Tillotson said. “ But we can’t say for sure because he does work with animals all the time that have rabies." 
Symptoms of rabies include headaches, muscle spasms, and a painful or burning sensation or numb­ 

 ness at the site of infection. In its later stages, the disease often causes con­ vulsions before the victim loses cons­ ciousness. It is usually fatal within two weeks. 
Andrulonis was working on a new oral rabies vaccine which involved a particularly potent strain of the virus. 
The project, developed by the CDG, involved using an aerosol device to spray the vaccine onto sugar particles. 
Texas, two other states 
OK laetrile 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Gov. Dolph Briscoe and the gover­ nors of Arizona and Nevada signed bills Friday legalizing the manufac­ ture, use and sale of the controversial cancer treatment, laetrile. 
Their signatures doubled the number of states in which the sub­ stance, also known as vitamin Bl7, is legal. Alaska, Florida and Indiana had previously approved its use. 
The Food and Drug Administration has banned laetrile, an extract of apricot and peach pits. 
The American Cancer Society and the American Medical Assn. say laetrile is worthless as a cancer treat­ ment and contend it should be banned because some cancer patients will postpone the use of accepted nieans-of treatment to take laetrile. 

Mental peace 

Arizona Gov. Raul Castro said, 
“ There are some suffering from cancer who have turned to laetrile and swear it has helped them. Others are not so positive, but they at least have found mental peace with its use and they have found tremendous hope,” 
Nevada Gov. Mike O’Callaghan signed a bill which also made legal the use of gerovital, a procaine substance said to relieve depression in the elder­ ly. Gerovital is also banned in inter­ state commerce bv the FDA.

Senate passes school bill 

Racism charge hurled in doctor sentencing 

A S S O C IA T E D PRESS 
AUSTIN — The Senate passed 
Friday night an $82o-million school finance bill after first cutting additional aid for poorer districts from $248 million to 
$1o8 million. 
The bill now re tu rn s to the H ouse, which is ex pected to re je c t c h a n g e s m a d e by the S e n a te an d d e m a n d a conference com m ittee to work out the differences. 
S e n a to rs a p p ro v e d th e b ill, 28-3, a f t e r m a n y c lo s e v o te s on a m e n d ­ m en ts. It c u ts the a m o u n t local d i s ­ tricts m u st ra ise for the F o u n d a tio n 
School P ro g ra m from $562 m illion to

$9,o24, com pared with the p re s e n t $8 ,o o o , and seco nd - year teachers g etting $9,2o4. T he Sen­ ate also added an lith and 1 2 th y e a r to the longevity pay scale. 
The bill includes $ 1 1 o million m ore for m aintenance and operation and $ 1 1 m illion m o r e for t r a n s p o r t a t i o n . It reduces the pupil-teaeher ratio in kin­ dergarten through the th ird g ra d e to 
18.5 to I. 
Board nixed 
T h e S e n a te re f u s e d . 16-15, to put back in the bill a state p ro p e rty tax board after Sen. A. M. Aikin, D -P aris, the dean of the Senate, said se n a to rs would have a hard tim e ex plain ing to local tax boards why a state board had been created to supervise th em . 
“ You’re not going to send som ebody from Austin to tell us w h at to do in 
P a ris,” Aikin shouted. 
He said the senators could ask th ree property ap p raisers to go out to th eir homes and they would get b ack th re e different figures. “ E v ery b o d y know s this.” he said. It is better to leave a p ­ praising up to local boards, he said. 
Sen. Oscar Mauzy, D-Dallas, S enate sponsor of the bill, h a m m e red at the need for m o r e e q u a liz a tio n a id fo r poorer districts. R epeatedly, he asked 
Sen. Grant Jones, D-Abilene, if J o n e s ’ a m e n d m e n t to r e d u c e e q u a li z a ti o n gave less th an M au zy ’s bill to th ose who needed help the most, and m o re to rich districts. 
The 77 poorest districts, w hich have less than $5o,ooo worth of p ro p e rty for each student, would get only $86.5o per pu p il in e x t r a a id , c o m p a r e d w jth 
$1o2.7o under his bill, Mauzy said. 

Dispute 

T h e n ex t p o o r e s t d i s t r i c t s , w ith 
$5o,ooo to $8o,ooo worth of p ro p e rty for each student, would get $43 less per pupil u n d e r J o n e s ’ a m e n d m e n t , he said. These d is tric ts have a to tal of 
9oo,ooo students. 
J o n e s ’ s t r o n g e s t r e s p o n s e w a s , 
“ Senator. I'm continually a m a z e d at your ability to read those fig u re s off that ch art.” 
There are 2o9 districts that a re levy­ ing less than 2 o cents for each $ 1 o o in assessed valuation, M auzy said . T he state average is 5o cents. 
Jo nes’ am en d m en t provides tw ice as much help to these districts w ith low taxes as his bill, Mauzy said. 

“ Now who’s helping those who a re m a k in g a good faith effort a n d who isn’t? ” he asked.

’No deal’ on West Bank 

. COM PILED FROM WIRE SERVICES 
TEL AVIV - Mena- hem Begin, expected to be Israel’s next prime minister, said Friday the 
West Bank of the Jordan 
River should be consid­ ered an integral part of 
Israel, not an occupied territory lo be bargained away in peace negotia­ tions. 
Begin said the time has come to abandon “ terri­ torial compromise” and start to represent the 
West 
Bank as an 
“ inseparable component of Israeli sovereignty.” 
His statement in an in­ terview with Israeli tele­ vision signaled a major policy change from the 
Labor party administra­ tion, which had advocat­ ed negotiating return of

 war-won Arab lands in exchange for peace. 
Begin, whose rightist 
Likud coalition won 
Tuesday's elections, cri­ ticized “ this misleading term of territorial com­ promise” and said there was no point in talking about compromise be­ cause the Arabs always rejected it. 
The Interviewer said 
Begin s policy was ‘ not acceptable to Washing­ ton, not lo a single sena­ tor or administration of­ ficial.” 
Begin responded: “ Did any Israeli representa­ tive ever tell a single senator that Judea and 
Samaria should, by law, by justice, by right, be an inseparable part of Is­ raeli sovereignty?” 
I .S.-S. Africa 
Calks stalemate 

VIENNA, Austria - 
Vice President Waller F. 
Mondale and South Afri­ can Prime Minister John 
Vorster failed to resolve differences on South 
Africa’s race policies on 
Friday. Mondale warned that the United States would not come to South 
Africa’s defense if such policies touch off racial war. 
Winding up two days of talks in Vienna with the 
South African leader. 
Mondale told a news conference the two had agreed on black majority rule in South-West Africa 
— 
Namibia 
— and 
Rhodesia but said Vor­ ster had remained ada­ mant on his country’s policy of strict racial segregation, or aparth­ eid. 

Soviets extend fishing limits 

MOSCOW — The Soviet 
Union will extend its fishing limits in the Bar­ ents Sea to 2oo nautical miles effective May 25, 
Tass News Agency said 
Friday. 
The agency said this council of ministers de­ cision was “ a temporary measure designed to protect living resources and regulate fishing in the Barents Sea regions adjacent to the Soviet coastline,” 
These “ regions” in­ clude those around is­ lands belonging to the 
USSR. Tass said. The new zone would be mea­ sured from the same starting line as Soviet territorial waters.

Oil map theft is investigated 

HOUSTON (AP) - A federal grand jury is re­ ported to be investigating the theft of oil maps that led to lease sales at en­ ormous profits. 
The FBI and other fed­ eral authorities would not discuss the matter but other sources said the maps belonged to the 
Houston office of Union 
Oil Co. of California. 
The investigation was reported to center around a former Houston oil­ man, now out of the country, who was de­ scribed by a business as­ sociate as being a 
“ wheeler dealer, entre­ preneur and promoter,” 

 gin’s Likud party in Is­ rael last Tuesday “ does not really matter.” 
In an interview published by the official 
Egyptian Middle East 
News Agency, Sadat said the United States “ has all the cards and the main influence over what will happen in Geneva.” The 
Arab leaders are pushing for an early resumption of the Geneva peace con­ ference on the Middle 
East. 

Basques kidnap industrialist 

MADRID, Spain - 
Disguised as ambulance drivers, Basque separa­ tists kidnaped an indus­ 

 trialist Friday as the gov­ ernment was reported moving to ease political tensions by considering clemency for political prisoners. 
Police said comman­ dos of ETA, an organiza­ tion whose initials stands for Basque Land and Li­ berty, kidnaped Javier 
Ibarra Berger, 64, from his palatial Bilbao home and escaped with a two- hour head start. 

Kidnapers free 
American man 

BOGOTA, Columbia - 
Gustav Curtis, an Amer­ ican businessman kid­ naped over six months ago by an unknown group, was freed Thurs­ day, Colombian police announced Friday. 
There was no information if a $15o,(HK) ransom demanded short­ ly after Curtis’ abduction last November had been paid. The American Em­ bassy had no comment on his release or any details on his age or home town. 

Japan-China peace opposed 

PEKING 
- 
China 
Friday accused a “ hand­ ful of reactionaries” in 
.Japan of opposing the 

 signing of a peace treaty between the two countries. 
The official New China 
News Agency said that the charge was made by 
Wang Yi-ping, vice- chairman of the 
Shanghai Municipal Re­ volutionary Committee, at a rally Thursday to welcome a delegation of the Japan-China Friend­ ship Association. 
The conclusion of a peace treaty between 
China and Japan is still held up over a Chinese proposal to include in it an 
“ anti-hegemony” clause covering the 
Asian-Pacific region. Ja ­ pan has so far rejected this clause which it deems anti-Soviet. 
Nuclear-laden truck crashes 

LONDON - A truck carrying a container w ith 
15 tons of radioactive nu­ clear material over­ turned early Friday out­ side Winchester, South­ ern England. 
The truck slammed in­ to three vehicles, slightly injuring five persons but causing no leak in the sealed container. 
It was on its way to 
Southampton, where the radioactive cargo was to be loaded aboard a freighter for the United 
States.

 lead to war in four or five years. 
The problem in 195o was similar, but it also was g reater. And the personalities were more 
\ olatiie. It was a struggle between a not-so-popular president and a general who was a superhero in a hero-worshipping time, 
Douglas A. Mac-Arthur. 
Political issue 
The Truman-MacArth- ur dispute played in the headlines for m onths, was a political issue, worried allies and en­ emies alike. It was truly a struggle between ti­ tans. 
The final act was a lengthy public statement by M ac-Arthur. which was diam etrically op­ 

 posed lo 
Truman's policy. 
** It was in open defiance of my orders as president and as co m ­ mander-in-chief.” 
T rum an wrote later. 
‘ This was a challenge to the authority of the pre­ sident under the Consti­ tu tion...by this act. 
Mac-Arthur left me no choice — I could no longer tolerate his in ­ subordination.” 
T rum an fired 
MacArthur and the gen­ e r a l’s return set off a wave of emotion and much oratory. MacArth­ ur got tiekertape parades in San Francisco and 
New York, then went before a joint session of 
Congress to say the words from an old West

Point hymn: ‘‘Old sol­ diers never die. they just fade away.” 
However, the parallel between 
Trum an- 
MacArthur and Carter- 
Singlaub occurred six months earlier. 
Chief in Korea 
MacArthur was com ­ m ander of the United 
Nations forces fighting the North Koren Com­ munist invasion of South 
Korea. In the same flam­ boyant way he had led 
American troops in the 
Pacific during World 
War II, MacArthur per­ sonally directed the am ­ phibious landing at In­ chon which led to con­ quest of most of North 
Korea. 
Truman, who had ap­ pointed M acA rthur to head the Korean effort, tried to get him back to 
Washington to talk over differences in policy. 
M acArthur, who had been out of the country for 14 years, refused. 

Dealing with a man wlK) had a powerful con­ stituency of his own, 
Trum an arran ged to meet M acA rthur half­ way, on Wake Island, 
Oct 15. 195o. 
At the Wake Island meeting. 
M acArthur 
‘ assured me that the victory was won in Ko­ rea,” Truman wrote in the memoirs. ‘‘He also informed me that the 
Chinese 
Com m unists would not attack.” 
A month later. Chinese 
Com m unists surged across the border. They forced the United Nations armies to retreat south of the 38th parallel and changed the course of the war. 
The split 

The problems between the two men escalated. 
MacArthur, with much public opinion on his side, advocated carrying the war into China. 
Truman saw that as the 

PRESIDENT TRUM AN pins m edal on Gen. MacArthur 

 sta rt of another world war. 
M acArthur favored bombing the Chinese 
Communists' sanctuaries in Manchuria, blockad­ ing the China coast and using the Chinese nation- alist forces of Gen. 
Chiang Kai-shek based on Formosa. 

‘I had never underes­ timated my difficulties with 
M ac-A rthur,” 
Truman later recalled, 
“ but after the Wake Is­ land meeting I had hoped that he would respect the authority of the P r e ­ sident...if there is one basic elem ent in our 
Constitution, it is civilian 

 control of the military.” 
At I a.m. April ll, 1951, 
Trum an called an ex­ traordinary news confer­ ence. R eporters were handed a series of p apers. The first was 
Truman’s announcement that MacArthur had been relieved 
‘‘with deep re g re t.”

Student seat on boards voted down 

EXPRESS CAPITOL BUREAU 
A l STIX — Two Bexar 
County state senators said Friday they don't think college students should have the right to sit on th<* governing hoard of their own col­ lege. 
That was also the feeling of other senators who voted down a bill providing for annual elections of students of faculty members to their college board. 
SB63o, toyed with by some senators as a means for students to overtake the school ad­ ministration. possibly died on tin* Senate floor after brief debate. 
The measure is spon­ sored by Sen. Kent Hance of Lubbock. It gained the support of mostly li­ beral senators. 
A IB-15 edge in favor of the bill was not enough to fake it out of tin* regular 
(irder of business for consideration. 
"Schools are for edu­ cation not for the stu­ dents to be running the show," said Sen. Frank 
Lombardino of San An­ tonio. 
Sen. John Traeger of 
Seguin agreed with Lom­ bardino. 
" I just feel like the administration should run the schools,” he said. 
“ I have two of my own in college and they could care less.” 
If the Hance bill were to pass it would permit student body and faculty elections for selection of two representatives to become non-voting members of their school 
‘■governing board. 
I 
Sen. Glenn Kothmann 
' of San Antonio voted for the measure. 

CREDIT RECORDS 
AUSTIN - By a slim margin of four votes, the 
Senate advanced a bill 
Friday that would allow the public to inspect in­ dividual records of cer­ tain finance companies. 
San Antonio state sen­ ators Glenn Kothmann and Frank Lombardino voted against the mea­ sure. Sen. John Traeger of Seguin was absent for the vote. 
SB887 by Sen. Bill Pot­ man of Ganado would give the public access to reports filed by licensed finance companies with the state consumer cred­ it commissioner. 
Potman, an outspoken opponent of loan shark legislation and excessi­ vely high interest rates for loan companies, ex­ plained the public cur­ rently is restricted from knowing the financial standing of finance com­ panies. 
“ About BO per cent of these finance companies are making huge profits and yet they continue to return to the legislature to ask for higher interest rates,” Potman said. 
Potman pointed out the legislature is asked to raise the rates while not extended the benefit of knowing the profits of finance companies. 
“ Who wants it?” said 
Lombardino when asked why he voted against the bill. “ It would .just be too expensive for the state to allow access to the re­ cords." 

BILLS PASS HOUSE 
AUSTIN — The House tentatively approved Fri­ day a handfull of bills sponsored by members of the Bexar County legis­ lative delegation. 
Five of the bills are sponsored by Sen. John 
Traeger of Seguin. They have already passed the

Food prices led to cost of living hike 

COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICED 
WASHINGTON 
- 
Higher food prices led to another big increase in the cost of living in April, the government reported 
Friday. 
But administration economists said they ex­ pected the food price surge to taper off in the second half of the year and the general rate of price increases to be more moderate. 
The .8 per cent rise in the Labor Department's consumer price index last month compared with gains of .6 per cent in March. I per cent in 
F ebruary and .8 per cent 

NATIONAL DIGEST 

 in January for what works out lo nearly a double digit rate since the year began. 
Inflation, according to another set of depart­ ment figures, has once again reduced workers’ purchasing power. Real spendable earnings, wages after the bite of inflation* fell by 
I per cent in April. In March, there was a drop of .3 per cent. In four of the last five months workers have lost ground. 
The figures mean that 

 inflation will remain for some months a major problem for the Carter administration. 
“ We’re worried tnat the inflationary surge might affect wage de­ mands, but there’s no sign of this happening yet,” said

 exports of color television sets to the United States in the first international pact negotiated by the 
( arter administration to help American industry face foreign competition. 
The agreement is not expected to increase prices of Japanese sets. which have flooded the 
U.S. market recently. 
The agreement reflects the course the adminis­ tration hopes to follow in limiting imports that may endanger U.S. in­ dustry by cutting into the 
U.S. market. 
Special trade ambas­ sador Robert Strauss said that if the adminis­ tration does not limit competing imports, 
“ then you’ll find a dra­ matic increase in a pro­ tectionist attitude across 
America.’’ 
The Carter adminis­ tration has shied from imposing higher tariffs or unilateral quotas on such imported goods as 
TV sets, shoes and textiles, despite requests from affected industries and labor unions. 
House sets energy goal 

WASHINGTON - The 
House expects to com­ plete action on President 
Carter’s energy propo­ sals by the end of July so that the Senate can follow through and the program can be enacted this year. 
House Majority Leader 
Jim Wright says. 
But the Texas Demo­ crat acknowledged at a news conference that re­ conciling the conflicting regional and other inter­ ests affected is the grea­ test challenge to Con­ gress. He said the voters may be ahead of Con­ gress in their willingness to accept tough measures such as the tax proposals, now the subject of House hearings. 
Senate passes strip mine bill 

WASHINGTON - The 
Senate voted to tighten an exemption of Appala­ chian strip miners from proposed federal con­ trols, but critics said a large share of eastern coal production would be left untouched by the tough set of national re­ clamation laws. 
The Senate also reject­ ed a House and adminis­ tration-backed ban on new strip mining of wes­ tern valley ranch and farmlands. 
The action would leave 
23 per cent of national coal production, rather than 33 per cent, unaf­ fected by federal con­ trols. 
Arson appeal is rejected 

BURGAW, N C. - Su­ perior 
Court judge 
George Fountain reject­ ed the Wilmington IO de­ fendants’ appeal for a new trial on Charges of arson and conspiracy stemming from racial violence in Wilmington, 
NX’., six years ago. 
Chief defense attorney 
James Ferguson charged in final arguments that the 1972 convictions of the nine black men and one white woman were obtained on the admitted perjured testimony of three witnesses and through so-called prose- cutional misconduct. 
The HI were accused of fire-bombing a white- owned grocery and firing on emergency officers. 

Judge stays

NEW YORK - U.S. 
Dist. Judge Milton Pol­ lack has stayed his order that lifted the local ban against Kennedy Airport landings by Concorde su­ personic transport jets. 
The temporary stay was granted until next 
Tuesday afternoon to give the Port Authority of 
New .York and New Jer­ sey time to seek a re­ medy in the U.S. Court of

Continued from Paso JA innocence. We believe justice will pre­ vail.” Smith said. 
It was revealed Friday that Paula 
Cantrell Derese, another party to the slaying and daughter of the dead cou­ ple. will be sentenced for first degree murder June 2o. 
Guilty 
She pleaded guilty .Jan. 24 and was a key witness in the McManus tria l which began two weeks ago. 
McManus and Mrs. Cantrell were charged with the slayings. The slay­ ings were committed so they could share in the estate* and insurance money of the parents. 
A third person, Vernon Olney, is charged with conspiracy to murder. 
His trial date has not been set. 
“ Easy money McManus.” is what the* prosecutor, L. II. “ Sin” Stewart, said while pointing his finger at 
McManus in the sentencing summa­ tion to the jury. 
"I feel Mr. Hinton and I did ever­ ything we could to get the death sen­ tence,” he told the jury. 
"How many acts of violence does it take to say a person is a dangerous person?” he pleaded. 
“ Professional killers don’t mutilate bodies as amateurs do,” he said. 
The Cantrells were beaten and strangled and their throats were cut. 
Mrs. Derese testified McManus told lier the job was done by himself and professional killers. 
Bloodthirsty 
“ It was bloodthirsty murder. Ile didn't need to slash their throats after strangling them to death,” Hinton said. 
Defense attorney Mark Vela argued the presentation of photos of the dead couple which the state asked the jury to look at again would only be emo­ tionalism. 
" I ll have his brains blown out at your kitchen table,” Mrs. St. (’lair quoted McManus as saying. The at­ tractive housewife was referring to her husband. Don St. Clair, the owner of two liquor stores. 
Mrs. St. C lair said she dated 
McManus while she was divorced from her husband. 

She said McManus’ threats began with a telephone call to her in January 
1976. 
She said when he called her 
McManus was very excited. He told her a professional k ille r had flown from Houston to Dallas to k ill her husband. 
Wealthy 
Mrs. St. (’lair said McManus knew sin* was wealthy and indicated he wanted her husband out of the way. 
She said she had inherited about $1 million from her late first husband. 
Two hours after McManus gave the warning, she said, a man called iden­ tifying himself as being from Dallas. 
She said the man told her if anything happened to McManus he would kill her whole family. 
Mrs. St. (’lair said she became ter­ rified and began carrying a pistol. 
She said a few weeks later McManus tried to extort $2oo a week from her for a period of 25 weeks, threatening to burn down one of her husband’s liquor stores if she refused. 
When Hit* St. Clairs reported these threats to the authorities, they were told there was insufficent evidence to file a charge. 
She said her final encounter with 
McManus was in February 1o7o when he came to her nearly completed new home. 
Locked doors 
She locked the doors, got her gun and telephoned her husband, she said. lh* told her to shoot McManus, she testified, but she just could not do it. 
She fled tin* premises by a back door. 
McManus phoned her the next day, sin* said, and told her he had no inten­ tions of harming her, that he only wanted to talk with her. 
St. Clair confirmed his wide’s testi­ mony. lh* said the day before she re­ ceived a phone call mentioning “ a hit man. a man who appeared to be 
McManus, with tape all over his face, approached him about a car he (St. 
Clair) had for sale. 
McManus told him to drive the car and that he, McManus, would be a passenger. 
At one point, McManus asked him to stop the car at a roadside park so lie could look into the trunk. 
LINDBERGH 

Continued from Page I V 

Lindbergh, was a center of attention at ceremonies throughout the day. She told a newsman it was only the second time in almost 4o years that she had taken part in a public function. The 
Lindberghs avoided publicity after the kidnaping of their son not long after the famous flig h t. She appeared relaxed and smiling Friday. 
At Kennedy Airport, Mrs. Lindbergh broke a bottle of champagne against the silvery side of a new Pan American 
747 .jumbo jet as she christened it the 
"Clipper Lindbergh.” 
“ I feel that the christening of a plane is an act of faith,” Mrs. Lindbergh said, ".just as my husband’s first flight to Paris was an act of faith.” 
From Kennedy, Mrs. Lindbergh went to Manhattan’s Hotel Biltmore for a luncheon w here she was present­ ed with an oil painting of Ireland’s 
Dingle Bay, where her husband made his landfall on his historic flight 
The painting was the work of John 
McCoy, a member of the ground crew on Lindbergh's takeoff and the man who turned the propeller to get his engine started. 
She was to attend a dinner Friday 

 ii jght at New York’s Waldorf-Astoria, to accept the Amelia Earhart medal, awarded by an international organiz- tion of women av iators. 
In remarks prepared for the dinner. 
Mrs. Lindberg, a wellknow author herself, quoted her husband as saying 
“ the goal of man is man himself.” 
“ I believe he meant the character of individual man.” she said, "his cour­ age, his integrity, his compassion for other men, his reverence for life of all kinds. 
“ The creations of man spring from the character of individual man. And man himself draws his character and strength from his roots in God’s earth.” 

Sen. Barry Gold water, R-Ariz., a general in the Air Force reserve, said in his prepared remarks that " if ever there was a time we needed Charles 
Augustus Lindbergh in our 2oo-year history as a Republic, I suggest the time is now.” 
Replicas of the Spirit of St. Louis were hung from billow ing make- believe clouds on the ceiling of the hotel ballroom. 
But it was a day less for form al speeches than for reminisences.

BANK INDICTMENTS 

I rn 
VERNON MCMANUS 
. . .d e a th sentence 
St. Clair said he refused, telling him it could be opened when he returned to the St. Clair Liquor store. 
Mrs. St. Clair had testified McManus told her he had a revolver and might have killed her husband at the road­ side park except that a police radar unit was there. 

36 loans is more than $1.9 million. 
Clark said the indictmente signal the end of the first phase of a state-federal effort aimed at South Texas banking irregularities. 
Leading the probe were Asst. U.S. 
Atty. W. Ray Jahn and Asst. Texas 
Atty. Gen. John Blanton. Blanton was appointed a special federal prosecutor to help present evidence to the federal grand jury. 
Investigation 
Clark said the investigation is con­ tinuing. The grand ju ry which re­ turned the indictm ents is not scheduled to meet in the immediate furture, he said, but the panel is sub­ ject to recall. 
He said the panel probably will be ready to return indictments against additional people within a few months. 
George refused to comment when he was released on bond. 
Surprise 

Farrow an attorney, told the Express he was completely surprised when an 
FBI agent arrested him Friday in 
Carrizo Springs. 
“ I don't know why I was thrown into this.” he said. “ I haven’t violated any confidences and I haven’t violated any laws.” lit* said he became a bank director in 
1954. 

He sold his 34 per cent interest iii 
Citizens State to a San Antonio group, which in turn sold the bank to Salinas. 
He was charged with one count of securing a $67,51)o loan from the bank which, he allegedly turned over to Sa­ linas. 
Charges 

Farrow said he considered filin g criminal charges in the case himself. 
He said he wrote Clark, offering to turn over inform ation Farrow thought would help investigators. 
He said he was subpoenaed and tes­ tified before the grand jury. 

Salinas is named in 42 of the 49 counts in the indictment. 
The misapplication counts allege a 

 bank officer loaned money to a person who then turned the money over to another defendant. 

Named as unindicted co-conspira­ tors in the case are Alex Short, a Sa­ linas associate;frmer officer of the 
.Juan Salinas, Enrique bank. 
Juan Salinas and Short were killed in a plane crash in Mexico last year. 
The indictment also alleges the con­ spiracy involved issuing certificates of deposit which had not been paid for or which had been paid for with checks drawn on foreign banks which had not been paid. 
The certificates of deposit would then be used to secure loans at other financial institutions, the indictment alleged. 

School told to hire black teachers 

MARLIN (AP) — The Department of 
Health Education and W elfare has asked the Marlin Independent School 
District to submit a faculty recruit­ ment program whereby half of its faculty would be black within the next three years. 
The letter, sent by Frederick T. 
C’ioffi in the Civil Rights Division, was the latest development in a battle over alleged desegregation practices in the district. 

The practices, first mentioned four years ago following an investigation by 
HEW’s Dallas office, included dese­ gregation in the student assignment programs and in the h irin g of teachers. A specific case referred to the demotion of a black school prin­ cipal. 
The letter received this week con­ tained no threat that Marlin’s federal funding would be cut off, and it referred only to the faculty situation.

Crash kills remainder of family 

AMARILLO (A P) — Tragedy struck a lexas family for the second time in three days Friday when a Dallas po­ liceman, his wife, daughter and father died in a plane crash. 
The bodies of Tony Wilkins. 28. his lather, JLT. Wilkins Jr.. 54. an inde­ pendent oil producer from Amarillo; his wife, Cynthia Lynn, about 24. and their 11-month-old child Erin were found in the plane wreckage. A search had started for the plane when it dis­ appeared from a radar screen. 
Patty Jean Wilkins, 52, the elder 
Wilkins’ wife, had died last Tuesday and was buried Wednesday in Amaril­ lo. The four surviving members of the immediate family were en route to 
Possum Kingdom resort near Mineral 
Wells Friday. 
The plane crashed in foggy weather after taking off from Amarillo Inter­ national airport at 9:35 a m. and it disappeared from the radar screen about three minutes later. 
The twin-engine 31o Cessna crashed in a wheat field 2V-2 miles southeast of the airport. Workers at the scene said the plane apparently was headed hack to the air terminal and was hanking when one wing hit the ground.

CHIE?, EXPRESS NEW S CAPITOl BUREAU 

AUSTIN — San Antomio’s schools and agencies escaped unharmed from last minute budget slashing which cleared the way Friday for agreement on a compromise stale spending hill for 1978-79. 
House and Senate negotiators ended a four-day deadlock late Friday by agreeing to cut $37 million from their version of the general appropriations hill. 
This left tin' compromise measure at 
$15.4 billion to he1 sent to the House and 
Senate for final approval. 

Late word Friday was that State 
Comptroller Bob Bullock's office had indicated as much as $15o million more may he available than originally esti­ mated for 1978-79. lf true, this coupled with Friday s committee cuts could leave enough on the table to narrowly finance such 
House-approved measures as public school finance, teacher pay raises and retirement benefit increases. 
The joint Houso-Senate* conference. 

Come join us in this great sporting event—our 

 com millet4 had been deadlocked since 
Tuesday after completing a siv-day, article-by-artide rewrite taken from separate House and Senate passed versions of the appropriations hill 
Senate conferees, apparently satis­ fied with the hill, wanted to let it stand 
House members, however, called for a two per cent, across the board cut off the top of all general revenue funds in the bill 
The two per cent cut could have provided $118 million more to help make up what had boon a predicted deficit of some $348 million. 

At a session Friday morning, the conferees instructed the Legislative 
Budget Board (LHB) staff to go hack over the hill and recommend areas where at least $1o1) million might he cut. 
The staff returned Friday afternoon with recommendations covering some 
$287 million. Out of this, tin* negotia­ tors opted to accept $37 million. 
The m ajor areas cut included 
• $18.1 million in purchased utility funds from tin* Departments of Mental 
Health-Mental Retardation, and Health 
Resources. 
• $3 m illion from tin* state textbook fund which had already been slashed once iii conference by $8 m illion. 
• 
$18 million from the general income'of the Univ ersity of Texas. This cut was made after UT officials re­ 

 ported higher than anticipated increases in tuition revenues, bond programs and sinking funds. 
San Antonio agencies survived the last minute cuts iii good shape'. Some experienced gains, with only San An­ tonio College lulling victim to any major losses 
The biggest beneficiary of increases voted by the conference* committee was the4 new)y-funded San Antonio State 
School for the Mentally Retarded due lo open iii March 1978 after a four-vear delay, 
SAU appropriations were cut nearly 
$1.5 million for the ne'vt two years in funding for vocational education and general state aid. 
The1 Stale' School got a boost of more than $4 million when negotiators agre'ed to expand the size and role of tile’ school above' House* reeommoneie'el levels. 
The University of Texas at San 
Antonio gamed half the amount re'* commended iii the Se'iiate budged hill when the conlerees voted $198,532 to pa.v for renovation of classrooms at the'

Pilot dies iii c h o p p e r erasli 

DALLAS (A P) — A helicopter used to feed traffic reports to a Dallas radio station crashed Friday, killing the pilot. 
It happened moments after a re­ porter had disembarked the craft be­ cause of high winds. 
Elliot Cohn, 3o, pilot for Helix Tran­ sport Inc., died in the crash. A spokesman for station EV IL said Cohn had let off reporter Suzy Humphreys and was fully airborne when the chop­ per sunk to the earth. 

Fund program 
Under the hill, the state would fund 
Hie program for $122,(MMI a year for the next two years. 
"This will make the Al* DU pilot pro­ ject eligible for nearly $2 million in federal funds," Vale said. 
The money would he used by the 
Welfare Department to reimburse col­ lege's arid vocational schools providing the training. 
The committee’s recommendation to fund the* program must still he* up­ turned in e*ilhe*r house version.

New council needs a gas fuss briefing 

City Council was one vote short of scuttling approval in principle of the pending settle­ ment of the contract dispute with Coastal States Gas Corp. this week. 
Fortunately, the m em bers voted to give themselves the op­ portunity to understand the settlement proposal and thereby take a responsible approach to the whole m atter. Mayor Pro­ tein Henry C isneros said the push for pulling the city out of the agreement was a result of a briefing last Tuesday by City 
Public Service Board Chairman 
Tom Berg. 

Cisneros said som e of the new council m em bers thought 
B erg’s attitude was arrogant and it provoked them to Thurs­ day’s rash action. 

The new council needs time to absorb the com prehensive nature of the proposal, to review the status of litigation and the prospects in court. They should have opportunity to ask ques­ tions about the proposal and ex­ plore any options they have. 
They need to know the details of the whole complex mess and how it may be resolved — and what issues lie outside the dis-* 

 pute. The price of gas, for ex­ ample, is beyond reach of the negotiators or the courts. 
The council’s freshman members are entitled to the kind of intensive information that the veterans have had over the past two years., A cram course is possible but the members need a session or two in which they can examine any question they have. 
There is an Aug. 31 deadline on the pending proposal but it could be changed if parties to the dispute want it. By Aug. 31 the Railroad Commission is li­ kely to be ready with its final order on rates. If the proposal seem s dead by Aug. 31, the city should move for trial, abandon­ ing the long-winded plea of pri­ vilege which is in recess, and press for change of venue so the litigation can wend its way through what is almost certain to be a decade in the courts. 
The council’s new members need to know' where they are going and how long it will take to get there, whichever course they take. In view of the effort led by Councilman Rudy Ortiz 
Thursday, the briefing — objec­ tive, open and full — ought to proceed soon. 

G eneral’s criticism of* policy focuses new* attention on Korea 

President Carter summarily ordered Maj. Gen. .John K. 
Singlaub home from his post of chief of staff, U. S. Forces in 
Korea. Singlaub had publicly criticized the President’s plan for withdrawal of Am erican troops from Korea. 
In San Antonio, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Bernard VV. Rogers said Singlaub was wrong in his assessment of the Korean situa­ tion and the presence of Ameri­ can troops there. 
Singlaub is wrong in publicly opposing policy, in any case, and he is likely to be relieved of his job there. Right or wrong, the presence of American troops in Korea 25 y ea rs after the fighting was terminated is an increasingly-difficult policy to support. Singlaub said a war would break out if U.S. forces were withdrawn. The inference is that Americans have adopted 

South Korea for perm anent safe-keeping. 

If South Korea, or Western 
Europe for that matter, cannot organize a credible defense in 25 years, it probably can’t organize one, at all. In which ca se, 
Americans should decide how the occupation should be sup­ plied and operated for the dura­ tion of whatever threat there may be. 

Gen. Rogers said the with­ drawal would be phased so that 
South Korean force could ab­ sorb the greater load of defense over a specific time schedule. 
Ile said he thinks the South 
Koreans are capable of defend­ ing their territory. 
Singlaub’s published views will help focus attention on the 
Korean burden Americans have carried for an expensively-long time. 
A bad bill squeaks past 

The House split to give a majority of one vote to the so­ called “ Roloff Bill” this week in the mistaken notion that church sponsorship of a child-care ser­ vice assures good management of it. 
■ 
Proper licensing and super­ vision by an accountable state agency are minimum standards for proper protection of children and the public interest. Church 

 sponsorship, with any sort of exemption from the necessity for licensing, is a twisted piece of logic subject to w hatever abuses a sponsor may stumble into. 

Fortunately, the bill appears to have little chance to pass the 
Senate. That’s a break for the public interest and for children subject to unlicensed care. 

All facts needed 

Sir: Referring to Mr. Ramon Gar­ cia's letter (May 13), perhaps he is right: Dr. Raul Gaona should have been tried for his “ crim es.” Then, the entire story would have been heard, and people would have learned that Dr. 
Gaona never signed a claim form containing false information. When a 
“ no contest” plea is entered — and this is what Dr. Gaona’s former attorney had advised him to do — there is no trial by jury. 
The facts of this case desperately need to be heard, before hundreds of 
“ victim s” (whom I choose to call 
“ patients” , and who are speaking out loudly in behalf of their doctor!) lose perhaps one of the few physicians in 
San Antonio willing to treat them. 
From personal experience, I can attest to the fact that Dr. Gaona has never refused to treat a patient at any hour of the night, even if that patient was a stranger to him. Further, he’s never asked whether that patient is able to pay for his services. 
A consulting firm ’s study of Dr. 
Gaona’s business office revealed thou­ sands of dollars that Dr. Gaona was entitled to bill but had not. Further, 
Dr. Gaona chose not to bill his patients for amounts not covered by Medi­ care/M edicaid. To me, this does not sound like the action of a person who is 
‘ unlawfully, knowingly, and wilfully” collecting money that is not his to collect — as the indictm ent against him stated. 
Anyone who has done the paperwork involved in Medicare/Medicaid claims can tell you that it’s a miracle that any of them get to the Feds correctly, because of the m orass of muddled government confusion which reigns! 
Sending Dr. Gaona to jail for five years for an unintentional overbilling of $225 
— when there was no intent to defraud anyone — does this sound like "equal justice?” I think not! 

(Mrs.) Elizabeth A. Skipper 
Military retirem ent program defended 

Sir: It is difficult to understand why the press repeatedly publicizes the opposition’s criticisms of the military retirement program, yet seems reluc­ tant to publish evidence of the basis for its computation, when com paring it with civil service retirement. 
I grew up in an era when patriotism was considered an essential attribute of every A m erican. My ancestors served honorably in both the Union and 
Confederate forces in the war between the states. P rio r to being com m is­ sioned in the A rm y I always held well-paid positions. 
Every retiree is entitled to what he legitimately earned during his active military service. Why should he be condemned if he dem onstrates special skills in fields of endeavor peculiar to government operations? Why should he be denied th e o p p o rtu n ity of participating in government activities where such experience can be profita­ bly utilized? Certainly it is wrong to deny the retiree the right to increase his income, especially when so many find current retirem ent income inade­ quate to maintain a decent standard of living.

Congress established active pay duty scales giving full consideration to the retire m en t rem uneration based on years of service, contrary to the m eth­ od employed in setting civil service retired pay, which involves retirement deductions. 
Also consider the vast disparity in the conditions of the two services. Civil service personnel work regular hours, usually have free weekends, have rea­ sonably unlimited tenure of office, and rarely experience disruption of their home life. 
The career military retiree placed his life on the line when he accepted service, was on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week, obligated himself to u n questioned obedience to the orders of constituted authority, and was frequently called upon to combat the nation’s enemies whether domestic or foreign. Their task was “ To do or die and not to question why” .

“Now?, I ask you — what’s wrong with the environment? 
Nothing — that’s what! Just look around!” 
Hands off Military retirees 

WASHINGTON - Politics is a callin'' in which a m ean spirit, a cheap shot, and a wide streak of hypocrisy can get you almost anything. 
All these elem ents are present in the current dem agogic uproar, sanc­ tim oniously jo in e d by P re sid en t 
Carter himself, directed against the million-odd Am ericans drawing m i­ litary retirement pay. 
“ I don’t think i f s right.” Carter said recently, “ to have someone go into the A rm y or Navy at age 21, serve 2o years, retire at age 41, and 
(hen get a full tim e job working with the federal government. 
“It is called doubledipping,” the 
President went on. “ I think it ought to be eliminated. 
Not alone 
Jimmy Carter is not alone in pick­ ing on military retirees. 
Defense S ecretary Harold Brown believes there are too many of them and they get too large a share of the defense budget. 
Sen. William P ro x m ire , D-Wis., who makes a good thing out of cheap shots al the m ilitary, regularly cas­ tigates retired officers for taking ci­ 

 vilian jobs in d e fe n se-re late d in ­ dustries. 
T a k in g an o p p o site ta ck , the powerful civil se rv ice unions and lobby, calling the* tune for the civil service committees of Congress, say m ilitary retirees ought to take pri­ vate jobs but stay away from the government. 
C ongressm en such as Rep. Los 
Aspin, D-Wis., another master of the low blow, keep complaining that mi­ litary people retire too early, but conveniently omit to explain that in most cases, retirement is not of the individual’s choosing because of acts of C ongress re q u irin g re tire m e n t after 2o, 26, 28 or 3o years service. 
Time 
The time when most military peo­ ple are forced by Congress to retire happens to be the m ost expensive time of most people’s lives — when they have children in college and other commitments at peak. 
Men in this situation cannot climb on the shelf and wait for old age. 
Sometimes Congress forgets why it retires military people early. 
One reason is not to provide a soft income for individuals but to m ain­ tain an up-or-out m e rit sy stem of 

Col. 
Robert D. 
Heini Jr. 

 prom otion in a highly dem anding profession, prom oting the able, re­ tiring the drones. 
Another reason is to avoid the kind of arm y we had in the 193o’s, with 
58-year-old captains and first s e r­ geants long on experience but short on wind. 
Fast 

That old-time Army had fought on­ ly one war in the previous 3o years. 
Our arm ed fo rces today, in the sam e time period, have fought three, with the riot surprising result that the retired lists — including a long roll of disabled retirees — are a lot longer th a n they w ere w hen P ro x m ire , 
Aspin, and Brown (not one of whom, incidentally, ever shouldered a rifle in combat) were kids. 
About 14o,ooo retired m ilitary peple work for the government. 

Less than 2oo of these ait* former generals or admiral. 
Only 23,ooo are even fo rm e r of­ ficers. 
The rest, about 8o per cent, are former enlisted men, whose military pension last y ear av e rag ed about 
$5,ooo a year. 
One in four re tire d se rv ic e m en works for the U.S. Postal Service, the low est-paid, most labor-intensive, unglam orous agency in the govern­ ment. 
Resentment 

No m atter where they find them ­ selves, the “ doubledippers” resent the term and bitterly resent the president’s having used it. 
They earned their retired pay and have the peculiar idea they are fairly entitled to the benefits they w ere promised when they donned the uni­ form. 
While in those jobs, they are as much entitled as civilian coworkers to what they get, as well as to further retirem ent benefits earned by further government service. 
No one has yet suggested that a military retiree employed in the pri­ vate sector should forfeit his pension 

 as a condition of employment. 
Yet that is what Congress already sets as a precondition iii the case of retired regular officers. 
Docked 

When they take a government job, they are docked 5o percent of all re­ tired pay in excess of $2,oo1) a year., 

With a w e a th e r eye to p olitics, 
Congress exempts retired reservists and all ex-enlisted men, w ho make up the largest part of the m ilitary re­ tired population, from the above pay cut. 

It is only the friendless regular of­ ficers who get their pensions short­ changed by the only people in the government who can vote themselves 
19 per cent raises in pay arid perq­ uisites, the triple-dippers of Capitol 
Hill. 

A r e g u la r o ffic er, it is w orth nothing, holds the only job under the federal government in which a man can be fired for conduct unbecom­ ing a gentleman. 
No similar sanction applies to Con­ gressmen. civil servants, defense se­ cretaries, or presidents. 

M otorist kills a good friend 

Sir: Cinnamon, the dog that lives next door to m e, was killed by a thoughtless motorist May 12. Cinna­ mon belonged to a nice family and this includes a young boy. 

Cinnamon was a brown nice size dog, no beauty, and his breed I suppose is called “ Multiple Lines,” and he had a big heart and an ever wagging tail. 

He really didn’t care if you voted for 
Carter or Ford, but he was a shrewd politician. He liked garbage men, the postman, grass cutters, meter readers, senior citizens taking their walks a r­ ound the neighborhood, children of all kinds. 
He came to many daytime socials, but liked his own home at night. 
He loved his folks so much and when they were gone for the day, he became lonely and visited neighbors as he liked people. 
He loved life, respected cats, toler­ ated other dogs. He didn’t believe in fighting. 
He loved to greet people as they cam e home from work. Somehow you becam e less w eary when you saw 
Cinnamon. Cinnamon loved “ free life” and this cost him his precious self. 
Mr. Motorist, you killed a friend to m any people. P ease watch for other 
“ Cinnamons” as our neighborhood will never be the same.

Second thoughts on Israel 

WASHINGTON - The reac­ tion to the Israeli election here has naturally been a little jumpy, but after the first official hiccup, the most thoughtful people have begun to take a more philosophic view. 
In the first place, officials here re­ cognize that Israel is just the first of the free nations to face an election this year — France, Japan, West Germany, italy, Canada, and several others will he rolling the democratic dice before long. 
So W ashington is try in g to r e ­ member that it is usually a mistake to confuse winning politicians with the nations they m erely represent for a little while. 
Everybody has been surprised and even startled here by the Israeli vote — 
How d are they elect an u n fam iliar peanut farm er like Menahem Begin! 
— But on second thought, Washington seems to have decided to shul up, and wait, and hope. 
No Comments 
The C arter adm inistration, which usually spouts off on almost everyth­ ing, seems to have understood that this is a tim e for a little judicious leav- ing-alone. 
Even the Congress has been co m ­ paratively quiet — only a crisis could stun them into such silence — and the friends of Israel on Capitol Hill have been m ore silent since the election than anybody else. 
Some officials in Washington think that the rejection of the Israel Labor party in favor of Menahem Begin and his Likud party and other m inority groups m ay be a good thing — may force Israel and its supporters in the 
United States and elsewhere to face up to the consequences of defying the 
Arab states, the United Nations, and even the United Stales, all of whom have been insisting that Israel abide by resolutions 242 and 338 of the U.N., and give up m ost of the territo rie s cap ­ tured from the Arab states in the 1967 war. 
The chances are that Peres, Rabin, 
Adon, and the other squabbling Labor leaders lost the election on personal and domestic issues — having lost the w isdom of that w onderful w om an, 
Golda Meir, before they fell apart — but now M enahem Begin conies to power with a record of rejecting the com prom ises Washington insists are necessary to negotiate peace in the 
Middle East. 
Interpretation 

One ut th e m ost k n o w led g a b le 
Americans in this whole controversy interprets the future in these terms: 
• “ My first reaction,” he said, “ was that this election created a real mess but after thinking about it, I’m more hopeful. The real scope for a decision by the Israelis is very limited. Maybe it is better if the hard things that have to be done by Israel are done by those who, like Menahem Begin, always op­ posed them .” 
• 
“ T h ere are only two practical possibilities, in my view,” he said, “ If 
Begin sticks to the uncom prom ising policies he has followed all Ins political life, then there is going to be a monu­ mental confrontation not only with the 
Arab states but with the United States, which he will lose, for P resid en t 
Carter, I think, has gone too far to back oil'. Or Begin will make a rational analysis of the situation once he has to take the responsibility of office, and will then negotiate a com prom ise peace. He really has no other choice.” 
• “ Meanwhile,” this observer con­ cluded, “ I think we in W ashington should sh u t up. W e're ta lk in g too m u ch , and too am b ig u o u sly , and telling everybody what they want lo hear. Now we have to wait and see w hat happens in Israel, and be ready to help, if we can, after they’ve consi­ dered what kind of policy the new go­ vernment is going to follow in the fu­ ture.” 
Practical problems 
There are, however, some practical problems in the relations between the 
United States and Israel as a result of this election. Ju s t before the vote, under intense pressure from pro-Is! raeli mem bers of Congress, the Carter ad m in istratio n reversed a previous decision and agreed to the production of some modern new military aircraft in Israel. 
Also, just before the election, Presi­ dent Carter, while supporting a “ ho­ m eland for the P a le s tin ia n s ,” pro ­ c laim ed a “ sp ecial r e la tio n s h ip ’’ between Washington and Jerusalem. 
But M enahem Begin opposes W a­ shington’s policy of giving up the Arab 
“ occupied territories” — he calls them 
“ liberated” territories — and claims 
Isra eli so v e re ig n ty over the land 
Carter is discussing as a possible “ ho­ meland for the Palestinians.” 
When President Carter met the Con­ gressional leaders at the White House ' after the Israeli election, according to our information, he urged everybody in attendance to be patient. 
U. S. - Israeli relations would sort themselves out in time, he insisted. It would be wrong to confuse politics and geography. Israel rem ained as she was: a d e m o c ra c y , with all its strengths and weaknesses, but still a vital interest of all the free nations, at the gateway of the continents. Maybe we should wait to see what the new 
Israeli government actually did 
Apparently Carter didn’t say there was a difference sometimes between what politicians said when they were out of office and how they acted after they got in, but some of the Congres­ sional leaders through he implied a difference — and he should know 

City rubs 
Fawn the wrong way 

Ministers sermonize against them. 
Ambitious law officers further their careers by waging 
“ clamp-down” campaigns against them. 
Massage parlor masseuses are apparently just flat on the wrong side of the tracks as far as the law and God are con­ cerned. lf they're not tainted women, they’re close. 
‘T m not a p ro stitu te,” says m a s­ seuse Fawn LaRoque. Firmly. 
E v ery th in g she says is firm . The 
23-year-old w o m an ’s shrew d brown eyes never flinch when she’s talking. 
Oh, they look down occasionally when she flicks ashes from the cig arette t h a t's alw ay s in h er fin g ers. But, flinching? No. 
She’s something like that big kid you w ere a fra id of when you w ere 
7-years-old. The big kid ran with the rougher crowd and you didn’t cross that kid. 
The woman pulls another cigarette from a pack near her phone beeper. 
W ell, does p ro s titu tio n go on in massage parlors? 
No knowledge 
“ Not that I know of. I ’m sure it’s going on in som e p la ce s,” says the woman, who brought two friends and her boss w ith her to the mid-morning interview in a local coffee shop. 
* “ We don’t know what goes on in the backrooms. We don’t go around peek­ ing in rooms.” 
Mrs. LaRoque wouldn’t have access to those rooms now anyway. Her m as­ seuse’s license expired last month be­ cause she didn’t comply with the city’s ordinance requiring all masseuses to take a course in physical therapy. 
The ordinance is cu rren tly being battled in court. And, in the meantime 
Mrs. LaRoque’s not sure when she can go back to work. “ It’s ridiculous,” she says.

The course was once offered at St.

M ost m a s s e u s e s h av e 8th or 9th g ra d e educations. T h e y ’re often d i­ vorced with children, explains Mrs. 
LaRoque. 
Likes her job 
“ If they could be a physical therapy m ajor, I’m sure they w ouldn’t be a m asseuse,” she states. 
What about you? Would you be a physeial therapist? 
"I like my job. I like my work . . . it isn’t just the money.”

NEW YORK TIMES ser v ic e 
WASHINGTON - Gerald R. Ford said Friday the televised interviews with Richard M. Nixon convinced him he had done the right thing in giving his predecessor a blanket pardon. 
While maintaining he did not share 
Nixon’s view that the President has inherent power to authorize illegal acts. Ford told reporters the legal and political controversy rekindled by the telecasts dem onstrated that he had been justified. 
Asked if recent Nixon statem ents had given him any second thoughts about the pardon, the former President replied: “ None whatsoever. The more I see of Nixon’s replies, the more I’m convinced that my reason for the par­ don has been validated.” 
Government problems 

Otherwise, Ford said, he would nave had to devote a quarter of his White 
House time “ listening to lawyers a r ­ gu in g about the tapes and so o n ,” rather than concentrating his efforts on pressing government problems like the economy. 
T alk in g with r e p o rte rs at a lu n ­ cheon, the former President observed that the legal problems of Watergate 
“ continue to divide the American peo­ ple" three years after the pardon and would have done so even more deeply if Nixon had remained .subject to pos­ sible crim inal prosecution. 
On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford as president gave Nixon an unconditional pardon for all Federal crim es that he “ com ­ mitted or may have com m itted” while in office, thus perm anently blocking any prosecution of his predecessor for any violations of law involved in the 
Watergate scandals. 
No comment 
As for reports that Nixon is eager to resum e a leadership position in the 
Republican P arty , Ford said: “ Mr. 
Nixon’s words speak for themselves, and I d o n ’t w ant to c o m m e n t any further on th e m .” 
In response to questions, bord went a long way toward resuming the poli­ tical offensive against the C arter ad ­ ministration that he had abandoned in a recent series of public appearances, 

 climaxed by a Republican fund-raising dinner here W ednesday night. V ar­ iously, he charged that: 
• 
The C arter economic p rogram , particularly on energy, has prompted a lack of confidence in the b u sin e ss community. 
• 
P re sid en t C arter has th u s far 
“ done a superb public relations job, and I hope when they get down to the nitty-gritty of substance that his lead­ ership will be just as com petent.” 
• 
A m ong the p ro b le m s that 
“ haven’t been tackled or solved” by the administration are strategic arm s lim itation, the Middle E ast, Cyprus and South Africa. 
• American troops in Korea, which 

Carter plans to withdraw over the next four or five y e a rs , a r e “ a good investment for maintenance of peace there." 
• 
"T here has been no significant moderation of inflation since this ad­ ministration took over.” 
• 
“ The odds are overw h elm in g ” that President Carter will not fulfill his pledge to balance the federal budget by 1981. 
• 
He was “ very very upset" about cuts in defense spending by the a d ­ ministration and Congress in the light of continued Soviet build-up. 
After the luncheon, Ford went to the 
White House for a private visit with the 
President.

D efective institutions called source o f problem s in Britain 

By PETER JAY 
SPECIAL TO EXPRESS-NEWS 
LONDON — We in Bri­ tain are a confused and unhappy people. 
So are those of our fel­ lows on the continent of 
W estern 
E u ro p e who have th e ir w its about them. 
So too are o u r m an y frie n d s in the U nited 
States who rightly see in the anguish of the United 
Kingdom the advanced stages of a disesase that has already taken hold throughout Western E ur­ ope and that is beginning to show its unmistakable sym ptom s in the United 
States. 
There may or may not be an y th in g we can do about the grounds for our u n h ap p in ess, w hich as things stand is thorough­ ly well founded. But th e re is no need to be confused. 
We a r e u n h ap p y b e ­ cause the foundations of our prosperity seem to be eroding faster and faster an d b e c a u s e we can n e ith e r find nor a g re e upon any sure rem edy for this decay. 
T h e s e a rc h for so ­ meone to blame adds to the confusion an d the bitterness. G overnm ent an d g o v ern e d b eco m e more and more alienated from one an o th er. The governors believe the governed to be irretriev­ ably greedy, feckless, idle and recalcitrant, 

I ntil recently, Peter Jay was economics editor o f 
The Times o f London. He has just been appointed 
Britain's ambassador to the 
United 
States by his father-in-law, Prime Minis­ ter James Callaghan (an appointment, incidental Iy, which may cost Callaghan his job). 

The following article is 

 excerpted from a lengthier one by Mr. Jay entitled 
"EnglanditisC which ap­ pears as part of *THE FU­

Industrialists complain that the capital m arkets and the b an k s do not support them because the financiers’ tim e horizons are too short and th eir understanding of indus­ try is negligible. 
Arid the investors ask how they can be expected to put up c a p ita l when the unions pre-empt all, or more than all. the po­ tential return on the now plant and equipment. 
Unedifying 
It is an u n e d ify in g sp e c ta c le and an u n p ro fita b le a r r a n g e ­ ment. Nor does it touch at any point on the true causes of the problem. 
These causes are little perceived; and the a n a ­ lysis of th e m can n o t com pete with the m ore readily intelligible, con- while the governed be-

, oieve the governors to be -crete anfl enjoyable sport stupid, corrupt, power- crazed and unrepresenta­ tive. 
Class vs. class 
Likew ise class is set against class, the middle classes denouncing the rapacity of the workers, while the workers rail at the p riv ile g e s an d the hypocrisy of the b etter off. 
In Britain, region is set a g a in st region, and s e ­ p a r a tis m g a in s ste a d y s u p p o rt in U ls te r, in 
Scotland, in Wales, and, by reaction, in England itself. 
The fissures spread out in all directions like an ice fall: disintegration in slow motion. 
Labor unions, business m a n a g e m e n t an d city financiers are locked in a triangle of m utual vitu­ peration and incompre­ hension. 
Union leaders point to the lack of investment in productive industry. 

 of exposing “ guilty m en” and baiting those w ho are in what is supposed to be 
“ power.” 
T h ere a re no g u ilty men, of course, but there are defective institutions. 
The political and econ­ omic organization of mo­ dern liberal democracies is dedicated, above all. to the satisfaction of indivi­ dual wants. 
How are we to establish what individuals w ant? 
By asking them. 
Howr are we to ensure that they get w hat they want, at least so far as possible? By letting them m ake the decisions, by letting them elect their governments and by let­ ting th e m sp e n d th e ir money in a free competi­ tive marketplace. 
Conflict 
This engagingly simple political philosophy has built into it the tension that lies at the root of our present troubles. 

For the m a rk e tp la c e for votes and the m a r ­ ketplace for goods oper­ ate according to vastly different and frequently incompatible criteria. 
When the dom ains of the economic and politi­ cal m arketplaces overlap 
— as they often do — they com e into s e rio u s c o n ­ flict. 
T h ese im p e rfe c tio n s have provided the politi­ cal pretext, though not the m ain motive, for in­ te rv e n tio n by g o v e r n ­ m ent in th e eco n o m ic domain. 
It is not necessary here to review the vast litera­ ture on the proper scope for the limits of such in­ tervention. Suffice it to say th e re is nothing in the operation of the poli­ tical m a rk e tp la c e th a t requires that those limits be observed. 
Indeed, the essence of dem ocratic politics is a gig an tic c ele b ratio n of the fact that you can get something for nothing, or at least that you — the individual voter — can get som ething for noth­ ing; for government, with its legalized pow ers of co ercio n , can a w a rd b en e fits h e re w hile it charges costs there. 
T h at in d e e d is the whole n a tu re of the r e ­ d is trib u tio n of w ealth and incom e, an alm o st u n iv e rs a lly a c c e p te d function of government. 
The point here is not to question the legitim acy of this aspect of the poli­ tical process, but to e m ­ phasize that it is a pro­ cess w ithout any se n si­ tive or automatic regula­ tor. 
In the very long run, it may be argued, societies will discover that it does not pay them to sacrifice too much of the incentive 

 functions of incom es to the cause of equality or 
“ fairness” ; but any such feedback is problem atic and highly uncertain. 
Relationship 
The conflict betw een the different logics of po­ litic a l and e c o n o m ic choice is m o st c le a rly manifest in the relation­ ship between unem ploy­ ment and inflation. 
The operation of free d e m o c ra c y a p p e a r s to force g o v ern m en ts into positions (th e c o m m it­ m e n t to full e m p lo y ­ ment) that prevent them from taking steps (fiscal and monetary restraint) that are necessary to a r ­ rest the m enace (acce- le ra tin g 'in fla tio n ) that th reaten s to u n d erm in e the co n d itio n ( s ta b le prosperity) on which po­ litica l s ta b ility and therefore liberal d em o ­ cracy depend. 
In other words, dem o­ cra cy has itself by the tail arid is eating itself up fast. 
United States 
If any nation is likely to escape the dilemma, it is th e U nited S ta te s , b e ­ c a u s e it c o m b in e s a comparatively mild form of the complaint with far and away th e to u g h e st political in stitu tio n s of any Western country. 
Inflation is more unpo­ pular in the United States than in almost any other in d u s tria l co u n try , e x ­ cept perhaps West G e r­ many. 
The A m eric an la b o r m arket is markedly less unionized; and there is a very large sector of gen­ u inely in d iv id u a l pay bargaining in the United 
States. 
This m eans that it is m o re likely th a t an 
A m eric an g o v e rn m e n t 

 can and will find political su p p o rt for a s tro n g stand ag ain st inflation, even at the price of se­ veral y e a rs of high un­ em ploym ent by postwar standards. 
At th e s a m e tim e, representatives may still be ele c ted ev e ry two years, p resid en ts every four and senators every six in accordance with an unchanged Constitution. 
Western Europe 
It is hard to be so san­ guine ab o u t 
W e stern 
Europe, where the econ­ omic weakness is greater and where political insti­ tutions have sh allo w er foundations. 
Countries like Britain, which do have a long tradition of political con­ tinuity, face the econo­ mic dilem m a in its most highly developed form. 
C o u n trie s like W est 
G e rm a n y , w hich face less acute econom ic d i­ lem m as, have the w ea­ kest political institutions and are therefore vulner­ able to even a m ild degree of econom ic a d ­ versity. 
Others, like Italy, have the worst of both worlds. 
In c o n s e q u e n c e , they have already slipped over the abyss and must soon be dashed on the waiting rocks of political anarchy and eco n o m ic d e p r iv a ­ tion. 
It can be objected that the e x p e rie n c e of the 
United States, West Ger­ many and other countries practicing ballot-box de­ m o c racy d is p ro v e s , rather than confirms, the thesis that the contradic­ tion between the im pera­ tives of the p o litica l marketplace and the im ­ p e ra tiv e s of eco n o m ic stability is c re a tin g an unstable and potentially d is a s tro u s r e lia n c e on accelerating inflation. 
T h ere is, of c o u rse , force in* th is point. It would be idle to deny that natio n al e x p e rie n c e s condition natio n al a t ti­ tudes differently and that these differences can af­ fect the speed with which objective contradictions in politic-econom ic sys­ te m s w ork th e m se lv e s out. 
This is indeed to con­ cede that preferences ex­ pressed through the bal­ lot box can. at least as a last resort, be brought to coincide with econom ic im p erativ e s before d is­ aster strikes 

Consistency m ust rest either on conceding that the United States is as doomed as the W estern 
E u ropean i nd u st r i a I i zed d e m o c ra c ie s , or by a l ­ lowing that the c o n tra ­ diction between political and econom ic i m p e r a ­ tives is not necessarily an absolute, but m erely an o b trusive and pow erful te n d en c y th a t p r e d i s ­ poses all toward acceler­ ating inflation and threa­ tens all but the most ro­ bust with collapse. 

T he la tte r c e r ta in ly b rin g s our th e s is into better line with the n a ­ tu r e of h is to ric a l te n ­ dencies (which a re s e l­ dom wholly m e ch an isti­ cally d e te rm in e d ) and probably fits the facts of 
A m erican and W estern 
E u ro p e a n e x p e rie n c e better. 

No m ention has been m a d e so fa r of th e 
“ socialist” alternative. 

WASHINGTON (AP) -— P re sid e n t 
Carter and former President Gerald It. 
Ford met in the* Oval Office Friday for a smiling discussion of general topics and said they are friends. 
After the meeting broke up, White 
House P re ss Secretary Jody Powell said it had been “ very friendly" and lasted an hour and five m inutes rather than the scheduled half hour. 
Powell said the two talked mostly about foreign policy, in c lu d in g the 
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and 
Vice P resident W alter F. M ondale’s current overseas mission. 
Cordial 

The session, noticeably m ore cordial than their first post-inaugural confer­ ence in March, opened with a long and relaxed exchange of ch it-c h a t w ith reporters let in to view the start of the reunion. 
“ Good afternoon, everybody,” Ford greeted the group. “ You all look the sam e.” 
“ He feels at home,” Carter said. 
“ We’re just good friends,” Ford said w ith a smile. 
C a rter ask ed about B e tty F o r d ’s health and was told she is doing fine. 
Then he thanked Ford for calling when 
Rosalynn Carter had recent surgery. 
Private talk 
After that the cameras and reporters were ushered out and the two men sat down for what the White House called an “ unstructured m eeting,” m eaning a general talk and no particular busi­ ness on the agenda. 
It was F o rd ’s second visit to W a­ shington s in c e he left office in 
J a n u a ry . D esp ite the frie n d ly e n ­ counter with C arter, it w as F o r d ’s most political outing in his new role as retired president. 

Ford met Thursday lyith Republican congressional leaders, party officials, and former Ford Cabinet m em bers. He capped it off by addressing a dinner which raised more than $1 million for 
GDP congressional cam paigns. 

Final two arrested in killing-theft 

INDIANAPOLIS 
( A P ) 
- 
T h e remaining two persons sought in con­ nection with the m urder and multi- million-dollar robbery of a reclusive widow were arrested Friday in Tem pe, 
Adz., authorities said. 
A spokesman for the Marion County 
Sheriff’s Department said Howard R. 
Willard, 38, and his ex-wife, Marjorie 
S. Pollitt, 48, both of Mooresville, Ind., were apprehended by FI agents. 
Charges 

Both were wanted on first-d e g ree m urder charges in the death of M ar­ jorie Jackson, 66, who was found shot to death in her fire-charred home May 
7. Police found m ore than $5 million in cash hidden in g a rb a g e c a n s, tool­ boxes, drawers and a vacuum cleaner bag and believed up to $6 million m ore might have been taken. 
About $1.6 m illion w as reco v ered after three other persons were arrested in the case. One has been charged with first-degree m urder, arson and b u rg ­ lary, one with theft and one with pos­ session of stolen p ro p erty .

Ll. (ion. Jay T. Rob­ bins, one of tho United 
States top aor jai aces, t an truly credit his heart for fin d in g him a sweetheart who later be­ came his bride. 
Of course, that’s the way it works in most romances. 
But in the general’!* case, a heart check-up put him in contact with a lovely 
A rm y nurse named Ina Louise Priest. 
In 1942, General Rob­ bins, who now lives in 
San Antonio, was flying 
P-38 fighter aircraft in the Southwest P a c ific when a pesky heart-tim­ ing problem flared up. 
Nearest m achine 
The nearest e le ctro ­ cardiogram machine was at the Arm y hospital in 
M elbourne, A u stra lia , and that’s where he met the future Mrs. Robbins, who was head nurse on one of the h o sp ita l’s wards. 
“ I could have come on home because of my heart,” General Robbins said, “ but I felt physi­ cally capable.” 
He went on lo score 22 aerial victories over en­ emy fighters, the fourth highest number of enemy planes downed in the Pa­ cific during World War 
II. 
Tw ice, on separate missions, the general de-

 st roved four enemy fighters. For those per­ formances, he was twice awarded the 
D is tin ­ guished Service Cross, the nation’s second high­ est honor. 
F ly in g with the 8oth 
Fighter Squadron, Gen­ eral Robbins knocked down 13 fighters in air combat during his first three m ajor contacts with the enemy. 

He became com ­ m ander of the famed 
•‘Headhunters” 
.Squad­ ron in January 1944, and under his leadership, numerous pilots attained ace status — shot down five or more enemy air­ craft. 
The 
“ Headhunt­ ers” was the first outfit to reach 2oo victories. 
His most memorable mission occurred on Oct. 
24, 1943. 
Twelve P-38s were fly­ ing escort for bombers attacking Rabaul when 5o 

Japanese fig h ters ap­ peared. The ensuing bat­ tle raged from 25 to 
25,ooo feet, with General 
Robbins destroying four enem y w arplanes and badly damaging another. 

Low on fuel, with his plane shot up and one engine out, he s till es­ corted the bombers out of the target area but was then forced to land at a small, remote Australian airstrip Off the northeast coast of New Guinea. 
Pursued 
“ Several 
Zeros 
(Japanese fig h te r planes) pursued me, so I headed for a 
Navy cruiser I saw in the dis­ tance.” the general said. 
“ The cru ise r started shooting at me, but then they saw the distinctive tw in -ta il of my P-38. thank goodness, as I flew close to the ship, shot down a Zero that was right on my tail. When I

 finally landed. I counted 
181) bullet holes in my plane.” 
General Robbins cre ­ dits his success in aerial com bat to excep tio na l eyesight and n atu ral shooting skill, which he developed w h ile bird hunting as a boy near his hometown of Coolidge, 
Tex. 
After earning a diplo­ ma and a commission at 
Texas A&M U niversity, he entered active duty at 
Randolph Field and un­ derwent flight training there and at Corsicana and Victoria. 
First assignm ent 
One of his first assign­ ments follow ing W orld 
War II was at 12th A ir 
Force Headquarters at 
Brooks AFE. Following a num ber of operational assignments, he became 
D ire cto r of Aerospace 
Safety in 1963, then chief of staff of the Pacific A ir 
Forces in 1967, co m ­ mander of the 12th A ir 
Force headquartered at 
Bergstrom A F B near 
Austin in 1968 and vice commander of the Tacti­ cal A ir Command in 197o. 
He retired Sept. I, 1974, as vice commander of the 
M ilita ry A ir lif t Com ­ mand. 
G eneral 
Robbins leaned toward Austin as a retirement home, but decided to move to San 
Antonio instead so he could be close to his brother who lives here. 
“ I had never re a lly looked at San Antonio,” he said, “ but the more I did, the better I liked it.” 
View ing the m ilita ry today, he expresses con­ cern that the U.S. m ili­ tary ca p a b ility is g ra ­ dually going downhill. 
“ We lost a lot in Viet­ nam in terms of material resources,” he said. “ We used to be able to make up with in genuity and m otivation what we lacked in m a te ria l re ­ sources. But I ’d say we’re wobbly in both ar­ eas. 
Yet the Situation isn’t totally gloomy. 
Dedication 
“ There was an uns­ w erving ded ication to country when 
I was growing up,” he added. 
“ I see this same thing in some of the young kids growing up these days. 
Vietnam had an unfor­ tunate impact on younger people. Bul when I come in contact with some of the kids in my neighbor­ hood, even very young kids who are polite and courteous, who say 'yes, s ir’ and 'no, sir,’ I get the feeling that things are really looking up.” 
W recker crewman robbed 

A w recker crew m an was robbed at gunpoint 
Friday after being d is­ patched to pick up an automobile for alleged failure by its owner to keep up payments. 

A suspect was apprehended by officers following the 7 a.m. inci­ dent. 

Charged with ag g ra­ vated robbery w ith a deadly weapon was Eddie 
Fuentes, 37. of 8o7 Men- chaca St. He was jailed in lieu of a $25,ooo bond set by acting Night M agis­ trate Michael O’Quinn. 

The crewman, Oscar 
Hernandez, 19. told of­ ficers he and Fernando 
Gonzales, IS, were sent by their w recker com ­ pany to pick up a 197o autom obile in the 8oo block of Menchaca St. 

S h o u tin g 

They had succeeded in hooking chains to the car when a man rushed out shouting som ething about getting a gun, re­ ports said 

The crewmen left, only to return to retrieve the chains. This tim e, the man waved a gun at the two and the pair left, re­ ports said. 

They drove to a nearby fillin g station. W hile 
Gonzales telephoned the owner of the w recker company, the man drove ti|) arid forced Hernandez at gunpoint to the floor­ board. officers said. 

A fter taking H ernan­ dez’s wallet containing 
$125. the man left. The man was arrested at his home shortly afterwards, police said.

Galveston trip just has to be double-header 

Son Antonio EXPRESS NEW S— Saturday Moy 21 1977 
H 
Page 
I B 

This story is the second game of a double-header. 
Recently Bonnie and I did a story on Galveston. 
It was a “ city” story. 
We told of Galveston’s restoration of 
The Strand — in the center of its his* torte downtown. We told of new res­ taurants and unusual shops on The 
Strand and of marvelous 1oo-year-old buildings turned into downtown apart­ ments. 
We told of the Bishop's Palace — of a movie on the 1ooo storm — and even of the state's oldest oleander, now in a tiny grass plot in front of a downtown business building. 
We stayed at a motel and ate at res­ taurants. 
Now for the second gam e of that double-header. 
Beach trip 
For this gam e we traveled the 3o m iles of Galveston Island's seawall and sandy beach from the ferry that crosses to Bolivar Peninsula west to where San Luis Pass meets the Gulf. 
The city restaurants at which we ate were good ones. Galveston has long been known for its food — seafood. 
Italian and sometimes a touch of Cajun 
French. 
But before taking off for our camp­ site down the island, Bonnie stopped at one of those wonderful fish markets on the Galveston wharf and bought IO big" shrimp. 
If you are a reader of these pieces, you know our weakness for this — 
At tw ilight, we got out our little charcoal grill and put it in the sand at a spot w here we could see the breakers come rolling in. Pushed by the tide and a strong wind, they were unusually high — and marvelous in their rough­ ness. 
Then we grilled those big shrimp — flavored with Bonnie’s spicy marinade 
— and given that special taste that can only come from a charcoal fire in the salty air of the Texas Gulf. 
No award-winning restaurant could match those shrimp. 
In time we were in our camper and

■ ■ ll 
Si 

For this gam e we traveled the 3o miles o f Galveston 
Island's seawall and sandy beach from the ferry that crosses to Bolivar Peninsula west to where San Luis Pass meets the Gulf 

 in our sleeping bags. The night was dark — heavy clouds blacked out the moon and the stars. 
We could not see it but we knew the sea was just over there. The last thing we beard before we went to sleep were those rollers coming in — and their bass-note lullaby put us back to sleep every time we stirred. 
Ferry ride 
We were camped in the front row of the campground of Galveston Island 
State Park facing the Gulf. It is a relatively new state park and we had never visited it — though we spent many wonderful days on the lonely, beaches of the lower end of Galveston 
Island before there was either a park or the San Luis Pass bridge. 
Before telling of the state park, let us 

 tell some of tile tilings about a drive down the island. 
Passengers on the ferry at the east end of the island get a glimpse of one of 
Galveston’s landm arks — or, more accurately, “ seamarks. 
Across that beautiful stretch of open water — not far from where once stood the historic Quarantine Station — there is the hulk of a sunken ship. It is sitting on the bottom of the bay but much is above water. It was sunk there 55 years ago. 
It is a ship made of concrete! 
For many years, the “ hermit” who lived on it was a favorite story about 
Galveston. 
Charles K. “ Chuck” Lawrence of tile 
Galveston Chamber of Commerce gave 
Bonnie and me the story of the ship — the Selma. 
In World War I there w^as a desper­ ate need of ships to supply the war in 
Europe. Someone sold the U.S. Ship­ ping Board on the idea of m ass pro­ ducing ships made of concrete. 
Big flop 
The Selma was built at a cost of $2 million. 
It later sold for $1oo. 
In 192o, the Selma — one of 12 con­ crete ships that were built— broke down in Tam pico. It was towed to 
Galveston. But it could not be repaired and nobody would buy it. 
In desperation it was decided to sink it in the bay at a spot where it would not interfere with shipping. Four tugs carried it to its watery grave on March 
9, 1922. 
Over the years, people had ideas about using it for recreation, such as for a fishing pier. But no idea worked out. 
“ Finally the hull was purchased for 
$1oo,” the chamber report says, “ by 
Clesnay N. ‘Frenehy’ LeBlanc, one of the old salts on the waterfront. 
“ Frenehy eked out an existence on the ship for several years until tem ­ porary blindness sent him to the ho­ spital and he had to give up his ‘castle in the sea.' ” 
From the east end, we crossed the island to the seawall and then headed down the Gulf. 

The wonders the tide brings to the beaches are many — particularly if you are a little girl first caught up with the winders of life. Here April Williams — she’s 6 — points out the wonders of a jellyfish to sister Kimberly, who is 5. The Williams sisters are from Pasadena. 

Soon in front of us was a pier. On it a long, low building reached out over the water. Once this was the most talked about pier in Texas. 
This was the famed Balinese Room, 
Its heyday was the heyday of wild­ catter Houston oilmen who were as willing to risk their dollars on a roll of the dice across the green felt of a Ba­ linese table as they were to risk them sinking a hole where they alone thought there might be oil. 
Plenty of other high-rollers shared their philosophy. 
Band leader Phil Harris — with his beautiful wife, Alice Faye, sometimes 

 at ringside — was favorite entertainer and favorite son. 
And the Balinese theme song was 
Phil's stirring version of “ That’s What. 
I Like about the South.” 
But, in time, Galveston changed its ways and its image. 
The Balinese Room now is the Ba­ linese Dinner Theater. 
Fishing piers 

Next comes a big, relatively new, hotel built out over the water. And on down the seawall is another Galveston tradem ark — a series of long, high fishing piers. 

How many thousands have fished from those piers over the years! 
Jutting out into the water from the root of the seawall are long, low red granite groins. 
The groins have caused underwater san d b ars to build up — and these sandbars mean bigger waves. Those waves make the Galveston seawall a favorite with su rfe rs — and with watchers atop the wall. 
The waler was cold and the day gray when we were there. The surfers were w earing their w et-suits and they

Continued from Pa g e IR looked like big. black bugs as they 
'vent in and out of the waves. Between every pair of groins there were a dozen or more surfers. 
Back of the seawall is another Gal­ veston reminder of other days — the days when countries defended their coasts with great fortresses looking out to sea. 
Fort Crockett 

This one is Fort Crockett — soon to be IOO years old. It was started in 1S79. 
Once the big guns of three of these forts guarded the entrance to Galves­ ton Bay and the city’s waterfront. 
But early in World W ar II, dive bombers made seaside fortresses and 
Coast Artillery obsolete. So today Fort 
Crockett’s great gun emplacement with its massive concrete walls and roof are empty. 
Someone once came up with an idea of putting one of those roadside type zoos there. But it failed and all that is left is a faded sign on the concrete wall with “ rattlesnake” about all that can be read. 
Now for a little about Galveston Is­ land State Park. The park is 12 miles 

 down the island from Galveston. 
It is a wonderful place to camp. And if it is filled, there are still the miles of wonderful beach all the way down to 
San Luis Pass. 
That night and after breakfast the next morning, Bonnie and I walked up and down the beach. The park allows no vehicles on the 1.6-mile section of beach in front of the park. 
As always, one of the joys of these walks on the beach is seeing what the sea has brought it. There were odd pieces of wood and rope from ships and some fine old logs back at the edge of the low dunes. 
But the chief surprise was a big, round, barnacle-encrusted float — 6 feet long and more than 2 feet in dia­ meter with a rope attached to one end. 
We have no idea what its use was. 
Four high school students — a boy and his sister and two of their friends were having a wonderful time running single file up the beach. 
Then, of all things, two eirls came along carrying skateboards. 
There was an explanation. One of tho.se charity walkathons was going up the island road and headed for the

Clean air standards resisted 

SPtCIAl TO THI EXPRESS-NEWS 
WASHINGTON - A fight to ease stringent clean air standards which could cripple in­ dustrial growth in Texas w ill be taken to the House floor by U.S. Rep. Bob 
Krueger. 
Krueger joined U.S. 
Rep. Bob Gammage of 
Houston in issuing a press release protesting a move by the Texas Air 
Control Board to invoke stringent air pollution standards. 
The two congressmen charge the policy could halt millions of dollars in building investment in the Houston area alone. 

An amendment to the 
Clean Air Act proposed by the two Texans was rejected in April by the 
House Interstate and 
Foreign 
Commerce 
Committee. 
The joint press release issued 
Friday by 
Krueger and Gammage charged “ irresponsible attitudes” prevented its acceptance. 

The two congressmen said their am endm ent would have exem pted 
Texas from the most stringent pollutant re ­ quirem ents as long as planned projects met al­ ternative standards.

 are 236 birds on the list. 
A park release says that 95 per cent of the knowTT'species of migra­ tory shorebirds in Amer­ ica spend some time on the island each year. 
From Peltier’s office, 
Bonnie and I went to the hay side of the park. We this area was the most 

 magnificent part of the thought this area was the mast magnificent part of .the park. We do not know a park in 
Texas that duplicates it. 
From a little rise, we looked out across the wide m arshes, the hay inlets and the island out in the water. 

The nature trails are here and boardw alks cross long stretches of the m arsh. There are low, little enclosures — blinds for looking at the birds close at band. 
But the most m arve­ lous part of the day .was still before us. 
Leaving the park we 

 drove a short distance on the road leading down the island. The tiny blooms of the blackberry, tall thistles and the m atchless orange and black of the firewheel bordered the road. 
Then we cut left to the beach and headed down it. Because of the day 

 there were few campers and fishermen. 
Best part 
We drove mile after mile in wonderful loneli­ ness. 
The sky ranged from gray to darker clouds. 
Much of the time there was a drizzle and two or 

 three times there was a sudden shower. 
And always on our left was the sea. 

At times we could not resist stopping, getting out of the cam per and just standing to watch the waves come rolling in. 

In time we were at the most wonderful place of all — the little spit of sand where San Luis 
Pass broadens into the storm y w aters of the gulf. It is the end of a wonderful island. 

Then we crossed the graceful high bridge to 

 the just-as-beautiful far shore. 
A drenching rain had driven some fishermen to the shelter of their cars 
But not two men — brothers with the dedica­ tion of true fishermen. 
They walked up under the bridge and continued to cast.

BALTIM ORE - Seattle 
Slew will race on medica­ tion for the first time when he runs iii the Preakness at 
Pimlico Saturday. 

"Yes. we put him en tlit* Blite list,” trainer Billy Turner said 
Friday. ” 1 knew the track is go­ ing til be as hard as a rock. It always is dim ii here. A very last track stings a horse.” 
Turner's decision to use Buta- zolidin, which is sort of an aspirin for horses, means that under Maryland racing regula­ tions Seattle Slew must run ,on the medication in the 13-16 mile 
Preakness. 
Although Buta/olidin also is legal for racing in Kentucky, 
Turner said Seattle Slew did not have it when it won the Derby. 

“ First of all, we had so much rain down there I didn't think the track would be hard.” Turner 

 said. “ I didn't think it would even be fast.

I'm really not in favor of racing on it.” 

Bulazolidin is not legal in Now 
York, where unbeaten Seattle 
Slew has scored four of his six wins. Turner declined to use it for the colt's two races in Flori­ da. 
Of his decision to use Blite Sa­ turday, Turner said: “ We didn t come here to play games. This is the Preakness. There s no sense in leaving any stone unturned.” 
Declarations to use Bulazoli­ din also were made by the trainers of Cormorant, Sir Sir,

AUSTIN — Baylor put its best arm forward Friday night in the 
Southwest Conference baseball tournament. 

Sammy Bickham, a freshman left­ hander who “ pitched like a senior” , handcuffed powerful Texas A&M on seven hits as the Bears beat the 
Aggies, 2-1. at Disch- 
Falk Field. 
The victory puts the surprising Bears i i i the tournament finals against either A&M or 
Texas Sunday at 7:311 p.m. A&M and 'Texas play an elim ination game Sunday at 3 p.m. 
Should Baylor lose its Sunday game, the final game w ill be played Monday at 7:3o p.m. 
No games are scheduled Saturday due to commencement at the Univer­ sity of Texas. 
Texas advanced to the semifinal round by eliminating Arkansas, 8-1, 
Friday afternoon. 

In that game, which was halted twice* by rain, a freshman also played a key role. 
Andre Robertson, a some-time starter for the Longhorns, drove i i i three runs with a homer and a triple. 
Designated hitter Rusty Getter scored twice and sparked two scoring rallies with a pair of doubles as Texas won its 
52nd game of the season. 
“ Bickham was great,” Mickey Sul­ livan, the Baylor coach said. “ He pitc hed like a senior tonight 
“ His breaking stuff, especially bis slow curve, was working perfectly. 
A&M is an aggressive team. They go up to the* plate swinging. .So Sammy’s the best pitc her to throw against them.” 

A&M Poac h Tom Chandler agreed. 
“ We couldn't do much with Bick- harn’s curve. We real Iv have to hand it to him. Ile kept us off stride and we were over-anxious at the plate* We we're* struggling all night with the bat” 
Indeed the* Aggies wc*n*. Except bli­ the second inning, . when they loath'd the bases with one out but failed lei score and in the sixth when they did score, the* Aggies were under Bick* ham’s power. 
Neither team elal much through the first five innings as Bickham (1o-2) and A&M left-hander Mark Thurmond were locked i i i a superb pitching duel* 
Lead 

But i i i the sixth, the Aggies, who have a .3o3 team batting average, took the* leael when Reibert Beamer doubled, went to third eof a sacrifice bunt by 
Buddy (irobe and scored on a sacrifice fly by Mike Hurdle. 
The Bears, who have* now won IO of their last ll games, came right back i i i thi'ir half elf the* sixth to tie the game. 
Fritz Connally Ice! off with a double and came home on a sharp single* to right by Ken Kolhorst. 
Baylor scored the* winning run i i i Hie* seventh whe'ii leonard Woods, the* No. 
7 bitter in the lineup, tripled off the left-center field wall. 
That play sent Thurmond (IO I) to the* showers and David Pieczynski came* on in relief. 

The* first batler Pieczynski faced was 
Burl ( eike*r. wliei had helped pitch the* 
Bears tee a 3-2 victory over Texas 
Thursday night Coker worked Un* count tee 3-2, them lashed a single Ie* center to drive in Woods. 

“ It was fun to beat Texas A&M ,” 
Bickham said. “ The team played we*ll and rose to the* occasion. We got our run whe'ii we* needed it aud played tough. We are si iii reac hing our peak

Bouts eyed in Alaska 
NEW 'tuKK — A West Coast promoter who proposes to link 
5oo theaters and auditoriums into a national closed-circuit television network is attempting to outbid the commercial networks for professional football rights by offering the 
National Football League $4oo million for five-year rights to the Super Bowl and champion­ ship playoff games. 
The N FL commissioner's office has confirmed the offer, and said the pro­ posal was one of several that would be considered next month, when negotia­ tions begin for new contracts. 
The bid from the promoter. Bill 
Sargent, is substantially higher than the networks art* likely to offer for those events. Under their present con­ tracts. ABU. CBS and NBG among them pay approximately $57 million a season for rights embracing tilt* entire sc hedule of games. 
“ This is a business matter and one we will have to look at carefully,” said 
Robert Cochran, director of broadcasts for the NFL. 
“ But money isn t everything. There are other considerations." 
Whether it is ac cepted by the* N FL or not, the $4611 million proposal is ex­ erted to spark congressional concern, because it prose lits the possibility that only two million people, paying $166 for their seats, would have access to games that are normally watched on commercial television by as many as 
82 million people. 
Several Representatives, including 
Lionel Van Deerlin. D.-Calif., and chairman of the 
House 
Communications subcommittee, have recently said that they would take le­ gislative action if sports events were drawn off the networks by pay-tele- vision promoters. 
If his proposal should be accepted by! the football league, Sargent, an inde­ pendent producer of motion pictures, plans to present the championship games on large screens, with stereo­ phonic sound. Tickets would be sold only on a package basis for all nine games. 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska - In­ vestigators looking into charges of phony fights and fixed rank­ ings in connection with the re­ cently canceled U.S. Boxing 
Championships are checking in­ to two fights listed as having been fought here in 1973 and 
1974. 

The network called off the tourna­ ment in the wake of charges that one fighter had been required to pay a kickback to enter and reports that the records of some of the contestants were inaccurate. 
Bill Schwartz, working for a law firm hired by ABC Sports, said Friday he is investigating the circumstances surrounding two fights which the 1977 
Ring Record Books says were held here. 
Records 
The first fight involved lightweights 
Ray Lampkin and Nick Alfaro and state records show that it did take place on Oct. 18, 1973. However, 
Lampkin had been scheduled to fight 
Jessie Lopez. 
Promoter Phil Hauser said at the time of the fight he assumed Alfaro was Lopez. “ He (Alfaro) didn't hardly speak any English at all and I didn’t talk to him very much. When some­ body says they are sending you a par­ ticular fighter — especially in a case like that where he (Lopez) was relati­ vely unknown and there weren’t any publicity shots — you just have to as­ sume that you're getting what you’re supposed to be getting.” 
Name 
The Anchorage Times reported that the switch would never have been made public if Alfaro had not been so pleased with his performance. He lost hut went the distance against the 
Lampkin, then the world s top-ranked lightweight challenger. 
In a post-fight interview with a 
Times sports writer. Alfaro revealed his identity. “ I want this on my record under my real name," bt* said. Alfaro said a matchmaker had ordered him to keep his identity secret.

Tom Nissalke may be the NBA’s Coach of the Year, but he was never offered the

That is w hat Put Williams, general manager of the 76ers, told the Express-Nevvs exclusively 
Friday. 
Nissalke, named Coach of the Year Thursday, said he was “ very close” to be­ coming the coach of the Sixers three years ago. 
“ Tom was interviewed in the spring of 1972 after Jack Ram­ say resigned,” said Williams.

“ I was very close to getting the job three years ago,” claimed Nissalke, former coach of the

“ They (76ers) asked me if I d like to coach all the superstars they were going after and I said 
‘No! ” ’ 
“ Lither Tom’s been misquoted or it’s an inac­ curate statement,” said Williams. “ Tom’s a good friend of mine, a very good friend. But we never talked to him about the job in the three years I ’ve been here. 
“ And I ’ve never talked to him about coaching any kind of players.”

 as a team.” 
The Bears are now 37-12. 
Texas, meanwhile, snapped out of its hitting slump, pounding two Arkansas pitchers for 12 hits. Six of the Longh­ orns’ hits went for extra bases. 
Besides 
Robertson and 
Getter. 
Bobby Kearney. Mickey Reichenbach and Jerry Jones had two hits each. 
Kearney, from San Antonio, also drove in a pair of runs. 
“ I was pleased with our hitting.” said (Jiff Gustafson, the Texas coach. 
"It was a better display than last night 
(Thursday when the Longhorns lost to 
Baylor, 3-2, and had only seven sin­ gles). 
"Still. I’m skeptical, we’ve been in a team slump for the last 2o-23 games. 
But we’ve had some games like this, hitting-wise, scattered in there. We hit well in the first game against Baylor 
(during the regular season) and against A&M. But we have a tendency to lapse back into our feudal-type hit­ ting. 
"You can say pitching has someth­ ing to do with it, hut this was the same guy (Arkansas starter Mark McLain) who allowed us one run in ll innings in 
Arkansas. 
The Longhorns jumped on McLain in the first inning when, with one out,' 
Getter and Rocky Thompson hit consecutive doubles to make it 1-o. 
Texas loaded the bases but McClain,, worked out of the jam by getting 
Charlie Proske to hit into a double play. 
"When someone cracks the ball like 
Getter and Thompson did in the first inning, ifs contagious. I think we caught some momentum,” Gustafson said. 
Robertson’s home run, which traveled 34o feet down the left field line, made it 2-o in the fourth. 
Then in the fifth the Longhorns turned the game into a rout, scoring five times. 
Jones started the rally w ith a single and Getter followed with his second double. Reichenbach aingled to score 
Getter, went to second when Proske was hit by a pitch and scored when 
Kearney lined a single to left. 
Robertson then followed with his triple, which went to the 375-foot mark in left-center field to score Proske and 
Kearney. 
Getter, a transfer from Temple JC, was a surprise starter. The junior from 
Dallas played in only 16 games during the season and been at hat only 24 times. 
"He started out as one of our regular hitters during the pre-season,” Gus­ tafson said. "Then he lost his stroke. 
During our scrimmages he didn’t hit. 
Then Scott Soden (who was later side­ lined for the season with an injury) got hot and forced himself into the lineup. 
So there was no place for Getter. 
"B u t a couple of weeks ago, he started cracking the ball again. He said he was seeing the hall better.” 
For Texas, it couldn’t have come at a better time. 

Car paym ent lost on horse fcinch’ 

In at least one way horses are a lot like humans. Some mornings when they wake up they just don’t feel like running. This might be one of those days for Seattle Slew. 
Sure, the dark brown colt looks like a lead pipe cinch to capture the second leg of the Triple Crown today. Besides, a few weeks ago in Louisville Slew’s jockey, Jean Cruget, looked me right in the eyeballs and gave his personal guarantee that he would “ easily win the Preakness.” 
Yet, my thoughts keep racing back to 1948, back to the month of 
July when I was $2o short of making a car payment.

Lam upset 

AUSTIN (A P) — Johnny "Lam ” 
Jones of Texas sped to a 1o.8 second time in the IOO meter dash but was upset by former TCC sprinter Bill 
Collins Friday night in the Longhorn 
Invitational track meet. 

Collins, who runs for the Hurricane 
Track Club of Houston, nipped Jones in the furlong in 2o.3. Jones, who also anchored the UT sprint relay to a 4o.29 time, was clocked in 2o.4. Collins is a former SWC sprint champion. 

Mark Collins of Baylor qualified for the NCAA meet in the 88o by winning in the 8oo meters in 1:48.9 and Shilton 
Baker of Texas A&M was the only double winner, taking both hurdle events. 

Teams from ll schools entered the meet which was a warmup for next weekend’s USTAFF championships in 
Wichita. Kau. 

The monthly payments on that sleek, 
1947 Nash Ambassador were $62. They would have only been $59.5o but I in­ sisted on some extra chrome and a gas cap that popped open when I punched a button beneath the steering wheel. 

They just don’t make cars like that anymore. Lordy but that was fun, tooling into a gas station and ordering five gallons worth of regular. I ’d let the attendant jack around with the cap for a few moments and then I ’d pre­ tend to notice his frustration. “ Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot.” Then I'd punch that tricky button and the gas cap would fly open. In 1948 that was stronger than a duck-tailed haircut. 

At any rate, after IO days of hard pumping I was still $2o on the shorts of that $62 monthly stroke and the bank had already sent its “ second notice.” 
Second notices aren’t nearly as polite as first notices when they give you benefit of all doubts and open with, “ it has probably slipped your mind but you are now three days overdue with..” 

The surest and most immediate so­ lution seemed to be the nose of a magnificent horse named Citation, the 
Seattle Slew of that day. But Citation had already captured the Triple Crown and, at that time, was 19 for 19 as a three-year-old. Imagine, a colt going to the post 19 times and winning all 19. 
Why, Whirlaway only won 13 of 2o during his three-year-old campaign in 
‘41 and the great War Admiral was only tested eight times in ‘37, the year he took the Triple Crown. 

It seemed unfair to that poor book­ maker in Houston for me to plop $52 down on Citation’s nose. But then, there was that poor banker who was waiting for my car note. Or my ear. 
There was just no way that I was going to surrender that luxury liner with the plop-top gas cap for the want of a twenty dollar bill. 
Second biggest surprise of that day was registered by the Houston book­ maker, Mr. Warner, when I placed my 
$52 on his counter in the basement of the old Ambassador Hotel, Mr. Warner had never before known me to wager more than $2 unless it was IO minutes past post-time and his watch was slow. 
You would have thought that Willie 
Sutton was trying to return a wallet. 

Of course, the biggest surprise of that day was when Citation finished second. When the great horse went wide in the stretch and finished half a length late I could just see some junior vice-president at the bank trying to get gasoline into my car. Durned if I was going to tell ‘em about that secret button. 

Historians still use Citation as a yardstick for all great colts. They look with awe at that fantastic record of 19 victories in 2o starts in 1948. For some reason, I ’m not nearly as awed as most folks. 

The hat dream 

But enough of this serious stuff. Did you hear about the horseplayer who dreamed of nothing but hats one night? 

Hats of every description kept roiling through his dream and, often, they would float around the forms of fast horses. Sometimes his dream showed a jockey wearing a derby in­ stead of a cap and then a jockey wear- 

AUL OF THIS OM 
CITATIOM, KID ? 

 ing an oversized golf cap. Those jocks were always on the lead horses in the guy’s dream. 

When he awoke he called his semi- friendly bookmaker and asked for a rundown on the horses going at Santa 
Anita that day. ‘‘Anything in the first race named after a hat?” he inquired. 
The bookie thumbed through the 
Racing Form chart and replied, 
‘‘yeah, Straw Lid is going in the first race.” Then, "how about the second race?” Again a pause and, “ yeah, we’ve got Derby Dream in the se­ cond.” Sure enough, in the third a horse named Cap’s Delight was going but when they came to the fourth race the bookmaker balked. "Only thing I can see even close to a hat in the fourth is a nag called Checkroom,” the bookie said. 

“ Okay, gimme a $1o four-horse par­ lay on those four horses you named,” the dreamer ordered. Done. Then came the waiting period. After a few hours the player called the bookmaker again and he was told that Straw Lid won and paid $47 for a two dollar tick­ et. Big upset. 

Thirty minutes later the player called again and learned that Derby 
Dream had galloped home first and paid a ton. Another big upset. That meant that for a $1o investment the dreamer had $5,o1o riding on the third race. 
You guessed it, Cap’s Delight came bounding home a w inner in the third so the bettor had $17,5oo going on Check­ room in the fourth. He was also going bananas at home, pondering the plea­ sures of his new- wealth. 

After a reasonable wait he called the bookmaker one more time. “ Tell me, how did Checkroom do in the fourth?” 
The bookmaker sounded relieved as he said, "Sorry, but he ran out. You lost 
$1o.” The player sobbed softly and like all losers who want to see the next card that they didn’t take, inquired, ‘‘what was the name of the winning horse?” 
The bookmaker answered, “ aw, it was won by some Mexican horse named 
Sombrero.” 

The point of all this is, Seattle Slew should win by two lengths or more to­ day. He should, but I can give you about 35 reasons why he might not.

Ceruleans to duel 
Gottfried 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

ROME — Vitas Gerulaitis of the United States beat top-seed­ ed defending champion Adriano 
Panatta of Italy 1-6, 7-6, 6-3 
Friday and entered the semifin­ als of the $185,ooo Italian Open tennis tournament. 

Gerulaitis’ semifinal opponent will be Brian Gottfried, who defeated 
Australia’s Kim Warwick 7-5, fi-2 to insure the United States of its first finalist in the tournament since I96o. 
Phil Dent of Australia beat third- seeded Hie Nastase of Romania, a two-time winner here, 6-3. 6-2 in an­ other major upset of the day which turned the tournament wide open. 
Gerulaitis, of Howard Beach, N Y., fell behind 4-o in the first set and and won 6-1 in just 2o minutes—never missing a shot. 
Gerulaitis stood watching from the base line most of the time. 
Nervous 
“ We were too nervous to play well, but I felt the pressure very much in tin1 first set because I could not get my first service shot in,” the American said. 
In the second set. Gerulaitis went to tilt* net more often and began putting some pressure* on Panatta, who was clearly annoyed by the crowd that of­ ten shouted when the players were in action or about to serve. 
“ The crowd really bothered me. It took quite an effort to keep from ar­ guing with the fans,” said Panatta. 
The Italian dropped his service in the very first game of the second set with a double fault in the last point. 
Gerulaitis broke again in the fifth game and took a 4-1 lead. Panatta, however, rallied for service breaks in the sixth and Kith games and tied the score 5-5. 
In the tiebreaker, the Italian was trailing 1-6 but he again rallied and moved to a 6-6 tie. Gerulaitis, however, remained cool and calm and took the next two points to w in the tiebreak 8-6. 
Tie 
In tilt* third set. the Am erican jumped to a 3-o lead but Panatta fought desperately to a 3-3 tie with a break in the fifth game. The Italian, however, appeared tense and tired. Gerulaitis kept control of the net and scored an­ other break in the eighth game and went on to win the set 6-3. 
"It was a tough match,” Gerulaitis said. “ There were also a few people making noise in the crowd, forcing us to stop in between services and that rattled our nerves.

Cougars silent in car probe 

ASSOCIATED PRESS' 

HOUSTON - University of 
Houston Athletic Director Harry 
Fouke said Friday the school’s investigation into the financing of football recruit Darrell She­ pard’s new car is almost com­ pleted but Fouke declined to divulge any results. 

“ W e’ll turn over the information from all sources to the Southwest (’(in­ ference and I ’ll have nothing to say publicly about it.” Fouke said. 
Shepard, the 1976 (’lass 4A all-state quarterback from Odessa High School, received a new sports car shortly alter signing a foootball scholarship with the 
Cougars in February. 
Mrs. Rose Shepard, the athlete’s mother, said she purchased the car for 

 her son and got it financed by a Bra­ zoria bank 3oo miles across the state because she could not get financing in 
Odessa. 
SWC Commissioner Cliff Speegle has said the SWC is conducting its own investigation into the case. SWC Pre­ sident Kenneth Herrick however has refused to say if the SWC has formed a committee to investigate the case. 
“ I don't anticipate anything very drawn out,” Fouke said. “ Ifs pretty clean cut what the situation is and it ought to be resolved before too long a time — at whatever level.” 
Houston Coach B ill Yeoman has labeled the whole case “ a collection of innuendoes." 
National Collegiate Athletic Associa­ tion rules prohibit a college or its representatives from helping a pro­ spect with any kind of financing. 
A high school athlete is considered a prospect until he enrolls in college.

INDIANAPOLIS — Tom Bigelow wouldn’t mind some rain before he tries to qualify for the Hist Indianapolis 5oo mile auto race on Saturday. 

“ I never thought I ’d come to 
Indianapolis and hope for rain.” Bige­ low said Friday after completing his final warmups for Saturday’s t hi rd qualifying session for the May 29 race. 
“ But, the track needs rain badly to get rid of the rubber and grease it’s picked up. 
“ I think I ve got a good chance to qualify, hut I think you’ll find all the drivers smiling if it rained before the final two days of qualifications." 
Bigelow’s pit crew timed him at i87l2 miles per hour Friday, which was one of the fastest performances of the day. 
“ The day before, the crew clocked me at 188, so I think my chances of making the race once again are pretty good," Bigelow said. “ I just hope there aren't a hunch of sandbaggers a r­ ound.” 
Bigelow is trying to qualify for the race for the fourth consecutive year and continue what has been his best 
Near on the U.S. Auto ( lull s cham­ pionship circuit since he joined ii iii 
1968, 
More hot weather was forecast for the weekend. Heat and humidity have kept speeds down all week. Tin* mid-afternoon temperature Friday was 9(1 degrees and the temperature oil the asphalt track was 136 degrees. 
“ Our cars just can’t perform at their capabilities with these* weather condi­ tions,” the 37year-old Bigelow said. 
“ I’d say we’re losing about three miles an hour because of the heat. 

Veteran A. J, Foyt, trying to become* the* first driver to win at Indianapolis four times, was one of the* few quali­ fiers on the* track. He was the* only driver to top 19(1 with a 196.396 in.p.Ii. practice* lap.

PHILADELPHIA - The Philadelphia 
7Hers have been in a pressure conker ever since Julius Erving joined the club back in 
October, bringing with him talk of a cham­ pionship and an instant “superteam.” 

But the Portland Trail Blazers plan to apply a different kind of pressure when the National Bas­ ketball Association’s besl-of-seven cham pionship series begins Sunday. 
•‘We have to attack quickly and p ersistently,” says-Portland Coach .lack Ramsay. “ We can't let them run and we can't let them set up their one- on-one offense." 
This means more of the pressure defensive tac­ tics. particularly by the backcourtmen. which were so successful in the four-game semifinal sweep of 
Los Angeles, when the Blazers’ guards harassed the

 we can pressure them without hurting ourselves.” 
Portland has four gu ard s who can run all day—Lionel Hollins. Johnny Davis. Dave Twardzik and Herm Gilliam. 
Philadelphia, on the other hand, is hurting in the backcourt because No.! reserve Lloyd Free is side­ lined by a painful rib and chest injury. That leaves only little-used rookie Mike Dunleavy behind the starters, Doug Collins and Henry Bibby. 
Philadelphia Coach Gene Shue respects Portland's pressure game. “ They have great quickness,” he said. “That's what we have to contend with. They win their gam es on defense. They’re very aggres­ sive. They win their gam es by pressing. 

“There just isn’t any team in the league like this team. They gear their offense to their defense. They play fast-break basketball. This has given us a problem over the year, that style." 

It gave the Sixers quite a problem back on Nov. 2, when the Blazers embarrassed Philadelphia 148-1114, the Sixers’ most lopsided loss of the season. The clubs went on to split their four regular-season meetings. 

Both clubs held workouts at the Spectrum Friday. 
Philadelphia, having won one more gam e than 
Portland in the regular season , w ill have the home-court advantage should the series go a full seven games. 

“After what we’ve been through, I honestly don't know how to read it,” Ramsay said of the home- court edge. “We beat both Denver and Los Angeles on their courts and m ade it stick. But against 
Chicago, we had the advantage-—and needed it.” 

The home-court advantage was a big one in the regular season, when Portland was 35-6 at home and 
Philadelphia was 32-9 and neither could play .5o(1 hall on the road. In the playoff semifinals, however, both clubs were able to win twice on the road.

McGee, 
Player tie 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DUBLIN, Ohio — Jerry McGee and Gary 
Player matched four-under-par 68s Friday and moved into a tie for the lead in the second round of the $225,ooo Memorial Golf 
Tournament. 

Host Jack Nieklaus, the sponsor, course designer and builder and guiding force behind this event, also shot a HH and moved within two strokes of the lead halfw ay through the tournam ent that aim s for eventual major-championship status. 
"For the last 365 days I’ve been waiting to get back to this tournam ent,” said McGee, an Ohio native. "I know my wife will be glad when this week is over, because all she’s been hearing is Memorial, 
Memorial. 
“ I want to win this tournament more than any other in the world, including the four majors. And if this doesn’t become a major, then you can scratch the others,” said McGee. 
“The man, the course, the state. Those are the reasons I want to win it. The man (Nieklaus) is the greatest player ever to put two hands on a club. The course is the greatest in the world. Incredible. And 
Ohio, well, I’m a Buckeye all the way. Ohio has everything in the world” — he paused briefly and flashed a m ischievious grin — "except a passing quarterback." 
Player was prompted by the muggy heat to aban­ don his usual all-black clothing in favor of an all- white ensemble. He didn’t make a bogey and missed only one green in matching McGee’s 136 total for two trips over the Muirfield Village Golf Club course that has been hailed by the select international field here as one of the world’s finest. 
"Actually, I’ve played very well all year," said 
Player, a South African who hasn’t taken a title in this country since 1974.

A drawing card for tourist $$s 

A little water — in the form of a lake — does wonders to the economy of an area, and the economic value rises as the size of the lake increases. 

Lake Guerrero, a reservoir approxi­ mately 17o miles south of Matamoras in the Mexican state of Tam aulipas, covers almost 1oo,ooo surface acres, and it has become a focal point for the distribution of tourist dollars, prim ar­ ily from the pockets of U.S. hunters and fishermen. 
The lake provides good freshwater fishing. Below the dam is the Soto La 
Marina River, which some 5o airline miles away meets the Gulf of Mexico at 
La Pesca, a fishing village that now can be reached by paved highway. 
Things were different a few- years ago. Depending on the weather, a fisherman bent on trying for snook, reds, tarpon and trout at La Pesca spent several hours or several days negotiating the ruts between the Ma- tam o ro s-V ictoria highw ay and the coast. 

Tamaulipas is a state for sportsmen. 
It drops southw ard from the Rio 
Grande to Tampico and encompasses many m iles of isolated beaches, la­ goons and barrier islands sliced by natural passes. 

 inland will be found possibly the g re a te st co n cen tratio n s of w h ite­ w inged doves in the w orld, plus su b stan tial populations of wild pi­ geons, parrots, chachalaca and quail. 
Thousands of acres of grain crops — m ilo, corn, sunflow ers — hold the doves and provide food for them . 
Nearby, dense stands of brush provide nesting sites, and if there is any real danger to this magnificent game bird in Tamaulipas, it is the clearing of the the brush to m ake room for m ore

Cooperation of government 

Last w eekend five o th er outdoor w riters and I fished Guerrero (a report on the fishing will appear on the Sun­ day Express-News outdoor page) and had the p leasu re of m eetin g one morning with the governor of Tamau- lipas, Enrique Cardenas Gonzales. 
The governor, accompanied by Eu­ genio H ernandez of the M inistry of 
Tourism , chief of the state police 
Mario Flores and several other state officials and businessmen, met with us at La Retama cam p on the shores of the lake. 
Other writers present included Stan 
Slaton of the Houston Post, Roy Swann of the Corpus C hristi C aller-Tim es, 
Jesse Miller of the Brazosport Facts, 
Ray Sasser of the Port A rthur News and John Gill of the San Angelo Stan- dard-Times. 

The governor em phasized the fact that the administration of President 
Jose Lopez Portillo and the state go­ vernm ent of Tam aulipas are vitally interested in promoting tourism and then opened the meeting to discussion of everything from problem s Am eri­ cans might have crossing the border to obtaining such things as hunting li­ censes and gun permits. 

The governor said La Pesca, now that a paved road reaches the village and electricity is on the way, will be developed into a resort area complete with hotels and m arinas. 
Eugenio Hernandez is a good man for the hunter or fisherm en heading for Tamaulipas to know. Eugenio is a hunter and fisherman and can provide 

EUGENIO HERNANDEZ 
. . . director of tourism 

 valuable assistance to sportsmen and regular tourists. Rene Del Alto and his wife, Rosario, work with Eugenio out of the Ministry of Tourism office in 
Victoria. All three speak English.

Jonas to replace 
Steinke as coach respond 

Tennis backers 

KINGSVILLE — Fred Jonas has become the fifth head football coach in the 52-year history of Texas A&I University. 

Jonas, who has been an assistant on the Javelina staff for the last IO years, was nam ed the new head man Friday morning by Dr. Gerald B. Robins, president at Texas A&l. 
He replaces Gil Steinke, who resigned last week after 22 years in the position and will remain athletic director at the institution. 
“ Fred is a highly motivated, enthusiastic and hard-working individual and I know he'll make an outstanding coach,” Steinke said. “ He has been a key member of our staff for the last IO years and his record during that time speaks for itself.” 
Jonas has been defensive coordinator for the A&I squad for the last decade and during this time the Javelina defense has developed a reputation as one of the best college division units in the nation. 
The team has won the Lone Star Conference total defense, passing defense, rushing defense and scoring defense titles on numerous occasions and swept each of these categories last fall. 
The Javelinas have been the LSC total defense leader in each of the last three seasons. 
Jonas has coached several players who have gone into the professional ranks. 
Defensive back Jam es Hill, defensive back Eldridge Small and defensive lineman Ernest Price were first round draft choices; defensive backs Alvin 
Matthews and Dwight Harrison were second round picks, and safety Levi 
Johnson was a third round choice. 
Fullback Don Hardeman, a first round choice iii 1975, played linebacker his first two seasons with the Javelinas.

Donald, 
Hallherg in finals 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PINEHURST, N.C. - Gary 
Hallberg overcame the putting heroics of Mike Holland to win a 
23-hole North and South Ama­ teur Golf Tournament Friday and join Mike Donald in the finals. 

Donald, 21-year-old former national junior college cham pion from Hol­ lywood Fla., trimmed Ken Krieger, of 
A urora, Colo., 4 and 3 w ith two- under-par golf in the other semifinal. 
Hallherg, who will be 19 May 31, is from B arrington, IIL, and has just completed his freshman year at Wake 
Forest. 
Before gaining a place in Saturday’s 
36-hole finals by winning the five-hole sudden-death m arathon, one of the longest in recent tournament history, 
H allberg saw Holland knock in six putts of 12 to 15 feet. 
Putts 
Holland, a University of South Caro­ lina sen io r from B ishopville, S.C., canned four long pu tts through IO holes, winning two and twice saving halves. 
Twice in extra holes, he knocked home do-or-die 15-footers—for a par on the 2oth hole and a birdie on the 22nd. 
But in the final analysis, it was his putter that did him in. He three-putted the 23rd green, his third such lapse, to help Hallberg win. The teenager sank his five-footer after Holland was seven feet short from 4o feet and missed. 
H allberg, who did not three-putt, didn’t let Holland’s exhibition rattle him. He explained, “ I just kept telling myself I needed to sink my putt to tie a hole. I expected him to make his. Oth­ erwise, it would have gotten to m e.” 
Hallberg was one over par, the first time in six matches he hasn’t shot at least par over the 7,o51-yard No. 2 course at the Pinehurst Country Club. 
He won the first hole, but lost two of the next three and had lo par the diffi­ cult fifth hole to get even. 
Lead 
Holland jumped into a two-up lead with a birdie on number eight and a p ar on n u m b er nine, but H allberg again drew even, winning the lith and 
13th with pars. Holland regained the lead with a birdie four on the 16th, but he missed the green at 18, and Hall- berg’s par four squared the m atch, bringing on one hour of overtime play. 
Donald, who plans to enter Georgia 
Southern University in the fall after dropping out of school for a year, said, 
“ I didn’t hit the ball as well as earlier in the week, but my chipping and put­ ting was real good. I got it up and down several tim es.” 
Krieger, a Georgia Southern senior, started quickly. He won two holes with birdies from 3o and 15 feet and earned a half w ith a 22-foot birdie to stay even with Donald through seven holes, but then lost his touch. 
Donald won eight and nine with pars to go two up and added the 12th when 
K rieger three-putted, m issing from two feet. The winning par three on 15 wrapped it up for Donald. 

Karl has surgery 

Spur guard George Karl was in good condition following surgery on his left knee for removal of calcium deposits, a Methodist Hospital spokesman said 
Friday evening. It was the sam e knee that was operated on last November.

NFL to bypass probe 

PITTSBURGH (AP) - The National 
Football League says it will not be­ come involved in an investigation of allegations linking three Pittsburgh 
Steelers to a jobs program scandal. 
“ It’s not a football-related matter. 
We’re aware of it, but we’re not acti­ vely involved. It’s not like it involves gam bling or anything,” said NFL executive director Jim Kensil. 
Meanwhile, Allegheny County Hist. 
Atty. Robert Colville said if the inves­ tigation clears Franco Harris, Ernie 
Holmes and L.C. Greenwood, he will say so publicly. 
He said the Steelers were only minor figures in the Manpower probe and 
I [ayes stumps in Dallas 

DALLAS (AP) — Ohio State football 
Coach Woody Hayes, often crusty and at tim es belligerent with the news media, has shown he can turn on the charm when he puts his mind to it. 
The Buckeye coach displayed a pleasant demeanor and a ready smile during a Dallas visit Thursday to promote Ohio State’s Oct. I football gam e in D allas ag ain st Southern 
Methodist. It will be the Buckeyes’ first football trip to Texas. 
He admitted his tantrum s have so­ metimes caused em barrassm ent for himself, but he added, “ Sure I’ve been embarrassed. Haven’t you? But Teddy 
Roosevelt said if he could be right 51 per cent of time, he would keep trying. 
Actually, the things I’m more ashamed of are the things I didn’t do.” 
BUT HE SAID HE PAYS NO AT­ 
TENTION TO THE Ohio State student newspaper and alumni who condemn his on-field conduct. “ There are al­ ways people like that,” he said. "Your pressure comes from your players. I like to think I always have a good relationship with them .” 
The Buckeye coach did bristle at a suggestion he might be nearing re­ tirement. “ I’ve always said I would coach until i found something else I like better.” 
Hayes said he regards himself as “ a pretty good couch. Roekne and Lom­ bardi and those guys were super. 
Anybody who com pares him self to those guys is a m egalom aniac.” 
And he said he is disturbed by big money contracts in pro sports these days. “ I suspect I could have made ten times more than I have. I made up my mind a long tim e ago that money wasn’t going to be my major concern. I am biased, very biased about these large contracts. Money never brings happiness.” 

 they have drawn unusual attention because they are professional athletes. 
Holmes and Green have been men­ tioned as possible recipients of some of the m isspent funds in the federal 
Manpower program . H arris was in­ vestigated for his alleged role in get­ ting people who did not work on the 
Manpower payroll. 
“ If I had any part in a $2 million fraud, I wouldn’t be here. I d be abroad someplace sticking my heels up in the air and relaxing,” Holmes told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He called the charges laughable.

Mexico to get paintings 

J 

NEW YORK (A P) - 
Sotheby Parke Bernet, the art auctioneers, agreed Friday to with­ draw three disputed paintings from a scheduled auction and send them hack to Mex­ ico, where the govern­ ment considers them 
“ national treasures.” 
But Mary-Anne Mar- 

A M exican go v e rn m e n t decree in 195*) lim ited the export o f works by the two m asters 

 tin, assistant vice pre­ sident of the gallery, said the final disposition of 
Diego Rivera’s “ Lady of the Veil” and “ The Cat” and Jose Clemente Oroz- 
“ Advance” was 

“ still up in the air.” 
Miss Martin said she was informed that Mex­ ican 
President 
Jose 
Lopez Portillo discussed the pictures with Lula 
Olmeda, who runs the 
Diego Rivera 
Museum in Mexico City. 

She said she was told a representative from 
M edeo City would confer with her next Tuesday or 
Wednesday before the sale, which is scheduled for Thursday. 

Sotheby’s agreed to withdraw the pictures at 

 the request of the anon­ ymous collector, an 
American citizen who put them up for sale, who wishes to avoid possible future trouble with the 
Mexican government. 
Miss Martin said she also learned belatedly that the pictures were exported from Mexico 12 years ago, by which time a government permit was needed. 
A 
Mexican government decree in 
December 195o limited the export of works by the two masters. 
The Mexicans also

“ San Antonio’s Ram­ bling River Walk” is the title of an article by Ri­ chard Dunlap which ap­ pears in the May issue of

The author was in the city in January attending a meeting of the Society of 
American

Special attention is gi­ ven in the story to res­ taurants. river boat din­ ners and one-of-a-kind- shops. B ill Bailey of

Nixon: 
U.S. will flee Reds in NATO 

PARIS (AP) — Former 
President Richard M. 
Nixon says he would ex­ pect the United States to walk out of the North At­ lantic Treaty Organiza­ tion if the government of a member country became Communist. 
Nixon also said he would like to ride in the controversial Concorde supersonic jet and praised French Pre­ sident Valery Giscard d'Estaing in a segment of his interview series with 
David Frost to be aired 
Sunday in France. 
The postscript to the interviews was filmed especially for the French television network, which suggested the questions. 
According to the network's French trans­ lation, Nixon said: 
Reality 

“ I must stress —• and this is neither a threat nor a warning but a poli­ tical reality — and I am something of an expert in this field — that I know that at the very moment when the Communists enter NATO, the United 
States will walk out.” 
Nixon said he believed a U.S. administration could live with a situation where Communists enter into a French govern­ ment coalition, and could maintain working rela­ tions with such a French government in the same way it maintains working relations with Russia and 
China. 
But he said the Amer­ ican people and Congress might feel differently. 
Sensitive 

“ I don’t want to inter­ fere in French politics because the French are very sensitive on this point, but it would be very dishonest to deny that many American politicians, congress­ men, party leaders and so on would react very negatively if it became a question of dealing with 
France, our traditional ally, under a Socialist- 
Communist coalition regime.” 
Asked about the 
French-British superson­ ic airliner Concorde, 
Nixon said: “ I was in favor of Concorde. I w that it is not yet econ­ omically viable, but it is the plane of the future.”

Vesco victims will get funds 

NEW YORK (AP) - The 145,ooo shareholders in four mutual funds once controlled by fugitive finan­ cier Robert Vesco apparently will receive $123.8 million that the federal government says Vesco looted from the funds but which had been frozen since 1972 in a Canadian bank. 
Anderson, Russell Kill & dick, a New York law firm, said Friday that the Supreme Court of Ontario had approved settlement of a suit on Thursday, allowing the release of the money to the funds and their liquidators. 
The lawyers said the first distribution of money to shareholders would be made in July. 
The four mutual funds — Fund of Funds, IOS 
Growth Fund, Venture Fund andllT — are operated in Europe. 

By RON WHITE 

The opening of a new theater in San Antonio should be an occasion for rejoicing. 

But it’s difficult to find anything to rejoice about in the production of of 
“ Irma La Douce” at San 
Antonio 
Fine 
Arts 
Center. 

The center has pro­ duced several children’s shows, and “ Irm a,” which opened last wee­ kend, is its first venture into adult entertainment. 
It may be adult, but it is also amateur in ways that have been extinct in most 
San 
Antonio theaters — including amateur ones 
— for many years. 

The production is working under a handi­ cap. 
The space in 
McArthur Plaza on Na­ cogdoches Road where 
San Antonio Fine Arts 
Center produces its plays is outright to play pro­ duction The giant room has the acoustics of a gymnasium. And the performers being on the same level as the au­ dience creates a contin­ ual head-weaving as per­ sons try to get a good view of the actors. 

Can’t forget 

But theaters have be­ gun under Spartan con­ ditions before, and have given performances of 

 h k i w i n 
WW 

 such stirring quality as to make audiences forget the hardships under which they see the plays. 
But “ Irma” is not one of those shows. Although it tries hard to please — and might do so under less demanding condi­ tions — “ Irm a” never transcends its setting. 
The play is, first of all, an inoffensive musical about a French prosti­ tute, Irma, and her boy friend, Nestor. Jealous of her customers. Nestor pretends to be a wealthy old man who pays Irma for her exclusive ser­ vices. It is the type of show that will not stimu­ late. It should be com­ fortable, like sinking into a soft pillow. Any lumps are felt immediately. 
Lumpy 
And Richard Brown's direction is, to say the least, lumpy. The awk­ ward facilities of the center are made more awkward by clumsy and unnecessay set changes that have the actors car­ rying set props back and forth through the aisles. 
Brown’s handling of the actors is only slightly less awkward. The dialog often sounds as though the actors are leading up to a song — a sort of hear - comes - something coyness — regardless of w hether there is a musi-

 cal number coming up. 
In his choice of actors. 
Brown has done some good physical easting. 
Hon Hammel has the naive, young look appro­ priate to Nestor and the crew of underworld pimps have a consistent mean quality. But a play is not looks alone, and when the performers open their mouths they are usually reciting lines rather than playing characters, 
If there is a reason for rejoicing in “ Irma,” it would have to bt' over the discovery of 
Gayle 
Fleury as Irma. Repor­ tedly with little previous acting experience, she is attractive, at ease on stage and has a fine singing voice, the only one in the show' to over­ come the echoing acous­ tics. 
Spirit 
There is spirit and hard work in the show. 
There is effective use of a piano, acordian and drums. Some of the dance numbers, while not spectacular choreo­ 

 graphy, are arresting because of their energy. 
One can believe that everyone has tried hard to do a good show', but as much as the cast and director and anyone who wants theater to thrive locally might wish them well, in the end “ Irma" is an unsatisfactory theater experience. 
One should probably be suspicious when, before the show begins, the pro­ ducer, Sherron Beth 
Huffman, tells the au­ dience how hard ever­ yone has worked and even aaks them to sing 
“ Happy Birthday” to her husband. 
Knowledge of how hard a east works is irrelevant to the final production. 
Bringing in members of the family for birthday wishes is worse than ir­ relevant; it’s a signal that San Antonio Fine 
Arts Center is little more than a private, family affair. Theater, however, is for the public, but one suspects this production of “ Irm a” has little thought for the public’s reaction.

THEBIBLE 

No. 292. Obey the Laws 

The prophet Malachi spoke of God’s love and care for Israel, and of 
Israel’s defiance of God’s laws. He then turned to predict that there would come a time when God would judge the good men and the evil men. those who had served Him, and those who had not. 
“For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day thai cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.” (Malachi 4:1-2) 
“And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I com­ manded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judg­ ments.” (Malachi 4:3-4)

Critics over-react to effort creating TV f a m i l y hour 

The united front of re­ sistance to the attempt by the networks to create a family hour for a de­ creased dosage of sex and violence is a tragic example of over-react ion. 
Led by producer Nor­ man Lear who has a genius for producing entertaining shows aimed at undercutting every vestige of disci­ pline about a high view of sexuality, the a rtistic community is making a frontal attack on the right of the public or the networks to restrict ma­ terials unsuitable for fa­ mily viewing. The cry of objection is “ censorship’ and “ Hypocrisy.” 
The cry of censorship is not accurate. This mild step of agreeing to lim it violent and sexual sub­ jects during certain hours of the day is not censorship. It represents a belated concern in our society that the most powerful educational force in our children’s development is tele­ vision. 
The truth is that the airwaves belong to the public. In addition, there is no effective way to screen out or check ahead of time the content

Frustrated 

These elements add up to frustrated families be­ ing overwhelmed in their efforts to transm it to their children the stan­ dards they have ham­ mered out as healthy for themselves. Their fight to fulfill the responsibili­ ty of educating their children is being swal­ lowed up by a powerful communication medium transmitting often differ­ ing values. Its artists may cry for freedom of expression for them ­ selves. 
The parents cry for freedom to rear their 

 children according to their understanding of truth. 
There w ill always be im perfections and v u l­ nerability in any effort to exercise control over tin* content of our communi­ cation media. Accusa­ tions of inconsistency w ill be founded in fact. 
Evaluation of effects of certain types of v iewing are subject to conjecture. 
For instance a recent study of early evening hour television program­ ming was made by the 
U niversity of Pennsyl­ vania's 
Annenburg 
School of Communica­ tion. ll discovered “ a rela­ tively high incident of sexual innuendoes on sit­ uation comedies and va­ riety shows” iii these early evening hours. Re­ searchers concluded that 
“ this would seem to make such shows more appropriate for a mature audience.” 
In other words, more values may be transmit­ ted and fashioned in hu­ morous shows depicting persons approving of un­ acceptable sexual a tti­ tudes than in more ser­ ious shows dealing with

 the subject. When a cou­ ple is shown with social approval living in non- marriage or when homo­ sexual lifestyles or other kinkiness is treated in a flippant manner, the child is being taught more by unconscious communication than by conscious com m unica­ tion - 
Objectors to restraints in television scoff at the lameness and ineptitude of these show. They’re often right. We have not met the challenge to turn our genius toward pro­ ducing exciting and en­ tertaining shows that make decency attractive. 
What is needed is the will to do it. Our finest talent needs to be chal­ lenged to communicate and entertain in ways that are wholesome and healthy. If that can be true, then the TV waste­ land may yet “ bloom like a desert rose.” 
The B iblical truth is that we w ill ultim ately become what we think. 
(Philippians 4:8) If this is true, we had better work at m aking the words of our mouths and the m editation of our hearts acceptable in 
God’s sight.

Bexar bids due 
Monday 

The State Highway 
Commission w ill meet 
Monday in Austin to award an almost $1 m il­ lion seal coating project for District 15 which in­ cludes Bexar County. 

Apparent low bidder for the 121.4-mile project, involving 19 individual jobs in five counties, is 
Cloud Paving Co., Inc., of 
San Antonio, according to 
Garrett Wilson, District 
15 engineer. 

With seal coating, as­ phalt and cover stone are shot on the top surface, sealing the roadway base and sub-base from sur­ face intrusion of waler. 

Surface water can weaken a road and lead to pot holes or worse. 

Eight of the individual jobs w ill be in Bexar 
County. Other counties are: Kendall County, 4; 
Guadalupe County, 3; 
Wilson County, 2, and 
Comal County, 2. 

“ Depending on the contractor, construction usually starts two to four weeks after the contract is awarded,” Wilson said. 

The contractor an­ nounces his schedule of operations after a pre­ construction safety meeting with the high­ way commission.

Catholic schools losing enrollm ent 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK 
Enrollment in Roman Catholic parochial schools still is falling, dropping 3 per cent last year and continuing a 
12-year plunge that has driven a swelling proportion of one-time church pupils into the public schools. 
Over the period, de- „ 
« 
II e c a n n o t ha cc f r e e d o m of choice i f there is o n ly a pu b lic spite growing population, enrollm ent in Catholic elementary and high schools has declined about 4o per cent, from 
5.7 million to 3.3 million. 
The drop in the past year was 1o4,41o. 
The continuing shrink­ age, shown by the 'new 
1977 issue of the Official 
Catholic Directory, came amid an intensifying fi­ nancial squeeze on church-run schools, with parents who support them denied tax breaks for doing so, although they also pay public school taxes. 
Monoply 

The trend was cited recently by a leading of­ ficial of the Carter ad­ ministration as creating an educational monopoly 
— the public school sys­ tem — and limiting free choice in the schooling of 
American children. 
“ One of the most im ­ portant fundamentals of our 
Constitution is freedom of choice,” says the new director of the federal Community Ser­ vices A dm inistration, 
Graciela Olivarez. “ Bul we have been so in ­ timidated by the separa­ tion of church and that we are in conflict with the First Amendment. 
“ We cannot have freedom of choice if there is only a public school system. We must have that other system.” 
She told the recent cortlention of the Nation­ al Educational Associa­ tion in San Francisco that the double financial load on parents of private and church-school students, brought about by court interpretations, has made free choice in education “ quite limited in our country.” 
“ We oppose mon­ opolies ... yet when it comes to basics in preparing our most valuable asset — our 

 school system ' 

 children — we allow a monopoly — the public school system — to take over,” she said. 
She pledged efforts to change that process, em­ phasizing that church- run schools provide a 
“ savings” to taxpayers generally that has not been credited and that it would cost them approximately $4 billion more annually to accom­ modate in public schools the children now in church schools. 

A recent survey by the 
Public Action Council, a secular organization, of public and 
Catholic school systems in Illinois found that it costs, on the average, about IO times more per pupil to run public schools than it does Catholic schools.

 the Chicago public school system were $42.73 per pupil, while administra­ tive costs in the Catholic school system there was 
$4.1o per pupil, the study found.

Kenedy & Sons, also showed a growing proportion of lay teachers 
In church schools, the 1o6,844 of them ndw making up 64.3 per cent of all Catholic school teachers. They had constituted only 8.24 per cent in 1944. 
Overall church mem­ bership increased 443,88o to 49.3 million, or 22.8 per cent of the population, a fairly steady figure in recent times.

More bumps 

Okay, so the railroad fixed tho crossing on 
Military Drive near Zarzamora Street. 
It is real nice and smooth. 
So then the highway destroyers in the guise of highway fixers com e along and put these huge bumps on both sides of the crossing. 
Now, instead of the crossing ripping the wheels off your car. the roadway dot's. 
Would someone please explain what all this is about? lf this was on the North Side, it would be as smooth as a table top. Instead, we have to get the leftovers down here. 
Who can we complain to? 
SOUTH SI DHR 

You apparently have a short m em ory. 
Com ­ pared with the way the crossing was before the recent repairs, the pre­ sent situation is nearly glass smooth. 
Actually, we will admit that the raising of the tracks and the installa­ tion of new ties did make a sharper initial bump than usual. The highway people went out and tried to smooth out the road so it m atched the tracks more closely. 
Apparently they need to go back and take a look and see if it can be made a little smoother. 
We have contacted of­ ficials at the State De­ partment of Highways 

 im 
- * * 

 and Public Transporta­ tion and they will send some inspectors out to see if additional asphalt needs to be laid to build up the road surface on both sides of the cross­ ing. 
And. by the way, some of the worst crossings in town are found on North 
Side streets. There is no plot to make things more m iserable for 
South 
Siders. 
The crossings and their maintenance are the re­ sponsibility of the rail­ roads. So when you get upset about the crossing. go find yourself a nice diesel locomotive lo go kick — that might ease the frustration a bit. 

Fire rules, Part ll 

In your explanation of why Don Colson’s observa­ tions about the city policy of answering fire calls outside tin; city limits, there was something sort of left unanswered that bothered me. 
It also seemed to bother Colson. 
What happens if a building near the city limits is on lire and there is human life at stake and firemen from the city arrive and don’t know whether the building is in the city or not and so they don’t fight the fire and someone dies? 
Wouldn't this be a terrible tragedy? 
Shouldn’t the city instruct the firemen to fight fires where there is any doubt about w hether something is inside the city limits or not — at least to save people's lives? 
WONDERING 

Okay, this debate is obviously not over, bul part of the problem was caused because some of the statem ents being made about the city’s fire policy were the result of a lack of information. 
Fire Chief I. O. Mar­ tinez. who fielded a whole barrage of questions from 
A ction-E xpress about the policy, made it clear to us that the San 
Antonio Fire Department will not needlessly stand by and let human lives be lost or mistakenly NOT respond to a fire. 
On the other hand, the critics of the policy have to realize that the City of 
San Antonio cannot and should not be expected to respond to fires in the suburban communities. 
With $9o million in tax money at stake what happens when fire equip­ ment is tied up fighting a fire in a suburban area close to the city lim its and a fire breaks out in­ side the city limits in that same district? 
The fire departm ent officials feel their first obligation is to the resi­ dents of San Antonio. 
Chief 
Martinez said that because of the city’s strict policy of not re­ sponding to calls outside the city limits (except to city owned property like the CPS power plants which are in the county and to the military bases where the city had a co­ operative agreement) all of his men who are in 

 stations near the city li­ mits are fully briefed on the location of the city limits and of buildings which are on or near the city limit lines. 
“They know about 99.9 per cent of the tim e whether a structure is in or out of the city,” the chief said. 
And, in in stan ces where they don’t? 
“ We’ll fight the fire if there is any real doubt. 
We will continue to fight the fire until the subur­ ban guys arrive if we later find out it is not in the city,” the chief ex­ plained. 
And buildings which are part in and part out of the city limits DO get city fire protection. And fires which are out of the city but threaten proper­ ty in the city limits will also be fought bv the city firemen. 
So you see the city ’s policy is not as rigid and inflexible and cold-heart­ ed as it may seem. 
But to Colson, who ar­ rived at the fire on San 
Pedro Avenue only to see city firem en w atching from a safe d istance while smoke poured from the building, that was a bit of a shock which prompted his on-the-air remarks about the inci­ dent. He admits if the ci­ ty firemen had not shown up at all and he waited on the scene for the volun­ teers to arrive, none of the current controversy would have erupted. 

Branders books 

Would you please inform your readers w ho are jail officials that we have some law books that we would like to donate for their offenders. 
We also have some law textbooks. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recently ruled that all those persons in carcerated in the state, county and city jails have a right to legal reference works. Also, it may be possible that a small ACLU (American 
Civil Liberties Union) chapter m ay want some books. 
If the officials will write me al R O . Box 868, San 
Antonio, 78293, I will be in touch with them. 
MRS. ALBERT BERLER 
As usual, we cooperate fully with the Brandeis 
U niversity 
W om en’s 
Committee on these sorts of projects. 
Action-Express was in­ strumental in helping the 

Brandeis Women launch their national project to supply books to inmates in federal prisons. We hope this new local en­ deavor will be as successful.

Heart unit blockage is rare 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: Could you print something about pacemakers? I have one and am very careful of electrical appliances because I’m told they can interfere with their working. 
How dangerous are appliances? — M.K. 
The potential for interference from electricity was recognized soon after pacem akers cam e into use. 
There have been relatively few documented cases of serious interference, however. Modern units are g rea t im provem ents over ea rlier ones, and new 
Safety requirem ents m ake them effective in stru ­ ments for control of heart rhythm problems. 
Still, users are wise to be aw are of potential problems. The most publicized source recently has been the microwave oven, which is becoming almost a common household appliance. Leakage can occur around the d o o r s /so warnings are displayed pro­ minently. 
Other possible sources of electromagnetic leakage are the diathermy machines (for deep heat). They should be kept at least a yard away from the pace­ m aker. Surgical diatherm y (the burning needle), the X-ray m achine, high energy radios and tele­ vision and radar devices are other possible sources. 
The proper grounding of any electrical device is always important. 
If you are concerned (as you should be) consult with your cardiologist. He knows the track record of the type of the device you have. Some are m ore resistant than others, depending on age and m anu­ facturer. 
But by and large, problems with the pacem akers have been rare, m aking them safe and valuable instruments. 
Cholesterol 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: I’m interested in cholesterol and its relationship to my angina pain. I guess I’m one of the few rem aining butter freaks. But I’m told the cholesterol in butter makes it a no-no for me. 
What do you say? I am 41 years old. Also, I’d like your cholesterol booklet. I ’m sending 35 cents to you care of this newspaper along with a stam ped, self- addressed envelope. I hope it says I can continue using butter. — Mrs. T H. 
You’re in for a disappointment. 
Butter contains saturated fats, the kind that are sources of cholesterol. Oleo contains the other kind of fat (unsaturated), which is not high in cholesterol. lf your angina pectoris can be traced to arterial deposits (which it often is) then cholesterol reduction is in order for you. 
The odds are that if you are a butter lover you also favor other no-no foods, so the booklet may be a source of still other disappointments. In fact there are pages devoted to dietary do’s and don’ts. 
Also, don’t think that angina is as simple a m atter as eating high cholesterol foods or not eating them. 
It may require a changed lifestyle at the table and away from it. I really think you should be getting some guidance about that as much as about choles­ terol, so I’m sending you the angina booklet as well. 

Arthritis sufferers can be helped. Dr. Thosteson s booklet discusses many types of arthritis and related joint diseases as well as effective treatments and medications. For a copy of “ How You 
Can Control Arthritis," write to him in care of this newspaper. 
Enclose a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope and 35 cents.

' Busting Loose is one comedy that makes it 

GIG YO U N G , left and Robert Culp are featured in 
“ Spectre,” a suspense dram a at 8 p.m . Ch. 4. 

It took a while to decide what to call one of CBS’ mid-season entries on the television schedule. 
The original title was 
“ The Last Markowitz.” 
Then came “ On Your 
Own.” Finally, “ Busting 
Loose.” 
“ Busting 
Loose” seems to be one of the few new series that is draw ing an audience. 
Many were canceled after just a few weeks on the air. Others will play out the season, and then be shelved. The show will be renewed on CBS next 
September. 
“ Busting Loose’’ is the half hour comedy, seen 
Monday evenings on 
Channel 5 at 7:3o, follow­ ing “The Jeffersons.” It stars Adam Arkin, Pat 
Carroll, Jack Kruschen and Barbara Rhoades. 
When the story began, 
Lenny Markowitz (A r­ kin) decided it was time 

I

 to “ bust loose” from family and make his own way in the world, get his own apartment, job, and pursue his lifelong ambi­ tion to become a sports broadcaster. But mama and papa (Miss Carroll and Kruschen) have a hard time letting go. And this is making some in­ teresting ideas for episodes. 
The Arkin name is a familiar name to theater and moviegoers. Adam is the son of actor-director 
Alan Arkin. Incidentally, 
Alan showed up on an earlier episode of “ Bust­ ing Loose” as Lenny’s 

 grandfather. 
Adam was born in 
Brooklyn in 1956. As the son of an actor-director, he grew up in the show business atmosphere and decided early in his life that he would like to remain in that business. 
He attended 
New 
York’s Professional Chil­ dren’s School. 
He was 13 when he made his acting debut in a film short subject 
“ People Soup.” The film was produced by his father and won an 
Academy Award nomin­ ation. That would have been a big boost to an-

“ The Really Longest 

Day.” (R) Det. Fish meets the five young re­ sidents of his new group home and has to resolve a crisis when one of them holes up in the bathroom. 

The biggest trouble with a sure thing is the uncertainty. 
West bid today’s hand just as if he had a sure thing. He bid his only face card “up th the hilt" and when the hand was over, a series of suit preference signals produced a good penalty and justified 
West’s confidence. 
West was world champion 
Billy Eisenberg partnered by fellow L.A. expert, Eddie 
{Cantar Both are members of the 1977 U.S. International team, who will compete in 
Manilla this fall. 
T h e f a v o r a b l e vulnerability enticed West to open his flimsy preempt and after North-South competed, 
East bid the heart game over 
South's four diamonds. South had the same number of high card points that West had, so he thought he was entitled to bid again and bid five dia­ monds. West’s double was no 
“sure thing,” but West knew that East wouldn’t have bid four hearts without a good hand and West was hoping to get a club ruff. And how right ne was. 
The first suit preference came with the opening lead. 
West led the heart deuce, an obvious signal for a club shift, which East won with the king. East dutifully led back the club eight for West to ruff. The club eight also carried a message. It was a suit preference signal for the higher ranking side suit, spades. 
Declarer won the spade with dummy’s ace and could have saved a trick had he banged down dummy's ace of trumps. However, he felt that 
West s heroics had placed the

Legal immigrants are topic o f f6o minutes’ 

Legal aliens and the problems they encounter will be the topic of CBS’ “ 6o 
Minutes” Sunday, 6 p.m. Ch. 5. 
In order to enter the United States legally, aliens must have sponsors who will guarantee that they will not be­ come public charges for a period of five years. 
Yet, American taxpayers are spend­ ing millions of dollars supporting legal aliens — many of whom apply for and receive welfare and other benefits within months, sometimes even within days, of their arrival in this country. 
Co-editor Mike Wallace and pro­ ducer Martin Phillips examine this nationwide problem of legal aliens on welfare, focusing on Yonkers, N. Y., where thousands of Jordanian families have settled during the past 15 years. 
In Yonkers, Wallace and Phillips 

 learn that many sponsors renege on their obligations. And although the 
U.S. Immigration Law says that any alien in the U.S. who becomes a public charge should be deported, not one single alien receiving welfare benefits has been deported — because of a loophole in the law. 
In another segment this week, co-’ editor Morley Safer and producer Imre 
Horvath update their earlier report on dyslexia, a sensory learning disability characterized by visual difficulties in which images get mixed up as mes­ sages to the brain become garbled. 
The principal subject of their story is 
Kathy Rice, who delivered the saluta­ tory address at Columbia University’s 
School of Engineering and Applied 
Sciences comm encem ent exercises this past week. 

 yone whose thoughts were on a film career. 
He continued with his acting training, appeared in plays in the are a , traveled with a national company and did a cou­ ple of off-Broadway shows. Adam made his motion picture debut in 
1971 in “ Made for Each 
Other.” 
In 1974, the young actor m ade his move to 
California, leaving his family’s home in New 
York, to make it on his own. (Adam said during our interview that his father and mother separ­ ated when he was four. 
He lived with his mother until he was ll, then went with his father.) The good-looking 2o-year-old actor said his relation­ ship with his father is a close one and when he goes back to New York, he stays with his father and stepmother and two brothers 
Brothers 

“ Matthew is 16 and serious about acting,” said Adam. “ He even has an agent. (Matthew has appeared in a “ Kojak” episode.) Tony is 9, the youngest, has a good technical mind. I think he could do anything he puts his mind to.” 
It was in 1974 that 
Adam got his first good television role. He played 
Devon Scott’s boyfriend on “We’ll Get By.” That followed with guest-star­ ring roles on such popular series as 
“ Hawaii 
Five-O ,” 
“ H arry O ,” “ Barney 
Miller” and 
“ Happy 
Days.” 
Both Pat Carroll and 
Jack Kruschen are old­ timers in show business. 
Jack told us this was his 
13th pilot. “ It has a lot of class,” he stated. "I en­ joy it.” 
Kruschen was born in 
Winnipeg, Canada, but he grew up in California, attending 
Hollywood 

A D A M ARKIN s t a r s in “ Busting 
Loose” 

High. He started his car­ eer on radio, while he was still a high school student. During World 
War II, Kruschen helped found the Armed Forces 
Radio Service. After his m ilitary service, he became involved in Lux 
Radio Theater for some time. 
Pioneer 
Kruschen is a televi­ sion pioneer, appearing on many of the early productions such as 
“ Dragnet,” “ Rifleman," 
“ The Danny T hom as 
Show,” 
“ I 
S p y,” 
“ Playhouse 9o,” “ G.E. 
T h e a te r,” and m any more. On film, Kruschen received an Academy 
Award nom ination as best supporting actor for his portrayal of Doctor 
Dreyfuss in 
“ The 
Apartment.” 
Pat was born in 
Shreveport, La., but also was brought up in Los 
Angeles. Her first brush with professional enter­ tainm ent cam e as a secretary in the sound effects department of a radio station in Hol- lyw'ood. She had aspired to be a serious actress but her boss advised that she become a comedienne. 
What a break for her audiences. 
Her p a r­ ticular brand of comedy 

 has kept audiences laughing for many years. 
She, too, has appeared on many television series as guest or regular, in­ cluding “ The Red But­ tons Show,” “The Danny 
Thom as Show ," with 
Jimmy Durante, George 
Gobel, Ann Sothern and the "Sid Caesar’s Hour,” for which she received an 
Emmy Award for best supporting actress in 
1956. 

Said 
Pat, 
“ Doing television comedy, for 24 years as a performer, tho change is m inim al. 
Audiences are audiences. 
They don’t change. Peo­ ple want to laugh. I hope this show will help ser­ vice that need for laughter." 

Due to a schedule change, episodes of 
“ Busting Loose” p re ­ viously announced for 
May and June have been pre-empted.

G reen Spring Valley lets you express yourself. 
First, you select one of its beautiful homesites; then, appoint the builder of your choice to con­ struct your dream home. 
Dream home 
What a wonderful place 
Green Spring Valley is for your d ream home. 
One reason is that this prestige com m unity of strik in g ly handsom e contemporary homes en­ joys, all to itself, a 
3o-acre, v irtually u n­ spoiled Nature Park of giant oak trees and open green meadow. 

G reen Spring Valley developers have put in a spectacular swimming pool complete with wa­ terfall, rock-lined walk­ ways and an island in the middle, as well as three professional size lighted tennis courts fenced in with nylon nets that keep balls from getting lost yet don’t block the view. Also, a spacious rock-and-redwood party cabana has full facilities for social doings. 

H om esites at G reen 
Spring Valley are almost miniature Nature Parks in them selves: m any have oak groves; others, graced by splendid old trees. The rolling terrain offers site purchasers an exciting opportunity to build homes of true ori- 

BOB JONES 

 ginality and distinction, taking full advantage of tree placem ent and slopes. A purchaser may select his own builder or one of the builders of the im pressive hom es a l­ ready completed at the subdivision. 
Located only 6.2 miles and about nine minutes north of N.E. Loop 41o on 
W etmore Road, Green 
Spring Valley is near everything: country clubs, Canyon Creek and 
Thousand Oaks; North 
E ast D istrict schools, 
Regency Place Elemen­ tary, Garner Middle and 
McArthur High (a fourth is scheduled for future construction); shopping, 
North Star and Central 
Park Malls; post office;, and hospital. In addition, land has been set aside, alongside Green Spring 
Valley, for commercial tenants such as conven­ ience stores. 
Green Serine Valley’s location is advantageous for yet another important reason. Although it lies just outside the San An­ tonio city limits so no city taxes need bt* paid, resi­ dents still enjoy county- maintained roads as well as city water and sewer lines. This situation is expected to continue for the next few years until the area is annexed into the city proper. In the meantime, however, re­ sidents are saving about 
$3o a month in taxes (on the basis of a $5o,ooo house). 
Safety rates high on 
Green Spring V alley’s list of priorities. Street layout, for example, is designed to m inim ize traffic volume, and, par­ ents of young children should note, the Nature 
P a rk can be reached from any part of the com m unity w ithout crossing any m ajor streets. In addition, the entire area is patrolled nightly by security guards. 
H om esites at G reen 
Spring Valley sta rt at 
$8,ooo; those adjacent to the Nature Park range from $15,ooo to $17,ooo. 
Visitors are cordially in­ vited to “ come out and see what Hill Country living is like” and to look over the desirable home­ sites still available. 
Jones goes to seminar 

Bob Jones, Realtor, a m e m b e r of the Texas 
Real Estate Commission, recently attended annual joint meetings of the Na­ tional Association of Real 
Estate License Law Offi­ cials and the National

During the meetings, 

Jones participated in several joint committees and heard talks by leaders in the field of en­ ergy conservation, m em bers of Congress and economists.

W IL S O N G A R D E N S fe a tu re s h o m e s b y b u ild e r Ben W ilso n 
Wilson Gardens features garden homes by Wilson 

Wilson G ardens, a re­ cent, exclusive resid en ­ tial are a of custom ized homes built by developer 
Ben Wilson, will hold an­ o th e r sh o w in g of two co m p leted m o d els this weekend. 

The models, found on a private cul-de-sac named 
Cork Cove, a re striking but m erely serve as ex­ a m p le s of th e kind of cu sto m q u a lity Wilson can b u ild for th e new neighborhood. The com ­ pleted homes also are for sale and priced from the low $9os. 
Six sites 
■ Wilson offers six other h o m e s ite s in his tree- filled c o m m u n ity in which he plans to custom build homes designed for m in im a l m a in te n a n c e and placed on lots which would require the same. 
As one would expect in th is p rice ra n g e , the hom es c o n ta in m any umenties, and Wilson has taken c a u tio n not to overlook any d etails in the cu s to m q u a lity of 

 th e se s u p e rb ly built homes. 
The im m e n s e hom es here are called garden homes because they fea­ ture a private patio with low-maintenance yards. 
N otew orthy is th a t the patio is accessible from se v eral liv in g or work areas of the house. In one model, even a wet bar is alm ost a d jac en t to the patio. 
Each m odel boasts a large single living area, three spacious bedrooms, sp a cio u s d in in g a re a 
( s e p a ra te d ) and rea r- entry garages with elec­ tric door openers. 
One of th e ho m es is p re-w ire d for b u r g la r alarm system s. Each is pre-plumbed for central vacuum systems and has an in te rc o m sy ste m th ro u g h o u t. E a c h fe a ­ tures privacy fences. 
W ilson h as not overlooked en e rg y -sa v ­ ing c o n s tru c tio n w hile b u ild in g th e s e lu x u ry homes. They contain in­ sulated hot water pipes, a full nine inches of insu­ lation in storage attics, 
Housing supply, demand stay high 

SPECIAL TO THE GOLDEN TWINS 
LONG BEACH, Calif. 
— Both supply and de­ mand for single-family housing will rem ain re­ latively “ strong and vi­ brant* ’ over the long term , contrary to many 
“ criers of doom ,” Philip 
B. Branson, senior vice president of Ticor Title 
Insurers, told the local 
Board of Realtors here recently. 
In ;i sneech entitled 
“ Will the Single-Family 
Home Survive?” , B ran­ son aa id the c u r r e n t frenzy of escalated de­ mand in prices can be expected to moderate and again equal the normal ra te of in fla tio n , but long-term dem and will not diminish rapidly. 
‘Adaptable’ 

“ A basic factor in our analysis fur tho demand for the single-family home is one that we can ’t measure: desire. 
No m atter what the govern­ ment planners tell us we should w an t, it is m y firm belief that the aver­ age A m e ric a n of this g e n e ra tio n w an ts and w ill make sacrifices for a single-family home,” 
Branson stated. 
“ When h o m e b u y ers c a n ’t stretch their inco­ mes any further, when they c a n 't d ev o te a h ig h e r p e r c e n ta g e of their income to shelter, w e’re going to sec a li­ m itation of the overall price in c re ase s of re si­ d en tial resa le. 
Eventually there will be a ’limit to the amount of incom e that can be d e­ voted to ownership . . . and we will see the ces­ sation of the rapidly es­ calating prices of hous­ ing but not an end to the dem and,” he stated. 
“ T he hom e ow ner knows that investment in real property is his best hedge a g a in st inflation now and in the future,” 
Branson opined. 
He cited the explosion the singles m arket as an example. “ People in the home buying m arket are getting m arried later . . . and d iv o rced e a rlie r. 
T hey a re not sa tisfie d with a o a rtm e n t living, and our tax structure makes it im perative for 
I hem to get into a home ownership position.” 
A nother factor which lie said has to be watched is the tremendous expan­ sion in d o lla rs being spent for additions and a lte r a tio n s to e x is tin g frames. “ This is definite­ ly going to im p a c t the 

 velocity of re s id e n tia l resale turnover once we g et p ast the c u r r e n t frenzy,” he said. 
“ Over the long term , however, we have a rela­ tively stead y supply of resale hom es available for sale. There are short­ te rm fun ctio n s at play here ... but. generally speaking, I think we can co n sid er the supply of homes up for resale con­ stant,” he added. 

Addressing the issue of providing affordable housing for low- income fam ilies now v irtu a lly excluded from the hous­ ing m a rk e t, 
B ranson said, “ T he A m eric an public at all incom e le­ vels, wants to own single- familv housing, and 
I believe the governm ent will be forced to assist lower income families in some form. 
“ One of th e key e le ­ ments in the future of the single - family home is the fact that right now, today, g o v e rn m e n t agencies and financial institutions have on the drawing boards a m ulti­ tude of new methods of financing so that tomor­ row ’s hom e ow ner can afford the monthly cost of shelter. The g rad u ated payment in variable rate

 m o rtg a g e , the re v e rse annuity and deferred in­ te re s t a re som e e x a m ­ ples. What is im portant is we will be seeing new and d iffe re n t ty p e s of financing.” 
Looking at the Supply sid e of the e q u atio n , there w ill be a significant single-family home is hom es over th e long term, Branson predicted. 
“ The level of purchase will be h ig h e r on the eco n o m ic sc a le , the hom es m ay be s m a lle r and m ore efficient and there will be, certainly, new and different ways of financing, but the supply will be there to meet the dem and.” 

B ran so n co n clu d e d , 
“ We will see a trem en ­ dous need for continuing education and adaptation on the part of all of us in the field, but the market for our services will be there. Private-ownership of real property and spe­ cifically , the hom e owner, is the foundation of American society.”

4oo1 residences succeed 
4 oo1 seen as success by builders 

A record of $2^ million in residential real estate sales in only HO days represents tremendous success for any de­ veloper. When the entire project occupies a total of 
1.6 acres, the sales fi­ gures are even more startling. 
These are the facts that, unquestionably, de­ monstrate the over­ whelming success and acceptance of San Anton­ io’s unique tower, penth­ ouse arui townhome com­ munity, 4oo1. 
Seemed risky 

Building an exclusive residential project like 
4oo1 seemed risky to some. But far-sighted men at the Callaway 
Corp. knew that, because of ensuing economic res­ traints, the opportunity to build such a commun­ ity would not present itself again. The archi­ tectural and engineering triumph of its planners, 
4oo1 is now a financial success as well. 
The builders correctly pinpointed the need for a residential lifestyle never before available in 
San Antonio as one that could free the discerning resident from home maintenance for travel and other personal pur­ suits. It is the worry-free lifestyle of a totally se­ cure, private and per­ sonal residence which brings San Antonians to 
4oo1 as a permanent home. 

Marketing team David 
Gruber and John Sowell explain, “ Our residents derive great peace of mind knowing they live in a totally secure and private community. 
Plus, 4oo1 offers them the contentment of living within serene and simply elegant surroundings which reflect their success.” 
Recessed, covered bal­ conies open onto breath­ taking vistas of the sur­ rounding area. 
The charming San An­ tonio Country Club and the adjoining golf course 

 are seen from the east, while an uninterruptp view of the San Antonio skyline sits south of the complex. 
The west view over­ looks the serene panora­ ma of Brackenridge 
Park, the slowly winding 
San Antonio River arui 
Olmos Basin. The peace­ ful Incarnate Word cam­ pus, with the Texas Hill 
Country roaching into the distance, lies north. 
The unhurried, leisur­ ely and secure 4oo1 li­ festyle centers around a full-time resident manager and staff who handle the time-consum­ ing details of mainten­ ance, groundskeeping and other domestic chores. 
Flowers for the table, tickets to the opera, maid service, and even cater­ ing for a large party or secretarial service are a simple phone call away. 
The experienced staff can coordinate timely details of travel arrange­ ments as well — ever­ ything from reservations to caring for plants dur­ ing any length trip. 
Uniformed doormen greet you under the porte-cochere, assist with packages, if needed, and park your car in the guarded subterranean parking garage. 
Electronic surveillance and sophisticated locking systems, monitored around the clock at the lobby security control center and reinforced by a roving guard in uni­ form, are designed to provide maximal protec­ tion for every resident and‘residence. 
The $5 million sales lo date substantiate the 4oo1 lifestyle’s quickly growing acceptance among San Antonians. 
With more than half of all tower residences now sold and a full schedule of activities planned for 
Summer, 4oo1 is expect­ ed to be sold out by the end of the year. 
The project is located at 4oo1 N. New Braunfels 
Ave. and is shown by ap­ pointments only. 
Conventional terms bettered 

SPECIAL TO THE GOLDEN TWINS 
WASHINGTON - Pri­ vate mortgage insurance has proven to be an ef­ fective alternative to go­ vernment financed housing programs by do­ ing it better, faster and more economically. 

Those were the words of Max H. Karl, chair­ man of the board of 
MGIC Investment Corp. and its principal sub­ sidiary, Mortgage Guar­ anty Insurance Corp. 
Key role 
Speaking to the Inter- 
American Savings and 
Loan Conference in Wa­ shington, D. C. recently, 
Karl said the private mortgage insurance in­ dustry has played a key role in making housing available to persons who otherwise couldn’t afford it. 
He said that in the past 
2o years private mort­ gage insurance helped nearly 3 million families 

 purchase a home by making low down pay­ ment mortgage funds available. 
“ The industry guaran­ teed 13 per cent of all one- to four-family mort­ gage originations in the 
United States in 1976, with a dollar volume of 
$14.6 billion,” Karl said. 
He noted that since 
196o federal programs, including FHA and VA* have grown by an annual average of 5.6 per cent, while private mortgage insurance has averaged u growth of 37Vfe per cent.* 
“ The privately insured home today is more flex­ ible, more dynamic, more market-oriented and holds greater appeal for lending institutions and their customers,’’ 
Karl said. 
In addition to helping the home buyer, lending institutions can avail themselves of the Secon** dary Market capabilities such as those offered by 
MGIC, he said.

D ise a se s a sso cia ted with these weather conditions really play havoc on our vegetable plants. Of course, not all diseases result directly or indirect­ ly from wet weather, but many do. 

On spotting diseases 

The information in today’s column on recognizing vegetable diseases was taken from an article written by Dr. 
Je r r a l Johnson, an Extension plant pathologist at Texas A&M University. 
Leaves have definite spots, white growth or other abnormal symptoms: 
•Upper side of leaves has white, powdery growth. Common on English peas, squash, cucumbers and beans: 
Powdery mildew. 
•Leaves have reddish-brown raised blisters not larger than Vs inch that deposit a reddish-brown or orange co­ lor on white cloth when rubbed across blister. Common on beans and sweet corn: Rust.

Great America homes. 
Just ask any of our home­ owners. 

 dSaed^on't be surprised if someone tells you how great your Great America nome looks. Because at 
Great America, we believe you can see the difference quality makes. 
In our garden kitchens, with handfinished cabinets and top quality appliances. In our roomy living areas, with vaulted cathedral ceilings, built-in bookcases and woodburn- ing fireplaces. In our lavish ceramic tile baths, with marble vanities and decorator appointments. 
Even in our generous mas­ ter suites, with private baths and walk-in closets. 
Everywhere you look, there is careful attention to design, styling, practi­ cality and energy-effi- ciency. 
But that's only the in­ side story. Outside, Great 
America homes are strik­ ingly individualistic. Each home is designed for its particular homesite. Some are traditional, others reflect the informality of 
California styling. Some have soaring rooflines,

Benefits Available to 

U.S. Veterans 

Two of the greatest im pedim ents to buying a home these days ore stiff dow n paym ent re ­ quirem ents and high m ortgage interest rates. 

Fortunately, some 
27 m illion veterans, who served in the arm ed fortes since the beginning of W orld W ar ll, qualify for below m arket m ortgage interest rates as well as much less tringent down paym ent re ­ quirem ents. 

The program of the 
Veterans 
Ad­ m inistration is best know n as the VA no down poym ent loan program . Under it, the govern­ ment guarantees lenders up to 
6 o % or 
$17,ooo, whichever is less, of a loan made to a veteran to purchase, construct, alter, im ­ prove or repair a home or condom inium unit approved by the VA. 

Because up to $ 1 7 ,SOO of a loan is guaran­ teed by the governm ent, the lender, in most cases, can provide the loan to the veteran w ithout a dow n paym ent. Th# am ount of the m ortgage loan, of course, is determ ined by the borrow er s income and credit w orthiness. 

Interest rates on VA-insured loans usually run quite a bit lo w er than conventional m ortgage rates. The present VA rate is 8 % . 

Here are some other facts about VA guaranteed m ortgage loans-. 

• Any VA-approved lending institution (savings and loan associations, m utual savings banks, banks, insurance com panies, credit unions or m ortgage companies) m ay process a VA loan. 

• The repaym ent period of a VA loan m ay run as long as 3o years. 

• Before a home can be sold under the VA program , it has to be appraised by the VA to determ ine its fair m arket value. The am ount of the m ortgage cannot exceed the appraised value of the house, lf the purchase price exceeds the appriased value, the difference m ay be covered by a down paym ent. 

• The VA w ill inspect the hom e w hile it is under construction to ensure that it meets accepted stan­ dards of good construction. 

• The VA w ill assist a veteran in handling valid com plaints to correct any construction defects. 

• In legislation signed into law in 1974, VA loan guarantee lim its w ere raised to $ 1 7 ,SOO from 
$ 1 2 ,SOO. This lim it is raised periodically to take into account increases in housing costs. 
• The 1974 legislation also allow s a veteran to use his VA benefits more than once. For exam ple, say you used the VA program to buy your first home in 1955. Once that m ortgage hot been paid off, you could sell that home and qualify for another VA loan on a new home. 

• lf your VA loon obligation has not been paid off or if the home you purchased through VA has not been disposed of (either by sale or casulatv loss), you are still entitled to use the difference betw een the benefits you have used ana the new lim it or benefits. 

 fo r exam ple, say you purchased a home through VA in 196S. You used the loan guarantee benefit to the th en -m axim al lim it of $7,5oo. You now wish to purchase another home to be occupied by you os a residence buy you don’t w ant to sell the first one. You are e n titled to use up to a $1o ,oo o VA loan guaran­ tee on the new purchase. ($ 1 7,5 oo less $ 7 ,5 o o is $ 1o ,oo o.) 

• lf you sell your current VA-purchased home to another veteran who w ill use his VA benefits to take over your present m ortgage balance, then your VA benefits are restored fully to the $ 17 ,5o o lim it. 

The first step fo r veterans in getting a VA loan is to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility from the VA. 
Check a t the nearest VA regional office for this application and for additional inform ation regarding VA home loons.

It s hard to do justice its; and stainless steel swimming pool are using words to describe ft ay 
Elliso n ’s 
Tanglewood in northwes­ tern San Antonio. 
You have to see the wooded landscapes and rolling hillsides to appreciate the rustic feeling of freedom and careful living that comes from the minute you drive through the luxur­ ious overhanging oaks fram ing the en­ tranceway. 
At heart 
Located within easy driving distances of the neighboring UTSA cam­ pus, the imposing USAA complex and the splendid medical facilities of the 
South Texas Medical

Innovative, contempor­ ary designs by Ray E l­ lison architects make 
Tanglewood an interest­ ing combination of three- and four-bedroom, one- and two-story homes beginning in the low $4os and available with VA, 
FU A and conventional financing. 
Fireplaces, featured in most plans, bring crack­ ling warmth and rustic glamor to crisp 
Tanglewood evenings. 
But rustic charm is mixed with contempor­ ary convenience in beautiful and functional kitchens that transform cooking chores into cu­ linary adventures. 
Rich, handcrafted wood cabinetry; self­ cleaning doulble-oven electric ranges; dish­ washers and disposal un­ 

 sinks and fixtures all combine to allow kitchen chores to be performed with more fun and less fatigue. 
Although the benefits of Tanglewood living are many and varied for housewives and mothers, children and teenagers from the wooded subdi­ vision enjoy outstanding educational facilities of the Northside School 
District, along with in­ teresting and diverse so­ cial programs and extra­ curricular activities for young people of all ages. 
For weekend or even­ ing recreation in the great Tanglewood out­ doors, tennis courts and 

 nearby 
For those whose enter­ tainment tastes lean to the night life, discoth­ eque dancing and unique cuisine abound in excit­ ing northwestern San 
Antonio, with the most popular spots located on­ ly minutes away via ex­ pressways.

Tanglewood sales office, where professional and courteous Ray Ellison representatives are ready to assist you, drive on N.W. Ill IO past N.W. 
Loop 41o to De Zavala 
Road and follow it west until you reach the dis­ tinctive Tanglewood en­ trance.

Controls need testing 

Have you tested your low-waler cutoff this year? If your house is heated by steam and, in some cases with hot- water heat, there is a cutoff control on the out­ side of the boiler, with an 

 instruction tag affixed to it. This control prevents your burner from oper­ ating if there is insuffi­ cient water in the boiler, and should be tested once or twice a year by your serviceman.

Dr. Thomas Green- burg, research professor in free enterprise at St.

Builders Association at its monthly meeting 
Tuesday, May 24, start­ ing at 6:3o p.m. in its headquarters building auditorium. 
Greenburg will speak on “ The Challenge to the 
Free Enterprise Sys­ tem.” 
The free enterprise system is being attacked by some and defended by others, Greenburg re­ ports by stating, ‘‘On the one hand, the free enter­ prise system is charac­ terized as greedy, dis­ honest, . irresponsible and even immoral; on the other hand, it is said to be the finest system de­ signed by the human be­ ing to take care of his economic and material needs.” 
Greenburg w ill ad­ dress the differences. He has observed that people

EXPRESS CAPITOL BUREAU 
AUSTIN - Gov. Dolph 
Briscoe signed 58 differ­ ent pieces of legislation into law Friday, includ­ ing seven bills sponsored by members of the Bexar 
County legislative dele­ gation. 
The Bexar lawmakers’ bills and their original sponsors are: 
• HB591 by Hep. Ron 
Bird of San Antonio. 
HB591 will permit Bexar 
County and counties with populations over 8oo.oo1) to construct and lease parking lots in the vicin­ ity of the county courth­ ouse. The bill becomes effective in 9o davs. 
• 
BB7o4, HB7o5 and 
HB7o6 by 
Rep. 
Don 
Cartwright of San Anton­ io. The three bills pertain to the regulation of in­ surance agents — two in­ creasing license fees and the third setting out edu­ cational standards. 
HB7o4 would require an insurance agent to complete such require­ ments as learning the principles of insurance, licensing and regulatory law before being eligible for licensing. The bills take effect in 9o days. 
• 
HBI788 by Bird would help cut down on the number of rosters which voters must sign at the polls during elec­ tions. 
MB 1788 authorizes the 
Secretary of State to pro­ mulgate a combination of fewer poll lists required to be signed by voters. 
The bill becomes effec* 
. tive in 9o days. 
• SB657 by Sen. John 
Traeger of Seguin auth­ orizes an increase for Ii- 
Drug cache discovered 
MIAMI (AP) - A 
21-year-old Dallas wai­ tress was turned over to 
Dade County authorities 
Friday after 82 grams of cocaine were found on her body, a U.S. Customs spokesman said. 
Street value of that amount of cocaine was put at 
$41,ooo.

By DEBORAH WESER 
Commissioners Court decided Friday to speed up its tax appraisal case load to complete work before the early August deadline facing it this year. 
Commissionere Court functions as the county’s 
Board of Equalization and currently hears com­ plaints only twice a week and with a load of abomt al) eases each day. 
About 2.ooo complaints have been lodged bul only about 55 per cent are turning up for review, staff reported. 
At the urging of County Judge Blair Reeves, the load will be raised to about IOO cases a day with the full court operating as two separate equalization hoards. 
Ban k 

Commissioners also agreed with Reeves in setting a I p.m. June 15 open hearing on collective com­ plaints about property appraisals from local hanks. 
A similar hearing was set for June 17 in response to complaints raised by local auto dealers. The full court will sit for both collective complaints, they agreed. 
Commissioners meanwhile reversed an earlier position and agreed to go ahead with preliminary study of possible joint development of a local go­ vernment complex downtown with the City of San 
Antonio. 
The move does not commit Bexar County to a joint venture hut only to study the benefits or disadvan­ tages, Reeves indicated. 
Objected 

Com. A. J. Ploch objected to the proposal because he first wants to know where the city stands on the idea. 
The work. as a planning exercise, will he handled by the consortium of architects hired earlier this week to begin looking at renovation efforts for the existing building. 
They are Ford. Powell & Carson, John F. Williams and Humberto Saldana, in association. 
The planning work is not to exceed a cost of 
$23,75o, Commissioners Court agreed. 
The planning idea came initially from Com. Jeff 
Wentworth and was opposed earlier this week by 
Coms. Albert Bustamante and Tom Stolhandske as well as Ploch.

Antarctic cold halts coffee futures decline 

 from here is in the hands of Jack Frost. 
Most equatorial cocoa plantations in Bahia, 
Brazil, are safe from the bouts of cold that occa­ sion ally threaten the southern coffee growing regions, but cocoa fu ­ tures were equipped with enough incentive of their# own to relaunch an up­ ward move which pushed through previous over­ head b a rrie rs at 17.5 cents per pound. 
Apparently, delays in expected shipments from 
West Africa have caught some cocoa dealers in 
London short handed. 
No pun intended be­ cause these dealers are long on their term inal and may be moved to take d e live ry if the awaited ships do not arrive before May’s ex­ p iration on the th irty - first. 

Coffee futures, which had been reflecting the initial phases of a sharp cutback in U.S. coffee consumption, abruptly terminated their decline when a cold antarctic air mass unexpectedly scaled the peaks of the 
Andes and brought scar- ingly low temperatures into tin1 outskirts of the southernm ost coffee plantations in Brazil. 
Futures responded locked lim it up for two days nervously awaiting damage estimates while early speculation and w orried im a gin atio n claimed as much as 25 per cent of the trees had been frostbitten. 

The market barely had time to heave a sigh of relief on news that frost damage was at most negligible when a second frost warning was issued

Psychic predicts Nixon will rise again 

I Saturday ! 
^^^EX PR ESSN EW S- 
SCENE 
May 21 1977 

By LIWA PERMARAJU 
P sych ics—that term leaves different impres­ sions with different peo­ ple. 
To some, these “ m edium s” a re th e d ev il's m essen g er. 
O thers see them as m iracle w orkers. However, scientists see psychics as subjects for intensive experiments. 

Today, there are few indivi­ duals with extra sensory per­ ception (ESP) willing to work with scientists to explore the powers of the mind. 
Sean Harribance, a native of the West Indies island of Trin­ id ad , is one ESP se n sitiv e w orking with parapsych o lo ­ gists at Duke University and the Foundation for Research on the N ature of Man in N orth 
Carolina. 
Harribance is here this week 

He claim s th at form er President R ich ard 
Nixon w ill rise to political pow er once again, 
San Francisco will break o ff into the ocean by 198o an d a cure for cancer will be dis- covered in 1983. 

SEAN HARRIBANCE 
... looking ahead 

 lecturing an d conducting classes in mind control. He has amazed experts with his ability 
♦o predict future happenings. 
Among h is fu tu re pred ic­ tions, H arribance says the en­ ergy crisis is a political man­ euver and th at the U.S. has plenty of oil and gas to go ar­ ound. 
“ When the public finds out what’s going on, another na­ tional scandal will develop,” says Harribance. 
He also claim s that former 
President R ichard Nixon will rise to p o litical power once again. San F ra n c isc o will break off into the ocean by 198o and a cure for cancer will be discovered in 1985. 
Barriers 

“ For years people refused to believe ESP ex isted ,” H arri­ bance says. “ However, parap­ sychologists have come through and broken the barriers to the public. They no longer have to prove them selves.” 
Parapsychology is the a t­ tempt to apply scientific meth­ ods of investigation to the study of phenomena which do not fol­ low (and in some cases contra­ dict) the p resen tly accepted laws of science. 
Scientific research centering on the m ind is becom ing increasingly accepted. 
“I’ve always had a great re­ spect for science,” he explains. 
“ It’s a way to find out why things happen the way they do.” 
The dark-eyed hypnotic Har­ ribance helDS m any types of 

 people through his readings. 
F ro m p o litician s to housew ives, people w ant to know what the future holds for them. 

“ U sually i f s women u'ho com e and see me the m ost. 
M atters relating to relatio n ­ ships with men, m arriage and sex seem to be the most com­ mon questions.” 

Five senses 

H arrib an ce a ttrib u te s his powers as an extension of the m ind’s five senses. 

“ T h ere is a d efin ite link between science and powers of the mind. I have ESP but it took me tame to develop—I bad to cu ltiv ate my sk ills through years of practice.” 

When asked if he felt most people have a degree of ESP 
Harribance replied, “ Most de­ finitely. 

“ As a psychic I had one talent w hen I first cam e to th is country, now I have 25. 

“ You see. the mind is a sys­ tem with many mind channels. 
M ind control is a discip lin e that can be found in each one of us.” 
Harribance also believes ifs not that simple for people to m aster their destiny. 
“ I believe a person can con­ trol about HO per cent of his destiny—the other 4o per cent is karm a.” 
K arm a is the Hindu belief 

 that destiny is determined by one's previous acts. 

“ Karma is hard to explain to people because so much of this philosophy is open for ques­ tioning. However, I do believe one reaps the results of past actions and therefore cannot undo what has already taken place.” 
Imbalanced 

H arrib an ce explains that some people who come to him for counseling are emotionally imbalanced. 
“ Those people should see psychiatrists and not me. These people cannot always be told the forecast I see in their fu­ tures. 
“ If I tell them something that will really disturb them, they may react in many ways—often in a d estru ctiv e m anner to themselves.” 

He says his powers are not always on the same level. Dif­ ferent things such as stress, fatigue and anger affect the* way he perceives situations. 
“ Often I am left drained after a reading and when that occurs, my mind becomes blank.” 

Meditation and breathing ex­ ercises help 
Harribance to maintain a concentrated level of mind control. 
“ Meditation is important to make the mind calm and alert. 
Don’t discount the gurus and teachers who talk about this, it is im portant.” 
Harribance will continue to help re se a rc h e rs probe the mind and its tricks. He will stay in the U.S. providing help to those who need him and to science—an integral part of his lifestyle. 
“ Science is a base for all explanations. Answers will bt* found soon to m any problems—that’s a prediction I can prom ise.”

Abernathy's own recipes. 

“ I'm a big believer in re c ip e s ,’’ notes A b e r­ n ath y . “ The se c re t to good food is the b e st in g re d ie n ts, a good tried-and-true recipe and paying attention.” 

Specialties 

The dinner menu lists six specialties, and I have m anaged (spread o u t! over a couple of meals) to try four of them! 

My favorite was the 
French onion soup in a crock with crouton and m elted cheese ($1.45). 
The stuffed mushrooms 
($2.45) were unusual to me as they are filled with chunks of rare tenderloin and served with a mush- room-wine sauce. 

My husband’s Chateau­ 

 briand ($9.95) was a lo­ vely medallion of beef, but my Poulet S aute 
(chicken Cordon Bleu style , $6.45) was a disap­ pointment. 
A bernathy h as been working on the Cordon 
Bleu recipe, how ever, and says he h as “ im ­ proved on it considera­ bly” since I dined there. 
He also has added Pou­ let Supreme, which is the sixth specialty and has becom e very p o p u lar with his customers. 
I also sampled the filet of turbot ($6.45). It is a mild fish served with a plain white sauce th at really needs a squeeze of the fresh lemon on the plate to perk it up. 
“ I think turbot is not as glam orous because i f s available,” notes A ber­ nathy, who chose it for his menu because it is less seasonal than other fish. 
All entrees are served with a loaf of warm bread and a very nice chilled salad. The house dress­ ing is a vinaigrette type and all d re ssin g s a re 

 served on the side. 
Also there is a choice of vegetables. We had broc­ coli w ith hollan d aise sauce but w ere "disap­ pointed that it was over cooked and had lost its bright green color. The sauce is very rich, so some diners will prefer to order it on the side. 
Desserts 

The desserts also are very rich. I had a French lemon pie (75 cents) from the pastry' cart. Tarts and cheesecake also are avai­ lable. 

The luncheon m enu offers entrees for about half the price of dinners. 
A bernathy say s the most popular lunches are 
Chicken 
Divan and 
Shrimp Casserole, but I would be interested in trying the quiche. 
S tartin g next w eek, 
Abernathy plans to offer a luncheon special with lighter dishes such as cold avocado soup and gazpacho. 
R eg u larly , luncheon soups might be French 

 cheese or cream of spin­ ach. 
Lunch is served from 11 a m. to 2:3o p m. Monday through Friday. Dinner is served from 6 to ll p.m . M onday through 
Thursday and from 6 to 
11:3o Friday and S atur­ day. 
The bar is open all day. 

Antonio T. Valdez Jr., executive chef of the St. 
Anthony Hotel, insisted on working up to the last minute until his retire­ ment began with a cele­ bration at 4 p.m. Friday. 
And th a t included supervising the regular heavy luncheon business. 
The hotel sta ff honored 
“ Chef Tony” with a reception in the Cavalier Room of the hotel, but he was in charge of the kitchen until five of 4! 
A feasl 
Even so, his kitchen helpers managed to prepare a feast of fancy hors d ’ oeuvres, stand­ ing round of beef, fresh shrimp, stuffed jalapenos and stuffed salm on rolls served with cocktails. 
The party was complete with flowers, an ice carving and music by Joe Morin. 
Chef Valdez began his hotel 

 food service career in the St. 
Anthony at age 17, w orking first as a glass w asher and runner and later as a pantry helper. 
Between 1927 and 1966, he served as head pantry m an, fry cook, second cook, night chef and sous chef. 
He has been executive chef since 1966 and is one of the few executive chefs of a nationally noted hotel who has received his entire training and exper­ ience in the United States, ex­ cept for military service. 
D uring his c a re e r, Chef 
Valdez has supervised prepar- ation of m eals for m any notables visiting San Antonio, including P resid en ts of the 
United States and Mexico, go­ vernors, federal and state dig­ nitaries. 
He also is rem em bered for fine deb u tan te p a rtie s and wedding receptions. 

He took special p ride in p re p a rin g m eals for c e le ­ brities, in planning banquets 

 for as many as 1,4oo and in feeding convention groups which re tu rn e d y e a r a fte r year. 
His sp e c ia ltie s include 
Stuffed Red Snapper with 
Crabmeat, Veal Scaloppine, 
Steak Diane and Filet of Beef an Strasbourg. 
Preparation 

Af the St. Anthony, Chef 
Valdez was in charge of all biod preparation for the hotel as well as for the St. Anthony 
Club and the Charles V. 
A native of Nava, Coahuila, 
Mexico, Chef Valdez considers 
San Antonin home. He has long been un American citizen and is an avid fan of A m erica’s favorite sport—baseball. 
He is a charter member of the Texas Chefs Association. 
R eplacing Chef Valdez is 
Huns J. Ladwein, a native of 
Berlin, G erm any, who left a position as executive chef at the Royal Sonesta, New O r­ leans, to come to San Antonio.

House cat doesnt dig litter 

Dear Ann Landers: 
I have a house eat that. I firmly believe is unna­ tural in the species. She simply will not perform the uet of “ digging and covering.” 
Every time she goes to the box, I have to go with her and assist in the ri­ tual or take her outdoors. 
I was discussing this with a friend recently and he insists this is not uncommon. 
He claims- not all cats, even members of the large cat families, follow this pat­ tern. 
We have a $5 bet on this but can’t find anyone whose word we will both take. I told him I’d take 
Ann Landers’ word and asked him if he would. 
He .said, “ Yes, but ITI bet you another $5 you don’t have the nerve to write to her.” 
So here it is. Who wins? — Old Topper In 
Klamath Falls 
Dear Top: 
It s a stand-off. You win $5 for 

"having the nerve” but your friend is right about the cat. 
It is not all that “ Un­ natural.” I checked with 
Gloria Shelton, President of the Animal Protective 
Association of Chicago, and was told that your cat may have been paper-trained too soon. 
Or perhaps she doesn’t like the brand of kitty litter (some are synthetic and the cat might not dig it — if you’ll pardon the pun). 
“ But,” added Shelton, 
‘‘the woman should be glad her cat uses the box at all. Some don’t”

 love is 

...leaving the vacuuming till after the baseball. 

Dear Ann Landers: My boyfriend asked me to write this letter because he wants to know if so­ meone besides me thinks he is crazy. 
It’s Tom’s car. He treats it like a person — or as if it were the Hope 
Diamond on wheels. 
When he first bought it he laid down the rules: Don’t put your fingers on the glass when shutting the door. 
No crossed legs, both feet on the floor mat. No smoking, eating or drinking in the chariot. 
He washes it every day and waxes it every week. 
W’hen we go out he parks as far away from other cars as possible to avoid nicks on the doors. 
This means we often walk several extra blocks, no matter what the weather. 
Other than being hung-up about his car. 
Tom is a great guy and very normal. Will he out­ grow this love affair with 
“ Wheels” or am I stuck forever? — No. 2 

Dear 2: 
You’d better learn to live with it, dear. 
Most guys who are car- crazy stay that way. 

One suggestion: If he insists on parking a con­ siderable distance from 
“ the place’’ to avoid nicks on the car doors, 

 r Ann 

(Landers 

.ll ■■ ll. ........IMI.. 

 ask him to drop you off and pick you up. 

You’ll feel less imposed on — even though the ex­ ercise would be good for you. 
Birthmark 

Dear Ann: Our son was born with a purple birth mark on his neck. The mark is the size of a dime 

My mother’s aunt who came here from another country insists the birthmark is a punish­ ment because my wife stole some plums from a market when she was a child. We know this Is nuts but please comment. 
- R. And L. 

Dear R. and L.; You’ve already said it's nuts and 
I can’t improve on your evaluation. 

See a dermatologist about now techniques for removing port wine stains. This sounds like it might be one. 
Chemistry 

Don’t flunk your chemistry test. Love is more than one set of glands calling to another. lf you have trouble mak­ ing a distinction you need 
Ann's booklet, “ Love or 
Sex and How to Tell the 

Difference.”

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) 
— Federal au th o rities said Friday they broke up a plot by H aitian rebels and A m erican sym pathizers to buy arms in the United States to equip a 1oo-man ex­ peditionary force plan­ ning to overthrow the 
Haitian government. 
The charges were made in a complaint filed in federal court here against six men, includ­ ing Rene J. Leon, of New 
York, chief of staff of the 
Haitian armed forces in 
1961. All six were arrest­ ed Thursday by federal agents on ch arg es of conspiracy to purchase and transport firearms. 
A complaint filed with 
U.S. Magistrate Serena 
Perretti said the six con­ spired to buy a relatively sm all cache of arm s, take them to Haiti and use them in bank rob­ beries.

After gunfire from the house subsided, Hester and another officer en­ tered the home, wrestled 
Cruz to the floor and handcuffed him, Hester said. 
A woman was also found in the house, of­ ficers testified. 
Officers testified they repeatedly identified themselves as police of­ ficers when try in g to enter the house and avoid injury from the gunfire. 
Defense attorneys are expected to open their argument Monday.

WASHINGTON 
- 
Fourteen form er 
Washington Post press­ men were given sen ­ tences Friday ranging from $25o fines to one year in prison stemming from incidents during a p re ssm e n ’s strike against the newspaper that began in 1975. 
District of Columbia 
Super Court Judge Sylvia 
Bacon imposed the sen­ tences, saying the exis- 

The last words a police officer ut­ tered before he was shot to death were heard by a 224th District Court jury 
Friday. 
The capital murder trial of Johnny 
Joe Garza — accused in the 1973 shooting of Patrolman Russell Span- nagel — moved into its second day with prosecution witnesses describing the death scene. 
The jury heard Spannagel’s last words when prosecutors played the tape of police radio transmission re­ cords for the night of June 3o, 1973 just prior to and including the time he was shot. 
Testimony is to resume Monday at 
1o:3o a.m. before Judge Al Klein and a jury of six men and six women. 
The current trial is the state’s se­ cond try at gaming a guilty verdict against Garza. 
At the time of his death, Spannagel was 24, had two children and had been on the force about four years. 
A deadlocked jury in November, 1974 led to a mistrial ruling in the state’s 

 earlier case against Garza. 
Garza is married and has nine chil­ dren. He has been free on $1oo,ooo bond since 1973. 
Seven witnesses so far have testified to the events at the scene. From their accounts, Spannagel was allegedly killed by a bullet from his own gun during a scuffle with Garza at the su­ spect’s home, 523 Tidewind Drive. 
Spannagel apparently went lo that address to arrest Garza in connection with a stabbing reported to police ear­ lier in the evening, witnesses indicat­ ed. 
Asst. Dist. Atty. Charles Conaway is handling the prosecution as he did in 
1974. Garza’s defense is being handled by A. L. Hernden with Charles Cam­ pion. 
Jury selection took more than a week and testimony formally opened Thurs­ day. The trial is expected to continue through next week. 
A conviction on a captital m urder charge carries a penalty of life imp­ risonment or death. 

The clerk, producing a broomstick handle, or­ dered the man to drop the rock. The would-be bandit complied and was arrested by SAPD Task 
Force officers who a r­ rived soon after being sum m onded by te le ­ phone.

EDOUARD SEIDLER, autographs copies of “ Let’s Call It Fies­ ta ,” the book th a t traces one o f the most extensive new car developm ent program s in au to m o tive history 

AU TO M O TIV E plS P L A Y~ 
■AUTOMOTIVE DISPLAY 

Gunn has opened a Datsun dealership at 75o IH41o at the Broadway exit. The staff of Gunn Datsun in­ cludes Bruce M cGee, business manager, left; Charles 
Bobbish, sales manager; Charles Casper, vice presi­ 

 dent and general m anager; Craig P e arce, parts manager, and G a ry Powell, service m anager. The facility's service shop is completed and the showroom soon will be completed. 

We Americans tend to believe we invented the love affair with the automobile. 
Perhaps we did. but we do not own the exclusive rights to love affairs. It is so­ mething of a shock to learn our European cousins may be more deeply in love with cars than we are. 
That possibility was brought home rather forcefully to me last year by 
Walter Hayes, vice chairman. Ford of 
Europe, when he gave me a copy of a paperback book titled, “ Let’s Call It 
Fiesta.” 
The cover announces the book is “ The 
Autobiography of Ford s Project Bob­ cat.” 
Project Bobcat was the code name for the car that was eventually called Fiesta. 
The book was written by Edouard Siedler a noted European auto editor and writer. 
Selling well 
I really thought the book was a company publication put out to promote the car. So i was really put-down when Walter ex­ plained that while not a best seller, it was selling well in the book stores. 
“ Why,” I asked, “ would people buy a book about a company building a new car?” 
“ Well, you see,” he said, with a twinkle that comes so easily to his eyes, “ I rather think it’s because we Europeans love our cars even more than you Americans do!” 
Fascinating story 
Without conceding the point, the book tells a fascinating inside story of a billion dollar gamble by one of the world’s mul­ ti-national companies — the only such firm bearing the name of the man who still leads it. 
Now the book — and the car — will soon be introduced to America.

Auto down-sizing writes end to Y-8 

WASHINGTON POST SERVICE 

DETROIT - The end is in sight for the venerable V-8 engine, 
75-plus years old and a high-vo­ lume centerpiece of the auto in­ dustry for more than half a cen­ tury. 
General Motors Corp. has told the Na­ tional Highway Traffic Safety Adminis­ tration (NHTSA) the V-8 will most likely to be dropped in about five years as the primary power plant for family ears. 
Today just under 7o per cent of all 
American-made cars are being built with 
V-8 engines. About 2o per cent have six- cylinder engines and the remainder have four-cylinder power plants. 
Meet federal law 
GM ’s reason for the V-8’s demise is to be able to meet the federal law' now on the books requiring vast improvements in the miles per gallon for all new cars sold through 1985 and after. 
Oddly, the GM document was written before President Carter announced his tax-and-rebate program for new ears based on their fuel economy. His program 

 could only serve lo accelerate the changes envisioned in G M ’s statement to NHTSA. 
The auto maker’s document detailing the drastic alterations likely in coming 
U.S. ears was drawn up in response to an 
NttTSA query about how GM planned to meet the required fleet average boost in furl economy. 
Iii it. GM made these points: 
• No 1984 model GM car would have a 
V-8..and only the 1983 Corvette would have one. 
P The 3.8 litre, roughly 23o cubic inch, 
V K would he the largest engine sold iii 
1984 models. 
GM’s just-downsized, hugely successful 
1977 model big cars would again be cut in size for the 1983 model year. After that they would weigh roughly 3,2oo pounds — or approximately what the present com­ pact Chevrolet Nova weighs. 
• Meeting the 1985 mileage require­ ment would enormously degrade acceler­ ation and performance. None of the 1985 cars would go from a standing start to HO miles per hour in less than 15 seconds, and most would average about 18 or 19 seconds. 
• While the drastic scenario so care­ fully delineated would meet the mileage

AUTOMOTOR DISPLAY 

 required by law. there is no guarantee the consumer will buy the products, GM said, 
• Better radial tires should increase mileage for four-fifths of the 1985 ears by 
4 per cent. 
The General Motors submission is hea­ vily spotted with blanks: 
• Things GM insists NHTSA treat with confidentiality. The document is not one 
GM is offering freely or widely in this city but is available to the public at the go­ vernment’s Freedom of Information li­ brary in Washington. 
In addition to the things GM sees in its crystal ball, the auto maker for the first time has specified the* precise cost of downsizing its 1977 large cars. 
“ The downsizing applicable on 1977 (GM ) re­ gular and luxury cars was about as mo­ dest a program as possible, yet it cost about $1 I billion 
“ As we go forward, downsizing may required the use of front-wheel drive components, all-new engines, uli-new transmissions, etc. 
“ The cost of such programs will be substantially higher than our 1977 pro­ gram. which was largely able to utilize many carryover mechanical compon­ ents," G M ’s staffers wrote.

AUTO TALK 

Continued from Page I 

 land, N J., has just published Seidler’s book, and on May 23, Fiesta will be shown to the national press in California. 
The paperback book will carry a $4.95 price tag, a rather high price as paper­ backs go in this country, but money well spent by the car buff. 
I have not had the pleasure of meeting 
Seidler, but I have read his “ The Ro­ mance of Renault,” a coffeetable tome dealing with the history of the French car builder. 

Other works 

Seidler has also written “ World Cham­ pion.” the story of Jackie Stewart and 
Matra, and “ The Great Voices of the Au­ tomobile,” a series of interviews with leaders of the industry, which I have not read. What makes “ Let’s Call It Fiesta” unusual reading is the complete access 
Seidler had to the interworkings of the decision making process at every level 
Henry Ford II cave his approval to the writing of the book, thus assuring that 
'Seidler was allowed to talk to anyone and everyone involved. 
Seidler quotes freely from conversations that occurred in otherwise 

 secret meetings, reveals how marketing research was done to test styling exer­ cises, lets you see how the personality of 
Fiesta evolved from the men who built it. 

Dramatic decision 

After Seidler takes your through all of the agony of building the car, he leaves almost lo the very end one of the most dramatic decisions ever made — the se­ lection of the name. 
Many of the people involved with Pro­ ject Bobcat had become so attached to the name they wanted to keep it. But, of course, that was impossible since Mer­ cury already sold a Bobcat in this country. 
A long list of possible names was nar­ rowed to a short list from which a final selection would be made. Some of the names on the final list were Amigo, Bebe, 
Bravo, Cherie, Chico, Metro, Pony and 
Fiesta. 

Doubts erased 
One of the most interesting chapters in the book is how the final selection was made. For that bit you’ll have to read the book — that chapter alone is almost worth the price. 

If Ford management ever had any doubts about the success of their new baby, those doubts were erased when the rar_debuted in Europe. 

The motoring press was enthusiastic. 

More important, the people liked it too. 
Initial sales indicated wide acceptance. 

I observed an expression of the Euro­ pean love of cars first hand during a test drive of the Fiesta in England last year. 
We had stopped for lunch at a small pub nestled near the Thames river. 

The car had not been introduced in 
Lngland at that time, and when we were ready to leave, a small group of men and women were admiring it. 

Is that the new Fiesta?” one rather distinguished lady asked. We assured her it was. “ Its darling; I simply must have one. 

I seldom observe that type of reaction in this country. 

Walter Hayes may be right; the Euro­ peans may have a bigger love affair with cars than we do. 

But I don’t really believe it. 

AUTOMOUV* DISPLAY 

Time-conscious drivers are offered a new digital clock-radio as an option on I 977 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights and Toror.ados. The AM- 
FM radio shows the station frequency each time the set is turned on or the station changed. The time is displayed in the digital numbers the remainder of the trip. In addition, three buttons can be activated to ( I) show the date or (2) reveal the elapsed running time of a trip or (3) reset the elapsed running time. 

Y W Rabbit eyed as taxi of future 

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) - Checker 
Motor Corp. took a diesel-powered Volks­ wagen Rabbit, loaded it with SOO pounds of sand, and followed a taxicab around 
Chicago for a day recently. 
The Rabbit got 45 miles to the gallon, and SO miles to the gallon the following day when it was driven back to Checker headquarters in Kalamazuo. 
The experiment convinced Checker the taxi of the future will be a Rabbit, ac­ cording to company President David 
Markin. 
He told stockholders at the firm’s an­ nual meeting the Rabbit taxi will be modified to have more interior room than the company’s 2o-year-old Checker cab. 
The present model, produced at a rate of about 7o a week. “ guzzles gas, is heavy and expensive to produce,” Markin said. 

He said Edward Cole, the former Gen­ eral Motors Corp. president who was killed in a plane crash May 2, made important contributions to the new cab in the two months he was chief executive of 
Cheeker. 

Checker has been only marginally pro­ fitable in recent years. 

Markin said no decisions had been made on whether Cheeker would continue to manufacture its current cab nitwit*! or if it were to go ahead with tilt* Rabbit pro­ ject.
