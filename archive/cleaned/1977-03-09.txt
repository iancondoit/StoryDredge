Califano to slice away

A SSO C IA T E D PRESS 
WASHINGTON - The House on Tuesday approved a tax cut package that would give 2oo million Americans a rebate of up to $5o this spring as well as increasing the take home pay of some 45 million couples or indi­ viduals. The vote was 282 to 131. 
Final passage came after the House rejected four R epublican am e n d ­ ments, including one to substitute an across-the-board permanent tax cut for

 the $511 rebates. That am end m en t failed by only 25 votes. 
The tax cut is part of a $32-billion, two-year program designed to in­ crease consumer spending and prime the economy in an effort to put unem­ ployed Americans back to work With some of the tax cut provisions being made permanent, taxpayers would save $43 I billion over the next 31 months, through fiscal 1979. 
Other parts of the program would i

- 
H ealth, 
Education and Welfare Secre­ tary .Joseph A. Califano dr. 
Tuesday announced a m ajo r reorganization of health care, social service, student ait! and income assistance program s he says will save taxpayers at least 
$2 billion a year by 1881. 
The p rogram s involve about one third of Culifano’s $145 billion budget. 
Calling the restructuring the most fa r-rea ch in g in the d e p a r tm e n t’s 
24-year history, Califano said the ini- tiatives “ will simplify and streamline 
HEW operations and help make jtossi- ble effective program management, sound financial control and coherent delivery of social services." 
Not precise 

"Although it is not possible at this time to give a precise estim ate," Cali­ fano said, “ the saving for the l T S. taxpayer related to these reorganiza­ tion initiatives, especially those involv­ ing efforts to eradicate errors, fraud and abuse,^will be at least $1 billion over the next two years aud will reach a total of at least $2 billion annually bv 
1981." 
He a ls o predicted it would make bis department more responsive to the people 
In taking the rapid action — only six weeks after mov ing into office — Cali­ fano said he was fulfilling President 
C arter’s directive to the Cabinet to honor a campaign promise of simpli­ fying the over-complicated federal go­ vernment structure 
No legislation 
The reorganization, which will catch most of the agency employes, special interest groups and congressional overseers by surprise, is administra­ tive and docs not require legislative action since it does not alter the sub­ stance of H E W ’s p ro g ra m s, said 
< Milano. 
These changes — t reating one new organization.* reshuffling other pro­ grams and abolishing one major di­ vision — include the follow mg: 
• Establishment of a new operating division, the Health (a r e Financing 
Administration lilt* reborn bus I teen extensively discussed in Congress and has the support of key Senate leaders such as 
Finance Committee Chairman Russell 
Long, D-La 
It would for the first time put Medi­ 

 care aid to the elderly, Medicaid as­ sistance to tin' poor and quality control of these programs under one adminis­ trator reporting directly to the HEW seerelar.v. 
Such a consolidated approach was supported last week in a report by the 
National Governors Conference. 
Medicare now falls under the Social 
Security A dm inistration. Medicaid under the Social and Rehabilitation 
Service and quality control under the 
Public Health Service. 
The new structure would combine all financing, but would leave overall health care planning under the juris­ diction of the assistant secretary for health. 

• 
Placement of all cash assistance programs under the Social Security 
Administration, so that there will be only one major HEW division respon­ sible for all d irect 
“ incom e maintenance" programs. 
This would transfer the Aid to F a ­ milies with Dependent Children pro­ gram — providing payments to single parent families — from the Social and 
Rehabilitation Service to the Social 
Security Administration, which will a lso continue to run its separate pay­ ment programs for the aged and disa­ bled, 
• Consolidation of all student finan­ cial aid programs into a new Bureau of 

Sec C ALIFANO. Page TA 

 increase spending tor public works, job training and public service jobs. 
.The package also includes a business tax break that President Carter tried at the last minute to stop The House passed the business tax provision bv 
341 to 74. * 
Rep Al Ullman, D-Ore , chairman of the House Ways and Means Commit­ tee. called the tax cut package a rea­ sonable and balanced effort to stimulate the economy. 
His Republican counterpart on the committee, Barber Conable of New 
York, assailed the legislation as a flawed bill “ with scan t ch a n ce of achieving its purported aim s.” 
Biggest fight 
The biggest fight cam e over the rebates, which Republicans called wasteful. The House by a 312-1o3 vote accepted the amendment written by the Ways and Means Committee that would deny the rebates to those earn­ ing more than $3o,ooo a year, reduce the rebate to under $5o for those in the 
$25,ooo to $3o,ooo range and ensure that welfare recipients share in the pro­ gram. Carter had recommended the rebates to everyone, no matter what their income. 
The rebate ban would apply to those couples who file a joint return and whose com bined'adjusted gross in­ come is more than $3o,ooo, as well as to single taxpayers whose income exceeds $3o,ooo 
Tile key vote on the rebate question, however, cam e on a G O P attempt to substitute a permanent tax reduction. 

The proposal, which would have meant an extra $185 a year tax saving for a family of four earning $15,ooo, was as­ sailed by Democrats who said it would do nothing to stimulate the economy 
The GOF* measure failed 219 to ,194. 
As the House considered the tax package, its appropriations committee was approving a $23 billion money m easure to fund key p a rts of the package The bill is set for a House vote on Friday. 
The money bill provides more money than Carter wanter! in two areas but generally follows the P r e s i d e n t ’* recommendations. It would provide $4 billion for public works this year, in­ stead of the $4 billion spread over twc years requested by the President. It also provides $632.5 million in aid tr states and local governments in area* 
(»f high unemployment instead of the 
$25o million requested by the adminis­ tration

Gonzalez had submitted his resigna­ tion last week in a dispute with other committee members over the proposed firing of Chief Counsel 
Richard 
Sprague. 
No support 
Tuesday on the Allen Dale Show on 
VVOAI radio, Gonzalez said he was forced to resign because the leadership would not support him 
"There was not much I could do. I was not going to act like a stooge like the rest of them ,” the congressman said 
Gonzalez called fellow Texan and majority leader, Wright, “ oily,” by noting "one reason for the oil shortage is that half of it is in his system.” 
Of the speaker. Gonzalez charged 
O’Neill was “ an old-tim e political 

I r f s s . ” 
Commenting on both of them, Gon­ zalez said. “ Even if they were horn again, I wouldn’t touch them with a 
15-fool pole because they sold me down the river ” 
Gonzalez said he was "sandbagged” as ch airm an, saying O ’Neill was a close friend of the Kennedy family and never wanted the probe into the assas­ sination ol President John F. Kennedy reopened. 
Wright represents the Dallas-Fort 
Worth business interests which also did not want tin* investigation into 
President Kennedy’s slaying revived, he said 

" I ve been sandbagged to appear as that damn Mexican who if he ca n ’t pitch won’t play ball" 
Gonzalez charged. 
Washington sources privately said they saw Stokes’ appointment as a sign of hope only for the investigation of the murder of civil rights leader Martin 
Luther King .lr 
Stokes, a Cleveland Democrat, is one of the four members of the Congres­ sional B lack Caucus who were ap ­ pointed to the 12-member committee last September as a result of the cau­ cus’ special interest in the King as­ sassination 
Stokes, however, said he thinks it is 
’absolutely essential that the original intent of the com m ittee be carried forth” to investigate the assassinations of both President Kennedy and King 
The new chairm an said the com ­ mittee may release some sort of preli­ minary report on the evidence gath­ erer! thus far “without in any way jeo­ pardizing the persons involved in such investigative leads" iii hopes of gener­ ating sufficient support.

Precious papers damaged on

Before the train hit the rails, the 
Smithsonian Institution provided strict instructions on the care and keeping of historical docum ents. For example, the te m p e ra tu re was supposed to be kept around 7o degrees, the humidity level at 5o per cent.

Instead, H ughes im pulsively put a plane at the disposal of P atty ’s father, 
Randolph H earst, on a 24-hour basis.

The re la tio n h sip betw een H ughes and the H e a rs ts is re v e a le d in th e cache of pap ers, which the Mexican au thorities seized at our instigation after the dying billionaire was flown from Acapulco to Houston last year. 
Hughes had always adm ired William

It is likely that the late pu b lish er m ay have in spired som e of H u g h es’ early dash.

H e a rst finally heard from H ughes the sa m e day he was forced to close down the*paper. Recalling it all a de­ cade later, H earst said that H ughes probably would have kept on dawdling. 
“ I liked h im ," said H earst, “ but he was light as a sausage skin.” 
Again in 1974, the H earsts appealed to H ughes for part of the $4 million ransom for Patty Hearst. 
The recluses’s attorney, Chester Du- vis, reported that he and aide William 
Gay “ both feel very strongly that it would he highly inadvisable for you to become involved." 
Hughes, therefore, rejected the^re- quest. but left open the option "if atelic last m in u te it a p p e a r s th a t (th e

Horse racing hopes are off and running 

SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS— Wednesday March 9 1977 
H 

 in 

B y DICK M E R K E L 

CHIEF, EXPRESS CAPITOL BUREAU 

AUSTIN — The first heat another run at legalizing horse race betting on a local option basis in Texas was off and run­ ning here Tuesday. 

^ And. the Express learned, the Bexar 
County delegation is almost unani­ mously committed to spurring it on to victory. 
HB1499 — “ The Texas Horse Racing 
Act" — was introduced in the House on first reading Tuesday morning. 
It is co-sponsored by Reps. Matt 
Garcia of San Antonio, Billy Hall of 
Laredo, and Craig Washington of 
Houston. 
HB1499 is expected to be in the hands 

 of the House Intergovernmental A f­ fairs Committee by Wednesday. 
Last time 

The last time Texas legalized horse race betting was in 193:1 when it passed the legislature as part of the agricul­ tural appropriations bills. 
It was outlawed four years later by the 1937 legislature. 
Because both the legalization and repeal resulted from legislative action, some proponents of the bill do not feel a statewide referendum is necessary now. 
Others, however, feel such an elec­ tion is the best way to permanently establish horse race betting in Texas. 
For this reason, a House resolution calling for a referendum is expected to be introduced within the next few days. 
In 1974, horse race betting was 

 placed on the ballot by petition and narrow ly was defeated statewide 
635,ooo to 58o.ooo. 
It won in Bexar County by a wide margin, with voters in only one pre­ cinct voting against it, 
List of rules 

HB1499 calls for establishment of a state Racing Commission and sets a long list of rules aud regulations for state control of both horse racing and pari-mutuel betting. 
It also calls for local option elections by which voters in each area of the state may decide whether they want horse racing and betting. 
Yet to be determined is where the anticipated revenues from horse race wagering would go. 
Many observers feel that unless some or all of the funds are earmarked

 for public eduction, HU 1499 will not pass. 
This is also a key issue with the 
Bexar County legislative delegation, which reacted to HB1499 in this fa­ shion: 
• Rep. Roil Bird: “ I was a strong supporter of it during the Constitu­ tional Convention. I guess I could sup­ port it again this time.” 
• Rep. Al Brown: “ The people in my district voted strongly for it in the last referendum (1974). I think it would be good for Texas and keep the money at home.” 
“ Browu s reference to money is in keeping with proponents contentions that millions of dollars leave Texas annually to be spent at race tracks in 
Louisiana. Arkansas and New Mexico.) 
• Rep. Don Cartwright favors it as long as the final approval is left to voters statewide. “ Anytime I can help to allow voters to decide, that’s the fairest way. Since this will be a refer­ endum to establish horse race betting constitutionally I ’m for letting the people decide. Last time the people in my district voted 7(1 per cent in favor bf it.” 
• 
Rep. Matt Garcia: “ Obviously. 
I’m a co-sponsor of the bill.” 
• Rep. Joe I,. Hernandez: “ I'm all for it. I ve always supported it. I have seen what it has done for the economic development of other areas particu­ larly in Mexico. I think it’s grout " 
• Rep. Frank Madia: ‘T m for it and cutting ad valorem taxes with the proceeds for the people back home.’’ 
• Rep. Don Rains: “ Yes, I ’m going to vote for it, but with some reserva­ tions. I think people are going to lie terribly disappointed in the amount of money it will generate'to the state. It won t be any big windfall ... in fact I 'd be surprised if it generated more than 
$29 million annually.” 
• Rep. Abe Ribak: “ Certainly I ’m for it. I eo-sponosored similar legisla­ tion before I would like to see the money put into public education." 
• Rep. Lou Nolle Sutton: “ I have no opinion one way or the other at this time.” 
• 
Rep. Frank Tejeda: “ My only question is where will the money go. ll it’s for public education, then i'm for it." . 
• 
Rep. Bob Yale: “ I have always supported it iii the past and see no reason not to this time.” 
• Sen. Glenn Kothmunn — “ One word — for.” 
• Sen. Frank Lombardino — “ I ’m 7o per cent for and 3o per cent against. 
That's how my constituents voted lust time. So, I’m for it on a local option basis.” 
• Sen. John Traeger: “ I'm definitely for it. Every county in my district vot­ ed for it during the last referendum, lf pari-mutuel betting is allowed it should be approved on a local option basis." 
Veteran legislative observers are guardedly optimistic over the b ill’s chances iii this session 
House Speaker Bill Clayton has been quoted as saying he thinks the bill has a fair chance et passing this session. 
“ I have heard members say they might support it who have never sup­ ported ii iii the past. It will probably get a good run,” he was quoted as saving bv the Associated Press. 
Ender HB1499, off-track betting would be prohibited.

A series of ironies linked the lives of three construction workers killed in a Brackenridge 
Park euve-in Tuesday. 

Stunned relatives pieced together the sparse details of the lives of Baul Gonzalez Medina. 
36, Theophoie Hernandez 
( Yuz. 3o, and Constantino 
Lopez, 3o, who died iii a construction cave in ut the park. 
The most bitter irony, to Gonzalez’ brother, Ig­ nacio, is that all three 

 men quit other jobs to licgin work at the park 
Thursday. 
The three men had re­ cently moved into a house trailer near Igna­ cio Gonzalez* home at 227 
Briggs St. 
“ The oilier two moved in with Rani so they could save money and bring their families here from Mexico." Gonzalez said. “ Now there is ,no reason."

Gonzalez came to San 
Antonio about two years ago from his native town of Anahuac in Nuevo 
Leon, Mexico. Lopez, al­ so from Anahuac, came to Texas about a year ago. 
Neighbors hold an uno­ pened letter from Cruz’ wife, Concepcion, who lives in Ciudad Victoria 
None of the mens* wives know about their deaths. Gonzalez said he would go get his brother’s wife, Yolanda. 
Wednesday, 
“ I don’t know what lo say to her or Raul’s two little girls. 
Yolanda is expecting their third baby any day now,” he said. 
Lopez’ sister, Filed!na 
Lafuente, of 1447 Edrts 
St., said her brother’s wife still does not know, 
“They have five children and Elid a, his wife, is four months pregnant,” she said 
Work 
Neighbors and re la ­ tives said the three men had worked together at various construction jobs in San Antonio 
The ironies connecting their lives merged with ft

The victims were identified as Con­ stantino Lopez, 3o, Raul Gonzalez Me­ dina. 36. and Theophoie ll. Cruz. 56. all of 225 Briggs SI. 
According to witnesses. the accident occurred about 9 am . while a con­ struction crew was clearing dirt near a sewage pipe iii a 1o-foot-deep ditch. 
The ditch is part of a drainage project through that section of the park. 
The company has been contracted by the City of San Antonio to work on a drainage and sewage project at Avenue 
Ii and Mill Race Road in Brackenridge 
Bark, said Sam Grunata, public works director. 
Firem en 
Construction workers aided firemen and Emergency Medical Service tech­ nicians iii attempting to rescue the buried men 
The men were pronounced dead at the Green Hospital. Medical Examiner 
Dr. Huben Santos ruled the deaths ac­ cidental asphyxiation by suffocation. 
Hist. Fire Chief Ralph Medina said digging was interrupted after the body of the first victim was recovered be­ cause the walls of the ditch threatened to collapse again. 
The rescue effort was resumed after plywood sections were hurriedly braced against the dirt walls with boards. 
Santos said Torres also suffocated in 
Monday’s accident when a ditch col­ lapsed and he was buried al a con­ struction site in the 133oo block of Na­ cogdoches Road

Local park a 
'powder k e g ’; red lights 

Roddy 
Stinson com m on 

"Sun Antonio has a powder keg as potentially explosive as White Hock Lake Park in 
Dallas,” says a caller to this column. 
“ It ’s called 
McAllister Park.” 
White Rock Lake Park in Big I) 
Was the site of a near-riot Sunday afternoon. 
More than IOO policemen battled a crowd of young toughs who threw bottles and rocks at the lawmen after an officer tried to make an arrest in the park. 
Eight people — including six po­ licemen — were injured, and 42 persons were arrested. 
“ But that was a picnic compared to what could happen at M cAllis­ ter.’’ said the caller. “ I took my wife and two children out there 
Sunday afternoon for a Dike* ride, and I was shocked. 
“ It’s a no-man’s land.” 
Rough croud 
Specifically, the North San An­ tonio man said the area was crammed with “ what I'd call a real rough rock festival crowd. 
“ About IO per cont of the people were ‘straight’ families, and the rest were groups of young people drinking beer, smoking marijuana, racing motorcycles and cars and playing loud rock music. 
“ The traffic was bumper to bumper — vans, motorcycles, pick­ ups — and when a d river saw somebody he wanted to talk to. he just stopped in the middle of the road and made everyone behind him wait. 
“ One lonely park ranger was tile only sign of law and authority in sight, and he stayed in his car. 
“ I don’t blame him. lf a cop tried to make any kind of arrest, some­ body would get hurt for sure. The people out there are just looking for trouble. 
Scary 
“ It’s sad in a way. The kids have to go somewhere. But they’ve made the park so scary that the people who pay for it can't use it. 
“ I wouldn’t go back there for an­ ything.” 
In re s p o n se (o that complaint, 
Hon Darner, director of the city’s 
B a r k s and Recreation Dept., was rather tight-lipped Tuesday. 
“ We've had numerous complaints about the situation.” he admitted, 
"but all I can say is we’re working on solutions to the problem with various law enforcement agencies. 

“ There will definitely be heavier patrolling of the area in the future. 
Darner said part of the problem was the nice weather. 
“ People have been cooped in so long by the rain and cold that the sunshine has brought them out in droves. So all our parks are over­ crowded.’’ 
But overcrowding is one thing — and unruliness is another. 
Only the presence of law officers is going to make the hooligans be­ have and create an atm osphere where taxpayers and their families can enjoy the park they paid for. 
Hopefully Darner and his rangers haven’t allowed the situation to be­ come so explosive that attempts to solve the problem will ignite the powder keg. 
Missing woman 
Last week an item appeared here about a missing South Texas wo­ man, Diana Kaiser, who was last seen Jan 6 near Wharton 
The column mentioned that per­ sons who last saw the a 21-year-old woman said that she had been forced off the highway by an un­ marked car bearing red lights and several antennas. 
Readers were encouraged to con­ tact law enforcement officers in 
Wharton if they spotted such a car. 
The suggestion was grossly naive. 
Judging from the phone calls this column has received about un­ marked red-lighted vehicles in the 
San Antonio area, such cars are common. 
Furtherm ore, no one seems to care. 
Red light 
According to San Antonio Police 
Inspector Elroy Crenvvelge, “ State law says: “No person shall drive or move any vehicle (other than an emergency vehicle) on any highway with any lamp or device displaying a red light visible from the front....’ 
“ But the courts have ruled that a light isn t a light if it s not turned on. So we don’t stop anyone unless the red lights are burning.’ 
A Department of Public Safety spokesman iii Austin said essen­ tially Hu* same thing. 
Iii other words, any driver i i i the stall' can rig red lights on top of his vehicle and never be questioned by anyone. 
What a perfect setup for hood­ lums. 
It s enough to make you keep driving till whoever’* flashing t lights behind you shoots out yo tues.

IO Soviet-German protesters jailed 

MOSCOW (AP) — Police broke up a demonstration Tuesday on Red Square and arrested IO Soviet citizens of Ger­ man descent seeking the right to em i­ grate from the Soviet Union. 
The banner-waving dem onstrators were members of the Soviet Union’s 
1.8 million m em ber Volga G erm an community that has been in Russia for two centuries. They marched from the onion-domed St. B a sil’s C a th e d ra l toward the Kremlin until stopped by security police who shoved them into a van and drove them away. 

Four W estern newsmen who w it­ 

 nessed the demonstration were also detained by security police. They were driven to a police station near Red 
Square but released shortly afterward. 
The dem onstration, with b anners reading “ Fulfill the Helsinki Accords” and “ Freedom to E m ig rate,” lasted only a few minutes and was believed to be the first on Red Square since 1968, when several Soviet d issidents d is­ played banners condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
Security officers ripped at the signs, but the dem onstrators continued to wave the torn pieces above their heads until they were finally pulled down. 

Proposed law may cut down 'cut-ups* 

 e x p r e s s c a p it o l b u r e a u 
AUSTIN — Attention all you class cut ups! 

The state legislature is being asked to take a hand in disci­ plining you lf all else fails. 

Under a bill filed here Tues­ day, teachers would have the right to remove “ any incorri­ gible publil from their class when he repeatedly interferes with the teacher’s ability to communicate effectively with a majority of the class.” 

HBI487 is by Reps. Al Brown of San Antonio, and Carlyle 
Smith of Arlington. 

The bill is the result of recent hearings and investigations by the House subcom m ittee on 
Educational Goals chaired by 
Brown. 

The hearings, Brown said, 
“revealed discipline is a major problem in the classroom . 
Problems with a few students cause disruption of the entire 

 class. Teachers, in effect, have little means of control over student behavior,” he added. 

Brown feels “ students who want to learn should have the right to. Public school teachers can’t teach and students can’t learn without classroom disci­ pline. 

“This bill will return to the teacher control over the class­ room,” he concluded.

U.S. diplomat gives ’apology’ 

GENEVA, Switzerland 
(A P) — A m erican d i­ plomat Brady Tyson ex­ pressed regrets Tuesday for w hat he said w ere 
U.S. efforts to undermine 
Chile’s late Marxist P re­ sident Salvador Allendc. 
The State D e p a rtm e n t disavowed his rem arks, and Tyson said later he spoke on his own. 
Tyson, a U.S. delegate to the 
U.N. 
H um an 
Rights Commission, was questioned early W ed­ nesday about his remarks in a commission m eeting and said he m ade the s ta te m e n t 
“ under my own responsibility.” 
Chile’s arm ed forces overthrew Allende in a bloody coup in 1973. Al­ lende perished during the battle for the presidential palace and the m ilitary ju n ta issued a re p o rt saying he had committed suicide with his own ri­ fle. 
T yson’s co m m en ts drew an immediate reac­ tion from Washington. 
The State Department declared his statem ent was “ not an expression of administration views.” 
W hite House P re s s 
S ecretary Jody Powell said P re s id e n t C a rte r had no prior knowledge of Tyson’s remarks. 
A ppointee 

Tyson is a C arter a d ­ m inistration appointee and a v eteran of the 
A m erican civil rig h ts movement. 
Tyson had told the U.N. commission, “ We would be less than candid and 
Sears 

 untrue to ourselves and our people if we did not express our profound re­ grets for the role some governm ent officials, agencies and priv ate groups played in the subversion of the previous democratically elected Chilean govern­ ment.” 
State Department spo­ kesm an F re d e ric k Z. 
Brown said 
T yson ’s remarks were “ personal and not approved in advance.” 
Tyson, asked Wednes­ day if he had made the statement on instructions from W ashington, r e ­ plied: 
“ I made it under my own re spo nsibility. I think that what I said was clear. I think it is in the general framework of the Carter foreign policy. 
I hope it is.” 
Surprise 

Ile also expressed sur­ prise at the reaction to his remarks. “ There has been so much publicity and so many investiga­ tions in the 
United 

States,” Tyson said. “ I really didn't think this was such big news.” 
The 
C entral 
In te l­ ligence Agency often has been charged with invol-t vem ent in the A llende' overthrow but there has been no direct evidence’ to support the charge. 
* 
Tyson spoke during a com m ission debate on! the human rights situa­ tion in Chile. The Chilean . military regime has beenj criticized by som e bu-’ man rig h ts group s for- alleged repression. 
Tyson said: 
“ We- recognize fully that the, expression of re g re ts , however profound, c a n ­ not co n trib ute s ig ­ nificantly to easing the suffering and terror that the people of Chile have- experienced in the last, two years. 
“ We can only say that the great majority of the 
American people believe in democracy and justice and freedom and the persons responsible for those acts have been rejected by the people.

SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS— Wednesday March 9 I 977 

District I candidates spar 

; By JAMES MCCRORY 
Roberto 
R odriguez balked into Polunsky’s to buy a fish, and wound up r u n n i n g for the City 
Council. 
* It has not been estab­ lished that there is a dir­ ect connection between 
Ihe two events, but it was 
Jit Polunsky’s Inc. that 
R odriguez first met 
Termer City Councilman 
•Al Beckmann, owner of 
I he concern. 
* B e c k m a n n also is chairman of the Alliance for a Better City, the po­ litical group Councilman 
Henry Cisneros says is responsible for fielding 
Rodriguez against him. 
Rodriguez, 35, a sales d is tr ib u to r and social 

 worker, sees Cisneros' youth as cause of the c o u n c i l m a n ’s “ u n tru e and malicious a c c u s a ­ tions” toward him. 
Seniority 
From the pinnacle of his seniority, Rodriguez said: 
“ Cisneros is a young man and obviously his actions and c o m m e n ts d irected at me a re prompted by panic.” 
Cisneros is 29. 
R odriguez, a d i s ­ charged Mental Health/ 
Mental Retardation e m ­ ploye, rem ain ed in the shadows after his filing on the final day last 
Wednesday, but erupted into the sunlight T u e s­ day.

Standing on the front steps of City Hall, Rodri­ guez expressed surprise that C isneros opposes competition so much he would challenge R odri­ g u e z ’s i n te g r ity and competence. 
He said the council­ man apparently feels no one should run in District 
I for the council except himself. 
“ That is not the demo­ cratic way,” Rodriguez observed. “ We are not living in a Socialist Re­ public.” 
Rodriguez, who lives a block and a half from 
Cisneros, said the coun­ cilm a n has been a p ­ proaching him for weeks 
“ with pleas that I not run.” 
He said Cisneros of­ fered to support him for the post in 1979, when. 
Rodriguez said, Cisneros plans to run for mayor. 
“ When that failed, Cis­ neros offered a final b r i b e , ” R odriguez r e ­ called. 
Claim 
“ He told me if I did not run for office, he would help me, through his in­ fluence with Glen Hart­ man, get my job back at 
Mental Health and Men­ tal Retardation.” 
Hartman is a member of the MH/MR board. 
His meetings with Cis- ineros were always ini­ tiated by the councilman, i Rodriguez claimed.

 to run against the coun­ cilman. 
ABC, Rodriguez said, has offered him nothing, and he hasn t met with any ABC m e m b e r s e x ­ cept the one trip where he met Beckmann at Po­ lunsky’s. 
“ I’m an independent, not a member of any ABC ticket, if there is such a t i c k e t , ” Rodriguez o b ­ served. 
Recalled 
Concerning Cisneros’ criticism of ABC, Rodri­ guez recalled that t w o years ago Cisneros ran on a 
Good 
G o v e rn m e n t 
League ticket. 
ABC’s m e m b e r s h ip includes a n u m b e r of fo rm e r 
G G L ers, a n u m b e r on the 
ABC board. The GGL went out 

 of business shortly before the ABC was formed. 
While Rodriguez’s me­ mory was excellent on some m atters, it failed him on some others. . 

Questioned as * to whether he is under con­ tra c t with The P itluk 
Group, the public r e la ­ tions firm representing c a n d id a te s supposedly backed by ABC (ABC denies any ticket), Ro­ driguez answered “ yes and no." 
He referred questions dealing with the financ­ ing of his campaign to his campaign manager. Ed­ ward P edraza.a cousin 
Pedraza wasn't around to answer the questions. 
Two representatives cf 
The Pitluk Group were on hand for the p re ss conference, as was Mrs. 
Cisneros, the c o u n c il­ man's wife. 

HELEN DETMER 
. . cites water needs 
BOB BILLA 
. jobs, industry 

Mrs. Cisneros had cir­ culated among reporters prior to the Rodriguez press conference with a statement from her hus­ band. 

In that statement, Cis­ neros tried to wrap ABC around 
R o d rig u e z 's neck, and tie a noose. 

Large billboards with 
Rodriguez’s name “ are popping up all over Dis­ trict I,” Cisneros said. 
The councilman said they have been contracted for by The Pitluk Group and are exactly the same as those c o n tra c te d for other ABC candidates in 
Districts 2 and 4. 

He identified those two 
ABC candidates as E u ­ gene 
W illiam s and 
Johnny Mata. (Williams 
S a tu rd a y said b r a v a s running an an indepen­ dent, and is not a m e m b e r of any ABC ticket.) 
The billboards. Cisner­ os said, cost SI,5oo for IO signs. He added that 35 have been o rdered for 
Rodriguez. 

“ That m e a n s R o d r i ­ guez will have been the recipient of about $5,ooo worth of work by Pitluk. not to mention the 5oo yard signs that have been o rdered for h i m , ” Cis­ neros said. 
Cisneros charged Ro­ driguez is in violation of the law in that he has not filed the campaign con­ trib u tio n s r e p o r t s r e ­ quired by law and due last Thursday. 
Rodriguez said he will accept.support from an­ yone, but that his c a m ­ paign is being paid for by him self and friends. 
2 council candidates talk on district needs 

New water mains, drainage and new jobs are needed in Southeast San An­ tonio, two District 3 candidates said 
Tuesday. 
Helen Dutmer, chairman of the 2o1 
Federal Waste Water Commission and a candidate, spoke on water mains and drainage, w hile Councilman Bob Billa, up for re-election, discussed jobs and industry. 
Mrs. Dutmer said existing water mains inside the city must be upgrad­ ed before new extensions are made. 
“ Drainage is a serious problem fac­ 

 ing the people in Southeast San Anton­ io, particularly in the Jupe addition.” she told supporters at 43o3 Golfview 
Drive. 
Meanwhile, Councilman Billa told the East Central High School Beta Club new jobs must be created within the c o m m u n ity so young people can pursue their careers. 
There are opportunities to establish new b usinesses and in du stries in 
Southeast San Antonio, he said. 
As a councilman he has worked toward that end, 
Billa said. 
Jailing traffic fine dodgers questioned 

Mayor Pro Tem Henry 
Cisneros Tuesday ques­ tioned the practice of jailing citizens who can’t pay traffic fines. 
And he p a r tic u la r ly questioned mixing them in the Bexar County Jail with alleged felons. 
C isneros m a d e his comments after making a tour of the jail and talking with some of the prisoners. 
“ T h e r e is one m an there who can’t pay a $37 fine for traffic violations and he is mixed into one of the 24-man c e l l s , ” 
Cisneros said 
He said he will talk with the city m anager and chief of police about the practice of jailing p erso n s for m in o r of­ fenses and about i m ­ proving conditions for 

 them if they have to be jailed. 
The c ity ’s p risoners are handled by the coun­ ty on a contract basis. 
But the city cannot ab­ 

 dicate its moral respon­ sibility, he said. “ We just can’t wash our hands of responsibility because we are contracting with the county.” 
Mata: Funding most important 

Revenue sharing, community development and 
Model City funds are important to District 4. candidate johnny Mata said Tuesday. 
Addressing Lulac Councils 4o3 and 363 and the 
Harlandale Civil Leaders of Education Coalition, 
Mata Holed the district has received $ 19,WM,314 iii funds since 197(1. 
As a councilman, he said, he will work to insure the district continues to get its fair share of funds. 
He said district residents in 1976 got back three times the $1,296,5o3 they paid in taxes 
He said he wants a multi-service center built in the district for the urea youth 
H uebner won’t ask for city tax hike 

City 
Mgr. 
Tom 
Huebner. will recommend to City Council Thursday that the tax rate for the current tiseal year r e ­ main unchanged but that some funds be shifted to make up deficits of about 
$4 million. 
H u e b n c r 's proposals will be made as council considers an ordinance levying property taxes for the c u r r e n t fiscal year, which start til last

Huebner. emphasizing he will not recommend a tax hike, said lie will promise using $2 million in revenue sharing funds; ll million from tho vehi­ cle funds and ll million from the taint! fund

The firm took over th ree vacant b u ild ing s and rem o d eled them to house the new stores.

TAX PLAN 

Continued from Page IA different than the one proposed bv the 
Carter administration although the key element, the $5o-per-person rebates, is basically the same as Carter suggested except for the $3o,ooo ceiling. 
Democrats say the economic pack­ age should add one million lobs and cut the unemployment rate from the current 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent bv year’s end without worsening inflation. 
The rebate proposal has been the controversial section of the package. 
Republicans have been skeptical of the rebate plan since the day it was of­ fered. They contend it is an inefficient, wasteful way to create jobs. especially since the $1o.1 billion needed to pay for the rebates w ill have to be borrow ed by the government. 
Democrats generally viewed the $5o payments as the only feasible way to shift a large amount of money into consumer hands in a short period of time. 

1’he higher standard deduction would be reflected in lower taxes withheld from paychecks, starting 
May I. 

Newspapers show advertising gains 

ASSOCIATED WESS 
NEW YORK — Advertisements in daily newspapers brought in 16.8 per cent more revenue in January than in* the sam e month a year ago, the 
Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. reported Tuesday. 
Classified ads registered the biggest gain, up 24.5 per cent for the month, at 
$3,1 billion for the year. 
In other categories, national ads generated 18.5 per cent more revenue in January, a $1.7 billion annual rate. 
Of that national figure, automobile ad revenue was 28.6 per cent higher for 
January; general advertising revenue rose 16.7 per cent. 
Tax cut at a glance 

SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS— Wednesday March 9 1977 
F 

Here is the tax-cut plan as ap­ proved by the House Ways and 
Means Committee: 

• A tax rebate of $5o for each taxpayer and each of his depen­ dents, which most persons will re­ ceive in May and June. The rebate would be mailed to persons who file tax returns — not to their depen­ dents. 

Those who paid less than $5o in tax in 1976 would get back all they paid. Persons earning between 
$25,ooo and $3o,ooo would get less than $5o. Those making more than 
$3o,ooo would get nothing. Similar payments would go to Social Secur­ ity beneficiaries, welfare recipients and others too poor to pay taxes. 

• A permanent increase in the standard deduction, which is used by 69 per cent of the taxpayers. The current minimum-maximum stan­ dard deduction would he replaced by a flat figure of $2,4oo for single persons and $3,ooo for couples. 

This would result in a $166-a-vear tax cut for a typical $12,5oo family of four that does not itemize deduc­ 

 tions. Itemizers would get nothing, but tax experts predict that 5.5 million persons-who now itemize will find it to their advantage to shift to the standard deduction. 

The higher standard deduction would be reflected in lower taxes withheld from paychecks, starting 
May I. 

• Extension through 1978 of the existing general tax credit, which allows a taxpayer to cut bis taxes by cither $35 for himself and each de­ pendent or by 2 per cent of his first 
$9,ooo of taxable income; a special earned-inconie credit of up to $4oo a year for poor working families, and of lower corporate tax rates aimed at helping small business. 

• A special tax credit to give bu­ sinesses an incentive to hire new employes. In effect, the government would pay $1,68o of the first $4,2oo in wages paid to each new worker who is hired this year and next year so long as the company already has expanded its work force by 3 per cent. The government estim ates hiring will increase by 3 per cent annually even without the incentive. 
CALIFANO 

Student Financial Assistance within the Office of Education. 
There are now seven student aid programs fragmented within the Of­ fice of Education and the Health Re­ source Administration, agencies which have been marked, said Califano by 
“ poor m an agem ent, confusing re ­ quirements. lack of quality control and fraud and abuse." 
• Placement of all “ human deve­ lopment" and "social services" pro­ gram s under an expanded Office of 
Human Development. 
This includes a variety of service program s affecting children and youths, families, the disabled and the aged such as day care, foster care. family planning and legal services. 
This and the above changes will result in the abolition of the Social and Re­ habilitation Service. 

In addition, said Califano. he is re­ fining the 
“ top d epartm ental management structure." cutting sup­ port staff from 16(1 to IOO and elimin­ ating certain units within the secre­ tary's office. 
He said the estimated savings are expected to result from improved ef­ 

 forts to reduce needless spending and root out fraud and abuse and will not result in any individual loss of em ­ ployment. 
"Several hundred positions may be eliminated by attrition, but each indi­ vidual presently employed in HEW who wants to continue to work in the department can do so," he said. 
Efficiency 
Acknowledging that it is far easier to announce a fundamental reorganiza­ tion than to implement proposed plans adequately, Califano said that the 
"Carter administration’s emphasis on reorganization is not managerial fas­ cination with box-shifting and line- drawing on an organization chart, but rather a profound dedication to go­ vernment that is credible because it is humane and efficient." 
On a personal note, Califano recalled working in the 196os "for a president 
(Johnson) who had noble dream s about America and who expanded our vision of what government might do. 
. In the 197Us I work for a President who also cares deeply about America's poor and vulnerable citizens but who wants to make sure that the promise of government becomes reality for those whom government serves."

"the country’s most sophisticated cri­ minal element." 
In W ashington, a spokesman for 
Gonzalez said. "I know Henry has been deeply hurt by the leadership’s failure to support him. It is com pletely strange. Maybe someday we will know the full story of why. 
"Henry will probably end up being a maverick, but he's been there before." 
Gonzalez said he planned to take a break from Washington because in his 
25 years in public tile he has been without a break. 
" I ’ve decided to know my God bet­ 

 ter. myself, my family and my grand children." he said. 
The spokesman in Washington said his staff did not know when the eon gressman would return there. 
No power 
Earlier Tuesday, Gonzalez said. "I don’t care how the House votes or whether it votes at all. 
"No power or combirfation of powers on this earth can make me preside over the committee again. I ve had it with that miserable clot of yo-yo’s. 
"You’ve heard of the right to work law? Well. I’m standing on the right to quit law. and that’s final."

By ROBERT TIEMANN 
Reginald Row e s exhi­ bition at Hie McNay Art 
Institute through March 
19 is long overdue: 
Rowe has lived and painted in San Antonio since 1964 and this is his first one-man museum show. 
His influence as a teacher at the San An­ tonio Art Institute is of great importance and his former students have created the core of a li­ vely art group in the city. 
Most artists Rowe’s age who live outside the major cultural centers such as New York and 
Los Angeles cease to re­ spond to the best art of their time and instead work in eccentric, intro­ verted styles that are the result of their frustration with trying to be a part of something they do not understand. 
Dilemma 
Rowe, on the other hand, has managed to avoid this dilemma and continues to evolve in re­ lationship to contempor­ ary painterly problems 
The best piaee in the show is “ Homage to Bach

 blended colors of the other paintings, this painting works because of its strong color pre­ sentation and because the five vertical lines are not forced to act as structure but are free to float in front of the surface. 
In the paintings where line must be the struc­ ture, the lines are never strong enough to support the illusionistic color modulations. 
Consistent 
The most consistently good works are Row e s small chalk studies. 
Because of their spon­ taneity, one finds the bright, crisp color that I suspect lies just below the surface of the larger paintings. 
Luxor and Nefertiti's 
Dream seem to promise a profitable new direc­ tion for Rowe’s future work.

Gloom of night may not be able to stay this courier from his appointed rounds, but a stray rear wheel on this Postal Service van m anaged to slow things down a bit. The van was southbound in the 24oo block of Broadway about 8 p.m. Tuesday when the wheel flew off and the van flipped on its side. Police Patrolman John Mayberry examines the van. The driver, examined at the scene by Emergency Medical Service technicians, was not injured. — Staff Photo by

Court upends heroin finding 

A federal appeals court has reversed the heroin co n sp iracy of F a u s tino 
Le yva, who w as F'red 
Gom ez 
C arrasco ’s brother-in-law. 
The 5th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in New 
O rleans said there was not enough evidence to convict Leyva and Leon­ ard o C e rd a 
“ P o r k y " 
B a r r e r a in D e c e m b e r 
1976. 
Leyva re m a in s in fe­ d eral p riso n at T e x a r­ kana to serve a four-year prison sentence for using a telephone to facilitate eom m ision of a felony. 
U.S. Dist. Judge John ll Wood Jr. had handed down 3o-year sentences after a jury convicted 
Leyva, B arrera and two others on conspiracy to possess heroin for d istri­ bution and possession of more than 1.5 pounds of heroin. 
Defense attorney Alan

Judge Wood should have granted the motion. 
Brow n said Leyva was very happy about the ap­ p a ls court decision.

Nielsen raps 
Pyndus policy 

By SARA MARTINEZ 
An incum bent City Council candidate 
W ednesday night challenged another incumbent in the sam e district on his policy of fiscal responsibility. 
City Councilm an I). FN»rd Nielsen, running in District 8 criticized C oun­ cilm an Phil Pyndus* recom m endation to reduce the city budget. The con­ frontation cam e at a P T -A m eeting at 
Colonies North Elem entary School. 
All six candidates from District 8 spoke to parents and responded to questions at the meeting. Other candi­ dates are F'red B arricklo u , David C. 
Brown Jr., Winifred Veiler and Steven 
R. VYoIfson. 
’’We need careful m anagem ent of tux dollars and fiscal accountability,” 
Pyn d us said. 
Ile added he was the only person to vote against increases in the city bud­ get twice. The two increases have sent the budget from $87 m illion to $136 million. 
Responsibility 

Nielsen said Pyn dus was challenging a less than IO per cent increase 
“ We have reduced police and fire­ men m anpow er now .” N ielsen said. 
“ Additional cuts would have reduced m anpow er further, I cannot call this fiscal responsibility.” 
Pyndus said he objected to payment of unlim ited sick leave because the city could not afford it. “ There is a sh o r­ tage of patrolm en and the budget does not show where we can get funds. T h is is where the m anagem ent standpoint conies in ." 

B a rric k lo u ch allen ged the two in ­ cum bents sa y in g the C ity C o u n c il's inability to plan and its inattention to what is going on iii Austin contributed to Hie sick jiay controversy 
“ We would not lie i ii tills hassle of sick pay and retirem ent ii the C ity 
Council hail paid attention to what was going on at Hie capitol,” Burriek- 
Iou said 
B a rric k lo u also questioned budget in c re a s e s 
’ People pay in g i i int) a year in taxes now will Im* paying over 
$5,UUU in three years We cannot ufiord 

 the price of this go ve rn m e n t,” B ar- ricklow said. 
Brow n said good planning is essen­ tial so the taxpayers can save money and avoid unnecessary expenditures. 
“ We have to keep the downtow n area alive and find a solution for drainage p ro b le m s,” B ro w n sa id . “ A ll th is would come under good planning.” 
’’The city and City Council have to be prepared to meet increasing needs by developing to get the most of tax dol­ lars.” Brow n said. 
Brow n said he would favor zero-base budgeting in all city departm ents 
Vetters also suggested a lower tax basi*. a d d in g , “ T h e utility p ro b lem should have been settled a long tim e ago." 
Park proposed 

"D ist ric t 8 needs a good city park and I th in k the land o ver the (F’d* w ards) aquifer is a good choice.’" she said. 
The candidate said she favored re­ duction of speed lim its in n e ig h b o r­ hood streets and resurfacing of streets instead of continual patching 
VYoIfson, an attorney, concentrated on the C ity P u b lic S e rv ic e and lls method of selecting board trustees. 
“ T h e C P S board is a foFm of g o ­ v e rn m e n t." VYoIfson said. " l l takes money, condem ns land and prosecutes and defends law suits in the nam e of 
San Antonio.” 
“ Yet. it is not accountable to voters 
It is a self-perpetuating Ixia rd. Other trustees caucus to select a new trustee when a vacancy occurs,” VV oil son said.

T eaching hospital aid bill in trouble 

By DICK M ER K EL 
CHIEF, EXPRESS CAPITOL BUREAU 
AUSTIN - Back in I he early and optimistic days of the 65th Legislature, s t a t e f i n a n c i a l aid to teaching . hospitals was the No. I priority with most of the Bexar County legislative delegation 
Now, 57 days into the 
14o day session, most of th e d e l e g a t e s a r e still clinging to the priority. 
It's the optimism that's waning. 
The truth of the m atter is. SB6o by Sen. Chet 
Brooks of Pasadena, and 
HBI4 by Rep. Mickey 
Leland of Houston, are in trouble. 
Identical bills 
Both bills are identical. 
They would allow the 
U n i v e r s i t y of 
T e x a s 
C o o r d i n a t i n g B o a rd to contract with the te a c h ­ ing hospitals to u nderw ­ rite the cost of medical education co nducted at each. 
Beneficiaries would be the Bexar. 
Harris and 
Lubbock County Hospital 
Districts, Houston's Her­ m a n n Hospital, and the 
Fort Worth Osteopathic 
Hospital. 
S e c o n d a r y b e n e f i ­ ciaries of the legislation would be th e p r o p e r t y ow n ers of each distric t who are now bearing an estimated $8o million a n ­ nu al cost w ith t h e i r taxes. 
And, h e r e i n lies the rub. 
Fiscal note 
The Legislative Budget 
Board has attached a fis­ cal note to the B r o o k s ’ bill estimating the cost to the state at $1oo million to u n d e r w r i t e th e first two years. 
E v en B ro o k s and L e ­ land are saying now they have two chances of get­ ting this type of funding for t h e i r bills — s li m , and none. 
After weeks of holding his SB6o on the calendar of th e S e n a t e . B r o o k s m ade a move to bring it u p for c o n s i d e r a t i o n 
Monday. 
In o r d e r to s u s p e n d 
Senate rules and have the 
Heists suspect indicted 

An A ustin m a n who was shot and captured by an FBI agent in Austin was indicted Tuesday for two San Antonio bank r o b b e r i e s a n d for a s ­ saulting a federal officer. 
Roberto Ram irez. 45. was charged by a federal grand jury here for alle­ gedly robbing the Brooks 
Field National Bank and 
Harlandale State Bank. 
R am irez was shot in the mouth Feb. 18 as he tried to escape capture by FBI a g e n ts . He is charged with assault in that incident. 
He a l l e g e d l y n e t t e d 
$17.65(1 iii the J a n . 26 robbery at H a rla n d a le 
State Bank and 96,3oo in the Feb. 14 robbery at 
Brooks F ield National 
Bank. 
A c o m p l a i n t filed against Ramirez Monday alleged he paid for the getaway car used in the 
Brooks Field job with money stolen from Har­ landale State Bank. 
Iii a n o t h e r case, tin grand jury indicted John 
Wesley DeSha/o. 38. of 
‘JHI \V 
Laurel St., for allegedly mailing a letter c o n t a i n i n g a t h r e a t against Vice Preaident 
Walter Mondale. 
The indictment alleges 
DeSha/o mailed the let­ ter Nov 
I to U.S. Magis­ trate F r a n k J 
Baskin t h r e a t e n i n g to i n j u r e then-l S. Simi 
Mondale, who was campaigning for vice president 
DeShazo is scheduled to appear in federal court h e r e M a r c h 21 for a he a rin g on his m e nial competency. 
He is in Bexar County 
Jail without bond after completing psychological t e s t i n g at I tie fed e ra l p r is o n h o s p i t a l at 
Springfield, Mo. 
The grand jury also in­ dicted G eorge P

 bill considered. Brooks needed 25, or four-fifths of the Senate’s 31 votes. 
Monday lie got 22. 
Deadline 
A ft er 
F rid ay, th e de a d lin e for r e g u l a r of filing bills in this session. 
Iif.1 will only need two- thirds, or 21 votes. 
Brooks feels lie can get them and bring bis bill 

 up for d eb a te and even fin al p a s s a g e to th e 
House. 
But Brooks has had to face reality on a price lag for his bill. Gone is the idea of full financing. He is s u g g e s t i n g 
S e n a t e budget w riters e a r m a r k one-eighth of the total, or about SKI million, as the appropriation level. 
Over in the House. Le- 

A n a n a ly s is 

 land races the sa m e fis­ cal roadblock along with still another in the direc­ tion of th e 
H ouse 
Speaker's office. 
S p e a k e r Bill Clayton h as a l r e a d y i n f o rm e d 
L e l a n d he w a n t s a funding formula attached 

 to any teaching aid bill. 
The formula would r e ­ q u ire such aid be paid d ir e c tly to th e s t u d e n t d o c t o r, r e s i d e n t or t e a c h i n g f a c u lty member. 
In short, Clayton wants the aid to be m ore of a 

 s c h o la rs h ip paid to the individual, than a fund­ ing to th e te a c h in g ho­ spitals themselves. 
There is some merit to 
Clayton's proposal, even 
Leland admits. 
It would give financial a s s i s t a n c e to m e d i c a l 

 trainees at all hospitals with a teaching function. not just those in the UT system. 
But the obvious d r a w ­ back is the fact no money will go to th e h o sp ital d i s t r i c t s t h e m s e l v e s — the refore, no tax relief for the district ad valor­ em tax payers. 
Leland now a d m its if any hill finally comes out 

 of the House it will he a compromise between his measure and the wishes of Speaker Clayton. 
He only h o p e s th e co m p ro m is e will retain so m e e l e m e n t of relief for the hospital district's and th e ir a l re a d y o v e r ­ burdened tax payers. 
Also, realistically, Le­ land sees no better fi­ nancial break than about 

$2o m il lio n fro m the 
House A p p r o p r i a t i o n s 
‘Committee. 
But. as Leland puts it. 
“ it will he a s ta rt . I d rath e r see some sort of an aid bill than no aid bill at all.” 
The q u estion is. will the B e x a r County d e l e ­ gates even recognize the hill w h en it finally em erges — if it emerges?

Fort Worth limits take- or-pay clauses in natural 

 worse than no bill at all. 
Rep. John Wilson of 
LaGrange debated long and hard against the bill s ta tin g ta k e -o r-p a y should be outlawed alto­ gether. 
“ What justification is th ere for c h a r g in g customers for gas they have not u se d ? Even under this bill,” Wilson said, “ payment for gas not taken is nothing more than a forced loan from the consumer to the pro­ ducer.” 
Wilson a tte m p te d to amend the bill by lower­ ing the take-or-pay per­ centage to IO per cent. 
I lint he lost by a narrow 72 to 87 vote. 
HB873 was considered a com prom ise between its authors and the gas producers. The level had 
I been originally set at HO per cent but raised to the 
Hi) per cent figure when industry representatives said they could live with this figure and would offer no opposition to the bill. 
Rep. Dan K ubiak of 
[Rockdale was successful in dropping the level to 85 per cent by a 79 to 58 vote. 
Rep. J im N ugent of 
Kerrville also was suc­ cessful in getting an amendment added to re­ quire producers to share with landowners the re­ venue they obtain under the take-or-pav for gas not actually sold. 
The 
B exar 
County 
House delegation voted ll) to 2 for the 
W ilson amendment, adoption of which many felt would have killed the bill. 
Voting for adoption of the Wilson IO per cent amendment were: Reps. 
Hon Bird. Al Brown. Don 
( artwright. Matt Garcia, 
Joe L. Hernandez, Frank 
Madia. Abe Ribak, Lou 
Nolle 
S u tto n, 
F r a n k 
Tejeda and Bob Vale. 
Opposing the Wilson amendment were Nowlin and Rep. Don Rains. 
Bexar delgates also fa­ vored the 
K ub iak amendment which set the 
85 per cent level. 1o-2. 
Brown and Rains cast the only two no votes against the proposal. 
On the amendment to ra ise the ta k e -o r-p ay time limit to three years, 
Bexar delegates voted for it 8-3 with Hernandez ab­ sent and Brown. Nowlin and Rains opposed. 
If the bill wins final approval as expected on 
Wednesday, it will go to the Senate. 

 gas contracts. 
A fter two key p ro ­ consum er am endm ents were tacked on, it was passed to third reading and ap p aren t passage 
Wednesday by a 1o2 to 38 vote. 
The amended bill pro­ hibits contracts re q u ir­ ing the buyer to take more than 65 per cent of the seller’s deliverable 

 gas. and also gives buyers th ree y ears to m ake up shortfalls in their purchases. 
Take-or-pay contracts co m m it p ip e lin e c o m ­ panies to pay producers for a certain amount of gas, even if demand de­ clines and they cannot use it at all. 
S ch ieffer said gas prices to consumers rise 

 e m e rg e d a fte r n e a rly three hours of debate, the right to take provision had been extended to three years and the per­ cen tag e a p u rc h a s e r could be held to had been cut to 65 per cent. 
The amendments were a clear victory for op­ ponents of the bill who argued the original co m p ro m ise bill w as 

 veraI changes. 
The original bill began 
Tuesday morning with a two year limit for pur­ chasers to take any gas paid for but not taken at the time of purchase. It also prohibited contracts requiring the buyer to take more than 8o per cent of the seller's deli­ verable gas. 
By the tim e the bill 

Votes by Senate show how legislature 

 for e x am p le, has con­ tended that on occasion, take-or-pay has added a dime per 1,ooo cubic feet mcf of gas. 
D ebate over the bill was heated Tuesday and the bill went through se- 

 when pipeline companies must pay producers for gas they don’t recieve. 
“This bill will ease the burden on the consumers and ratep ayers of Tex­ as,” he said.

California’s drought a warning to Texas 

The Western United States is in a drought of two years' dura­ tion and this week California 
Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown .lr. warned of the possibility of “ a disaster of unmeasurable m ag­ nitude.” 
His state is drafting a con­ tingency plan for water ration­ ing. The plan, if it has to be in­ voked. would be m andatory upon the s ta te ’s 21.5 m illion persons. Bul if rationing has to be imposed on California, the impact will be felt nationwide. 
Gardens outside Southern Cali­ fornia will be much less pro­ ductive. 
California and som e other 
Western states can forecast the magnitude of their problem with somber accuracy. Unless rain com es soon and unless the mountains get big snows, the two-year drought will be pro­ longed. 
Snowpacks feeding state water supplies are SO per cent below normal. 
California has done a remark­ able job with its water plan. 
Water is transported great dis­ tances to irrigate the fertile farm land and water the big cities. T exas water planners have profited by studying the 
California long-range planning. 
T exas has m ade progress toward developing water re­ sources and m aking provision for protecting water quality and 

 transporting water from reser­ voirs to where it is needed. 
We have a way to go. 
San Antonio is still trying to find the best way to insure its water quality and to arrange a back-up supply. South Texas was gripped in a five-year drought in the 195os and that experience shouldn’t be forgot­ ten. Planners should assume it will be repeated. 
Water policy for San Antonio has to include at least two pri­ mary points. One is the protec­ tion of the underground source. 
The other is a method for fin­ ancing expensive importation and treatment of surface water. 
Work is advancing on the first item, but there is still a standoff on the second. 
Still another point that mer­ its high priority consideration for our region is water for irri­ gation. Truck farming here is important to the city dwellers. 
The truck farm ers have been dislocated at least twice in mo­ dern tim es and good planning will give merited consideration to fertile land near the city. 
The w inter’s freak pattern has encouraged latent city- dw elling gardeners to start tilling the soil. But planning has to put the country in position to respond when the weather up­ sets its routine. Nature's whim can be an aw esom e force for mere humans to endure.

The aquifer orders 

T hird W orld isn’t interested in hum an rights struggles 

So much for United Nations interest in human rights in 
Uganda. The automatic majori­ ty of Third Worlders on the 
U.N. Human Rights C om m is­ sion, meeting for the past month in London and scheduled to ad­ journ Thursday, shows no inter­ est a all in sending investigators to Uganda. 
The com m ission aligned heavily against the West was set to reject a United States move to persuade the com m is­ sion to send a telegram to Soviet authorities requesting informa­ tion “ on the circu m stan ces surrounding the reported a r­ rests of human rights activists.” 
The non-aligned countries’ delegates said they didn’t want 

 to get involved. The U.S. with­ drew its motion. 
Britain was still pressing for action on Uganda but the outlook was dim. 

Reason for U. S. and British interest is specific. Their stand for human rights is a serious and realistic concern. 

Furthermore, they want to test the Soviet commitment to the Helsinki agreement on re­ spect for human rights. 
The response on Uganda re­ flects, among other things, a callous lack of appreciation for human rights by many countries of the world. It is, therefore, important for the West to keep pressing for that appreciation. 

Anne A rm strong returns hom e 

Anne Armstrong is coming back home. 
The Texas Republican who has resigned after a year at the 
Court of St. Jam es as the 
Am erican am bassador has done a remarkable job in Eng­ land — the people there agree. 
Mrs. Armstrong is a South 
Texan. She has become a leader of her party both in Texas and in the United States. She was a 

 m em ber of the Nixon White 
House staff as a top adviser. The change of administrations led to her resignation. Her successor hasn't been nominated. 

We trust she hasn’t finished her public career. Her talents have been proved and Texas 
Republicans should keep her at work in the interest of a stronger two-party challenge. 

Sir: Re: Your story of March 4. 1977. re g a rd in g approval by the Texas 
Water Quality Board of .separate coun­ ty orders for the Edwards Aquifer. 
You gave a complete listing of those from San Antonio who testified against the separate order but mentioned only four persons and organizations testify­ ing for the separate orders. 
You failed to mention the following: 
.Judge Tommy Seargeant of Kinney 
County: the Middle Rio (band e Deve­ lopment Council; Mayor George Moore of Sabinal; Association of Women for 
Water Quality; Nueces, Frio and Sa­ binal Soil and W ater Conservation 
District; Uvalde County Farm Bureau; 
Uvalde County Water Protection Asso­ ciation; U valde C h a m b e r of Com ­ merce; Uvalde Jaycees; Uvalde Rotary 
Club; U valde Lions Club; U valdt 
Kiwanis Club; Uvalde Optimist Club; 
B rackettville R otary Club; Knippa 
Lions Club; El Progreso Club (J Uvalde and the county judge of Hays County. 
Your reporter also erred in saying that Kinney County opposed the separ­ ate orders. 
And finally I believe you will find that Medina County is for the separate orders although no one from Medina 
County testified at the hearing on 
March J, 1977. 
John W . W hite, 
Executive Director, 
Nueces River Authority 

(NOTE: None of the people or or­ ganizations listed by White were at the hearing. White merely said he had letters from all of the organizations and said he Has testifying for Judge 
Seargeant. 
(White is wrong when he says Me­ dina County is for the separate orders. 
Medina County, represented by Leon 
Tschirhart, testified AGAINST the se­ parate orders at the Uvalde hearing on 
Jan. 13. This is recounted in the 
TWQB’s lengthy report on that public hearing, which White apparently hasn't read very closely. 
(Ile is right when he says Kinney 
County is for the separate orders. That was the single error in the Express’ story on the March 3 Austin meeting.) 
D oonsbury draws som e criticism 
Sir: Re: Doonsbury by (larry Tru­ deau: 
If you insist in keeping tins claptrap in your otherwise good newspaper I would suggest you relegate it lo the 
IMilitical section of tin* paper rather than the comic section. 
I con sider m yself to be ra th e r broadminded. Inn when drivel such as the issue in which Pennsbury states, 
“ Look, kids. I'm a reasonable man but if Jennifer doesn't move her little . . 
This followed by “ can't you see I'm with child and about to burst into tears?!" 
Then, "Jenny will you get the lied out of here,’’ 
And the piece de resistance, “ Jen von gotta explain the Lama/e method lo me,” I’m compelled to write and ask you to replace this strip with a comic. 
I'm sure there are plenty of comics looking for space in a comic section. lf your contract cannot he broken

Price up — so shortage goes 

Sir: The letter “ Congress finally awakes to crisis” by A H. Thomas brings a question to mind. 
In 1972, oil corporations were offer­ ing me premiums in the form of table glasses, etc., if I would purchase IO gallons or more of reasonably priced 

 gasoline to improve their volume of sales. 
About one year later they forced me to wait in long lines at corporation- operated stations for a reasonably priced product. These actions were explained as resulting from a shortage of petroleum. 
Alter a while, when the price for petroleum products had doubled — or more — I no longer had lo wait in line to buy any amount of an extremely high-priced product. 
A parallel situation with natural gas existed in San Antonio. In 1973. there were dire predictions of electrical blackouts and insufficient energy. based on a supply of reasonable priced natural gas. As time went on. and prices for natural gas tripled — or more — none of these threats m ater­ ialized. I now purchase an am ple supply »tf electricty and/or gas at an increase in utility bills of around 83 per cent. 
How can the action of the governor, when looking into energy shortages, be described: “ And Governor Shapp idio­ tically asks if the situation is real or contrived!!”

WASHINGTON - President 
( arter trotted around the Pen­ tagon last week for a ques- tion-and-answer session with defense employes. 

Ile was asked uImjuI unionization in the military forces 
The P re s id e n t said: “ My own opinion, which is strongly held, is that it would not Im1 advisable to have the military personnel unionized.” 
The President said he knew of no strong move iii this direction; no labor leaders had approached hun about it; he had no plans for spon­ soring legislation to forbid unioniza­ tion, but lf the prohibition seemed to tx* heating up. he would attempt to engender public support for his posi­ tion. 

Time to start 
( a rte r m ight be well advised to start engendering. 
Last September the American Fe­ deration of Government Employees 
< AFGE) specifically authorized mili­ tary membership*. 
David Uortilght, ail associate with the C enter for N ational S ecu rity , reports that “ an actual organizing 

 drive may begin w ithin a few months.” 
Far from being anyone’s fancy, 
I'ortright says, “ unionism in the 
A m erican m ilitary has becom e a pressing issue.” 
Fantastic 
The p ro sp e c t m ay s trik e most 
Americans as fantastic — it strikes me as disastrous — but military un­ ionization is far advanced in Europe. 
Writing in the Defense Review til the American Enterprise Institute, 
Curl right ably summarizes the argu­ ments iii favor of military unions. 
Sen. S trom T h u rm o n d , It-S.(’., argues with equal fervor against them, 
I stan d fo u r-sq u a re with T h u r ­ mond. 
The two advocates agree on this much — that troublesome conditions exisl among the ranks of both enlist­ ed personnel and professional of­ ficers. 
* The e n liste e s anti noncom s are concerned with all the usual gripes over pay. food. housing, anti even the length to which h air m ust be trimmed. 
Officers are increasingly vexed by what seem s to be a steady curtail­ ment til their fringe benefits. 

In civilian life, these are among the issues ait industrial union would deal* with, ll is small wonder that the AFCE, enchanted by the prospect of two million dues-puyiag union members, amended its constitution to authorize 
Hit1 formation of military locals. 
Acknowledging all this, most ob­ servers probably would regard the move as unthinkable. 
G ranted, citizens do not give up their First Amendment rights when they volunteer for military service; they are free “ peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a’ redress of grievances ’ 
Advocates 
Hut it is preposterous to transform lins haste right into a right lo bargain collectively, to negotiate on working conditions, and even — incredibly — to strike, 

The advocates of military unionism doubtless will soothe objectors by disavowing any thought of interject­ ing union democracy into policy de­ cisions. 
But if the A FG E's now-dormant seeds ever germinate, it is hard to sen* a stopping point. lf military unions can negotiate a 
4o-hour workweek with extra pay for overtim e, as they have iii several 
European countries, they tun nego­ tiate just about anything. 
“ Move o u t!” cries the captain. 
"Let s take that hill!” 
“ No can do,” says the steward of 
Local 5o7. 
* “ The men still have *2o minutes on their lunch break; we have a union m eeting at 4 o’clock; and the m em bers voted lust night against further overtime or weekend work lor the rest of the month. Take the lull yourself." 
Fallacy 
The fallacy iii the concept of mili­ tary unionism lies in the notion that military service tall In* equated with private employment 
No way. 
The armet! forces traditionally anti cofisititutionulI.Y have operated lintier 

 different obligations aud different law. 
Military service is inherently auth­ oritarian; it cannot be m ade demo­ cratic. 
F ortu nately, the* proposition a p ­ pears to command little public* sup- 
|M»rt. 
One public opinion poll, cited by 
Thurmond in his argument, finds 82 lier cent of the people opposed. 
A recent survey of 938 members of the Air Force indicated that only 38 per cent of the enlisted personnel and 
18 per cent of the officers would join a union. 
Half pf the Air Force respondents said they believed unionization would hurt discipline and decrease effec­ tiveness. 
.Momentum 
( arter may be right, and (.’ortright wrong, in estimating the momentum toward military unions. 
The movement may not la* growing at all 
II so, rungless should act to prohi­ bit unionization now, rallier than a few years lienee when it may ta* tt»o hie. 
Thurmond lias a lull that says flat­ ly, no. 
The bill ought to la* passed. 

D ecent wom en getting angry 

CHICAGO — I must admit that my attitudes toward the 
Parent T eacher A ssociation have rather changed with my age. 

As a gram m ar school waif, I saw its members as solid, surrogate mothers of the m iddle and working classes: discipline at home extended to school. 
Then, as I grew older, I thought of them as bourgeois bulw arks of the community, i.e., with accustomed mo­ desty, women rather like myself. 
Mata Hari-ish 

Now, to my great interest. I find they are something else, something even a bit Mata Hari-ish. 
In the hearings investigating vio­ lence on television that have suddenly become as fashionable as Amy’s dogs and cats, the seven million women of the FTA have been accused of every­ thing from waging a 
McCarthyite witch hunt to censorship to (the most delicious, bv far) being “ elitists.” 
Elitists! 
That was the word Spiro Agnew used to describe those of us of the press, in addition to everyone else with a modi­ cum of brains and a modicum of mon­ ey who didn't take envelopes under the table. 
The word also crops up regularly in 
M arxist lite ra tu re (along with “ in­ fantile le f tis ts " and “ re v isio n ist pigs” ). 
But the PT A? 
Rule by elite 

My new dictionary of 2,887 pages 
(not being a genuine elitist, it took me awhile just to find the word) defines elitist as one who believes in “ rule by an elite.” 
I must admit I never heard of Willie 
Mae Williams or Birgitta Svenson or 
Mollie Slavick talking about that in the 
PT A meetings of my youth. 
What they seem ed downright tire­ some about to m e was getting their children “ educated right." 
Yet there it was. 
In only one recent hearing of many, this one in Los Angeles, Van Gordon 
Slater, a CBS-TV vice president, called the FTA women “ rig hteo us indivi­ duals" and “ elitists” who thought that the “ anonymous television viewer . . . lacks the discretion or the discipline or the insight to know what is best for him.” 
Gets started 
AU of this got started approximately two years ago, when the national FTA. its offices located here, responded to its m em bers’ concerns by deciding to hold hearings on TV violence in its eight regions. 
They met with extraordinary suc­ cess. 
In the day-long hearings (which of­ ten went late into the night), people 
(ought to testify (in Atlanta, there were 
4IHI requests). 
What's more, the American Medical 
A ssociation and o th er professional groups, us well as companies, backed them up. 
But then the attacks from most, if not all. of the broadcasters’ represen­ ta tiv e s, c a m e. The re c y cle d W il­ liam ses and Svensons and Slavicks were labelled pure demons. 
New genre 

Iii the last couple of days. I have been talking to these "elitists” of the 
FTA. thin king so m e new g en r e of mother might have arisen since my childhood. 
But no. 
All I could find was that this was the first time they had gone public so dra­ matically on such a controversial sub­ ject and had been so utterly dogged about it. 
For instance, when the broadcasters argued that they used violent shows because the country was lucking in creative talent, the women went to the 
Screen Writers Guild, who told them d e a rly that it was the broadcasters who forced upon them super-violent plots because they were catchy — and cheap. 
So indeed, there are elitists in this. but who are they? 
It strikes me that most of the TV executives I have known were liberal- minded, upper middle class men who live m cushy suburbs and let-them- eat-cakc-sty Ie. They seem to be saying the “ people" should have their Ro­ man circuses because thai is all thev can absorb. 
Gladiators 
The TV cops are today's gladiators; the killers are the lions and the FTA women, perhaps, could he cast as the 
Christians? 
It all comes down to the fact that there is no real reason for violent pro­ gram m ing except sheer and sim ple commercialism. 
The broadcasters, who talk so much about “ giving the people what they want,’’ get downright pettish when the people dem and what they really do want, 
Hot, thanks to the “ elitist ladles’' of the FTA, it looks very much like TV may hem is in serious trouble 
As first Vice President Mrs Grate 
Baisinger puts it partly, “ T here is nothing as strong as an idea whose time has come.“ 
I might add thai there is nothing quite so fearsome — rn this age or any 
— as a decent woman who has gotten just plain angry.

LOS ANGELES Tim es service 
W A SH IN G T O N - Jim m y 
Carter was in Adm. Hyman G. 
Rickover s organization fo r l e s s than a year before Carter r e ­ signed from the Navy. 
He had talked with the admiral only twice in 23 yea rs before C a rte r was inaugurated as president. 
President Carter says, however. that he has tried to adopt Rickover leader­ ship techniques. 
' ‘His o r g a n iz a ti o n a l a b i l i t y , ” the 
P resid en t said, “ was something I al­ ways a dm ired, particularly his atten­ tion to detail.” 
Carter said that when he started his p resid e n tia l c a m p a i g n , he used the a d m i r a l ’s technique for acquainting himself personally with small opera­ tional details. 
And he said he now has a relation­ ship with his staff sim ilar to that of 
Rickover with his subordinates. 
‘Very demanding' 
“ He is very dem andin g of people,” the P r e s i d e n t s a i d , “ a n d I g u e s s m e m b ers of my staff would say that I am the sam e way.” 
When Rickover and his wife were invited to the White House for lunch on the third weekend after the inaugura­ tion, the conversation dealt with both business and social affairs, the Presi­ dent recalled.

They touched on the controversial

S h i p p in g p o rt. P a . , as a “ b r e e d e r ” reactor, producing more uranium fuel than ii uses . 
Success seen 
“ My guess, knowing Adm. Rickover, is that it will be successful, on-time, relatively inexpensive, and its design principles will be flexible and com pa­ tible with existing facilities,” the 
President said. 
When C’a rte r moved into the White 
House Oval Office, he put two things on his desk — a Bible and a small plaque with a prayer that Rickover com m ends to his subm arine skippers: “ o Lord. 
T h y sea is so great and my boat is so sm all.” 
The political foundation supporting 

Rickover is a form of handiwork as e l e g a n t in its own w ay as a finely machined nuclear reactor. 
While \ jews differ on his competence iii other fields, he*is an acknowledged m a ste r of the art of congressional re­ lations. 
Long ago, he recognized how v u l­ nerable politicians become because of their own vanity. 
He found the crucial congressional p r e s s u r e points and th e people who counted. 
He learned the th e m e s that never grow old. 
Almost by hi nisei I 
He has been, and is today, in a class almost by himself as a congressional witness, arm e d with quotations from philosophers, poets and patriots, ready to share his views on subjects from sea lo shilling sea. and backed by a sta g­ g erin g w ealth of detail on th e U.S. 
Navy. 
To fine tune his appearances before friendly committees, he has made tin1 most of the not uncommon practice of jaunting questions and later sharpen- ing up official transcripts of his words. 
Over the years he has rem em bered c o n g r e s s i o n a l f r i e n d s in t o u c h i n g ways.

N E W SD A T SERVICE 
At Ft. Devens, Mass., at least 
5o Green Berets are trying to form a union. 
At Ft. Riley, Kau., IOO to ISO men, including six officers, have asked to join a union for civilian employes. 
Across the country, another civilian union is actively signing up reservists and guardsm en from all branches. 
At the Air Force Institute of Tech­ nology in Ohio, students conducted a survey last year which found that '.iii

Gaining 

O nce c o n s i d e r e d u n p a t r i o t i c , th e idea of unionizing America s two mil­ lion servicemen is gaining m o m en tu m and respect. 
Military j o u r n a l s are filial with a r ­ ticles on the subject. 
Congressional hearings are expected this y e a r , and th e r e is even a full- fledged counterdrive against unioniza­ tion 
Sen. Strom T hurm ond, R S.LL. and 
37 co-sponsors have introduced legis­ lation that would fine a union from 
$23.(HIO to $ IMUHX I for attempting to sign up serv icemen. 
Prohibition 

I ii the House, Rep Bill Nichols. D-

William L. Spence, president of the 
Association of G u a r d and R e s e rv e , agreed. 
The issues 
Both unions hope to deal with such issues as pay. r e t i r e m e n t be n e fits, c o m m i s s a r y p r i v i l e g e s , t r a v e l a l ­ lowances, leav es and tem porary duty pay. 
O ther questions, such as m is sion, duties, strategy and tactics, would be left to the military, both men said 
Spence’s organization, which is affi­ liated with a union fo r civilian e m ­ ployes of the Guard and Reserve, has been active for about a year, tie said 
He declined to give specific figures on ihe number of men who have signed up. but lie said that m e m b e r s h ip in­ d u d e s personnel on active duty as well a s in tlit* Reserve aud Guard

Some erosion 

Jackson has continued every other y e a r since 1963 to head the driv e to m ake sure the President rem e m b e rs to call Rickover to active service for a n ­ other two years. 
Jackson, who either talks with Rick­ 

 over or sees him every week. acknow­ ledges there are some signs that the adm iral's support iii Congress has e r ­ oded 
“ Some m e m b e r s now don't u n d e r ­ stand bim and don’t have enough p a ­ tience with h im .” he said. 
“ Some are not as tolerant as I am. 
Here is a guy who has given his whole life to bis co u n try , and I th in k t h e country owes him a debt.” 
Rickover after several years of rela­ tive peace w ith the Navy began to clash m o r e f re q u en tly with th e e s t a b l i s h ­ ment as the serv ice started facing up to the problem of replacing scores of ships that had become obsolete. 
Zumwalt story 
Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt .lr , who re ­ tired iii 1974 as chief of naval o p e ra ­ tions. d etailed his own s to rm y r e l a ­ tionship with Rickover in a book, "On

Zumwalt said Rickover went to Con­ gress and undercut his proposals for conventional ships after he had gotten approval for RJckover’s submarines. 
Zumwalt thereafter viewed Rickover us an anarchist In the Navy and to tins day maintains the adm iral is a m ajor obstacle to modernization of the fleet

The union leadership decided that a full scale drive had not yet been a uth­ orized. 
That authorization can come only if the union's 1.31X1 locals approve. 
The 15-member executive board will decide this week w hether to put the question to a vote later this spring lf it dues, it is difficult to predict how the vote will come out, Kenefick said. because the locals are about evenly div ided.

Collecting tools 

Ninety pounds of femininity — you’d think she might col­ lect crystal, Dresden or delicate laces. 
Instead, she heads for the garage or basem ent at estate sales and there she holds her own with other tool collectors. 
A c tu a lly , A b ig ail B. 
(Abby) is in te reste d in other things too, hut she shares an enthusiasm for tool collecting with her husband Bill. 
Because her hours are m o re flexible than his, sh e d o es m o st of th e searching and buying. On weekends, however, you v\ ill find them together at an au c tio n , an a n tiq u e shop or m useum in pur­ suit of tools and k now ­ ledge. 
Old tools h av e an a l ­ most universal appeal. A connoisseur of art glass will appreciate the glass blower’s pipe or cast iron gathering pot. 
A c o lle c to r of fine furniture will find value 

 in a pedal-operated tu rn ­ ing lathe. 
The Bs are interested in hand tools of any age. 
T heir first was a wood plane — the kind used for planing wood in which the glad (or iron) is filled in wood an d a d j u s te d with a wedge. 
This was an inherited item and it sparked their search for other planes. 
They now have 23 of v ar­ ying ages. 
C raftsm en tend to re ­ sist changes in tool styles and this has been espe­ cially tr u e of th e woo- den-body plane, they ex­ plained.

Since the basic design of tools changes slowly o v er a sp a n of m a n y years, it m ight even be possible to build a collec­ tion a ro u n d th e e v o lu ­ tionary changes in wood planes, for exam ple, or braces.

Halston likes bias cut 

Wednesday and Thurs­ day are days of local fa­ shion excitement. 

Halston’s spring-sum m er collection will be modeled in­ formally Wednesday in F rost's 
Downtown and T h u rs d a y in 
North Star Mall. 
R oslyn O strick will r e p r e ­ sent the New York designer at the showings. 
The H alston s u m m e r line was recently introduced to the press both in New York and 
Acapulco (the latter during a w ee k -e n d ja u n t for th e 
‘•beautiful people” sponsored by the Mexican Tourist Coun­ cil and Braniff International). 
The su m m er offerings range fro m w ra p p e d - w a is t sun-, dresses in tropical print crepe de chine, to party pants w hich sn u g the legs a lm o st like t he toreadors of the 5os, to 

 a gray chiffon shirtw aist din­ ner gown with gold belt (which had th e “ b e a u tifu l l a d i e s ’’ cheering). 
In every Halston collection, there s an air of easy elegance. 
And in e v e ry c o lle c tio n , th e re is U ltr a s u e d e — th e 
Halston tradem ark. 
Narrow 

For spring, he uses U ltra­ suede in one-piece dresses and suits, skirts and jackets — and his new, narrow er pants. 
In in tro d u cin g the narrow pant, Halston told the press: 
“ We feel s tro n g ly th a t this pant, which we are showing in other fabrics as well, w ill give ou r la d ie s a ta lle r, s le e k e r look.” 

T h e s p rin g c o lle c tio n , he said, “ is a natural evolution of my feeling for the provocative elegance of the bias cut.” 

T h is m ood c o n tin u e s for sum m er. 
The stra p less d resses and asym m etrical necklines which he noted “ were so enthusiasti­ cally received in fall and holi­ day groups,” are represented in the new w arm -weather col­ lections. 
There is also a bias n it, pictured at rig h t, w hich r e ­ sults in a leg-revealing pant- skirt. (The model showed how to w rap it on stage). 
Halston likes silk chiffon, silk crepe de chine, m atte je r­ sey a n d .luxurious silk c h a r­ meuse (which resem bles soft supple satin) for these new s h a p e s . W hite c h a r m e u s e tw o -p iec e, p a r ty p a n t c o s ­ tum es glitter like Neon in the spring collection. 
In Acapulco, he opened the sum m er showing with a group of print playdresses (som e in 

 blouson s ty lin g ) 
— w ith m atching shirts for the m ale models, very resort looking. 
For su m m er, he continues spring’s skinny legs, and gives w om en a ch o ice b etw e en d r e s s e s th a t a r e tig h tly wrapped at waistline (a near obi fashion) or full and free, a la the caftan. 
Also noteworthy in the su m ­ m er designs are h alter and 
V-necklines, capelet shoulders and s le e v e s , an d s w ir lin g skirts, often with godets. 
C otton je rs e y and cotton cloques are added to the su m ­ m er fabric line-up. He uses some short lengths in playwear, but doesn’t advocate the return of the mini. 
Black plays a provocative role for evening — particularly in resort dresses with cut-away midriffs. - MILDRED WHI­

Mrs. Kolbe was wear­ ing an unusual black dress with cross-stitched figures that looked 
Oriental. She bought the gown in Colima, Mexico, on a two-week painting trip her husband con­ ducted there. 
Caroline 
Rice is spending four days and three nights a week stu­ dying at the McNay Art 

Institute. And, 
Rose 
Marie Siebenhausen is teaching art to the Asso­ ciation of Retired P e r­ sons in a paint-along. She wants to exhibit her paintings with the wood carvings of her father, the late George Sieben­ hausen. A table he made took first prize at the 
Dallas Centennial. 
Beth Eidelberg and 
Tom Pressly were co­ chairmen of the exhibit, which continues until 
March 16. 

The literary party was the Wellesley Club’s Pa­ tro n s’ Dinner in the 
Spanish Governor’s P a­ lace honoring authors 
Suzanne Morris of Hous­ ton and Shelby Hearon of 
Austin. 
Mrs. Morris attended the party with her hus­ band. J.C. Morris, and his sister and brother-in- law, Mr. and Mrs. James 
Browder of Houston. 
Mrs. Hearon spends the month of July in

Colorado resort. 
Dr. and Mrs. P. M. Ku extended a welcome along with Mrs. Hal W. 
Lamb. Mrs. Ku has been in San Francisco visiting her son, 
Leighton, a graduate student at the university of California at Berkeley. 
During her visit she

Chinese Cultural Center, that l.ad ju st arrived from the Boston Mu­ seum. The exhibition in­ cluded reproductions of pictographs from China dating back to the Tang 
Dynasty. 

Mrs. Ku left before the Chinese New Year with its F ire Dragon 
Celebration and Parade so she could attend the 
Patrons’ Dinner. 

President is involved 

By LOIS HAASE 
Keeping one step ahead of 18,ooo Texas 
Clubwomen from ap­ proxim ately 
75o clubs is a gigan tic job, but Mrs. Robert 
N. Tipps of Denver 
City, Tex., finds it’s heartw arm ing and satisfying. 

’ 
Mrs. Tipps, president of the Texas Federation of W omen's Clubs, a r ­ rived in San Antonio and accompanied Mrs. H. S. 
Silvus Jr. to the Alamo 
D istrict's 17th annual convention held in 
Kerrville. Mrs. Silvus is district president. 

Hosting the meeting, themed. "Today: Yester­ day’s D ream ,” was the 
R ocksprings W om an’s 
Club. Many San Anton­ ians participated in the meeting. 

M rs. 
Tipps was speaker at the Awards 
Banquet. For 1977, the 
TFWC them e is “ Join 
Hands in Action.” 
“ I’ve always believed that everyone has to do 
. something beyond them­ selves,” she says. “ It doesn’t matter if you're a career woman or a hom em aker, you still need another outlet to become a real asset to your community. 
“ My husband and I have always been in-

 voiced in the life of our 
Methodist church, schools. Scouting pro­ gram s and other civic endeavors. 
“And before you become president of 
TFWC you’ve put in years climbing up the ladder,” she laughs. 

In 1972-73, she was named “ Citizen of the 
Year" in Denver City. 

In 1897 

Texas Federation, or­ ganized in 1897 with Mrs. 
Edward Rotan of Waco as first president, is affiliated with General 
Federation of Women’s 
Clubs, which has more that 13.ooo clubs in 49 states, District of Colum­ bia, Puerto Rico and 36 countries and territories. 
Mrs. Harry Wagner Jr. is 
GFWC president. 

“ Unity in Diversity’’ is the motto of General Fe­ deration. Thus each indi­ vidual club keeps its own uniqueness while under the huge um brella of 
GFWC. Each chooses its own projects and how much effort to devote to each. GFWC is the lar­ gest volunteer organiza­ tion of women in the world. 

Six departments under 
GFWC are conservation. 

MRS. ROBERT TIPPS 

 education, home life, in­ ternational affairs, pub­ lic affairs and the arts. 

“One major project of the Federation has been 
Girlstown USA,” Mrs. 
Tipps says. “ There are three locations, White­ face, Austin and Borger, for girls without homes. 
They are not law­ breakers. Their worst of­ fense is often running away from home. 

“The Marshall Coopers run Girlstown and have helped trem endously with slides, material and information and speaking engagements. 
“ Some clubs send 

C hristm as gifts, some hold showers, some give funds and others send school supplies or shoes. 
My district has set up an endowment fund and the interest is used for the girls’ needs.” 
Another big program is the “ Hands Up” project started last year. This 
Crime Prevention project is being backed by most member clubs. . 
San Antonio Federation was written up national­ ly last year on an out­ standing Juvenile Anti- 
Shoplifting P rogram . 
Judge Carol Haberman was president at the time. 
“ Our idea in ‘Hands 
Up’ is to get everyone involved in crim e p re ­ v ention,’’ Mrs. Tipps says. “ Scouts and other groups are encouraged to join in Operation ID pro­ grams. The public is en­ couraged to play the role of good neighbor and to keep an eye on their neighbor’s property." 
Cleo Pierce of Gorden, 
Tex., is the state chair­ man for Hands Up and many states are checking with her for details of an outstanding state pro­ gram. 
Operation Share is an­ other big undertaking of 
TFWC. Clubwomen are helping children with learning disabilities. 

Encouraging art appreciation TFWC has an Affiliated Artist Pro­ gram. At the state meet in Dallas, April 26-28, a resident artist will be featured. 
TFWC has their head­ quarters in Austin. "With the new tax break. 5o1-C, we hope that tax money saved can be put to use to benefit our program s,” 
Mrs. Tipps says. 
“ Being president means attending 14 dis­ trict meetings within two years and keeping the com m unication lines open,” she adds. 
“One of my objectives was to improve our state magazine. ‘Texas Club­ woman.’ so that it can be an exchange of ideas. 
There is also a national magazine, 
‘General 
Federation Clubwoman 
News,’ and locally you have the ‘Alamo Gram.’ put out by Carol Silv us 

"I’m proud of the many accomplishments of the clubs I represent and feel that the world is a much better place because of all the volunteer hours and talent they give. 
“ But from a strictly personal view. I’d say the greatest thing about be­ ing president of TFWC is the hundreds of friends 
I’ve made throughout the state."

A series ol Kitcnen 
Workshops will be given in Joske’s stores Thurs­ day and Friday. 
G W. “ Bill” Orr, now 
65 and chairman of the board for the Osier 
Corporation, is traveling to stores throughout the country to demonstrate the company’s small ap­ pliances. 
His philosophy is that his company should not only manufacture and sell quality kitchen ap­ pliances but also should see that the consumer understands how to use the products in the home. 
That’s why he will be presenting one-hour sessions-— slicing and shredding food, telling stories and passing along tips on how to save time, energy and money in food preparation. 

During each session, he will feature the new Kit­ chen Center Foodcrafter 
— a complete all-in-one food processor that slices, shreds, grates, blends, mixes and grinds. 
Kitchen 
Workshops will be held at 11:3o a.m. and I p.m. Thursday in the third-floor house­ wares area at Joske’s 
Alamo Plaza and at 1o:3o a.m. 
Friday in the lower-level housewares area at Joske’s Windsor 
Park. 
The final sessions will be held at I p.m. and 2:3o p.m. 
Friday in the lower-level housewares area at Joske’s North 
Star. 
Reservations are not necessary, but seating at each session will be li­ mited.

Wife learns that father knew best 

Dear Ann: I married a guy HI years my senior when I was HI. Bill was handsome, a smooth talker and my first ser­ ious love affair. 
My parents didn’t like him because In* showed up intoxicated a few times and said some things that weren’t true. 
Of course the more they talked against Bill, the more determined I was to prove them wrong. 
When my father came home with a complete report from a private in­ vestigator. I learned Bill had been married and had a son. 
Ile admitted it, claimed he vs as afraid to tell me for fear he'd lost* me. We eloped the next night. 
My life has been plum hell ever since. We have two small children. My

Smoking 

Dear Ann Landers: 
Our neighbors caught their 13-year-old son smoking. They told him, 
“ lf you want to smoke we'd rather you do it iii front of us than behind our bucks.’’ They rea­ soned if the boy was per­ mitted lo smoke, he’d overdo it, get sick. and quit forever. 
Well, he didn’t get sick and he's not quitting. It s revolting to see this young punk puffing away m front of his friends. 
Now our son (age 14) wants to know why 11K can't smoke. We need help.

Frustration grows for setting Suns 

How dot's a team sag to victory. I ne 
Spurs drew their defense in closer to the basket, thus curtailing the Suns inside game. 
And the result was Sun Antonio s 
25th home victory in 32 attempts. 
The Spurs are now 37-28. 212 games behind Washington, leaders of the 
Central Division, and one game behind second-place Houston 
The Spurs came out in their 3o 
(pressure) defense, and the Suns went backdoor more often than the m ilk­ man. compiling a 3o-25 lead after the opening 12 minutes. 
Then the Spurs, but not their tor- tunes, began to sag. 
“ Phoenix just picked us apart when we were in the 3o.“ said Spurs Coach 
Dong Moe. “ We seemed to be a step behind

On the walls of the Burbank gym are symbols of basketball success, orange balls with black lettering all stressing one theme 
— defense. 
Of all the school's accomplishments the last lour years (state tournament trip this week, two bidistriet titles, three bidistrict championships), Coach 
Earl Mover is proudest of the B u ll­ dogs defensive achievements.

“ Bull. Duke is your hest bet.” insists another. 
" F S C

Texas ... go out-oi-state...” 
How in the world eau a teenager handle such pressure? How can he continue to earn Ii-pl us grades iii hon­ or courses? How can he concentrate on helping Burbank march toward the stale championship? 
Amazingly, Salinas has been able to ignore most of the pressure. ( ouch 
Meyer deserves a lot of credit because he has acted as a screen between Sa­ linas and the hungry recruiters.

MacLeod maintained. “ We are just not playing as hard as we can. We are making it too easy for the offense.” 
And, like the game against the 

Spurs, the Suns have been close during this fruitless stretch. They have lost by four points to Boston and three points to Houston 
“ We got beat in the last 1H seconds against Detroit,” MacLeod recalled, sorrowfully. “ We lost to Buffalo in the 

 last seven seconds and we lost ut overtime to Chicago;

 were scouted by some of the top coaches in the country, simply because they were here scouting Gilbert. 
“ Several times I suggested to the coaches that they go watch another game to scout another kid." 
And it’s helped Meyer as a coach because he has spent hours talking basketball philosophy with the best brains in the business. "Basketball 

 may seem like a simple game but it s complicated in that you never learn all of it,” he explains. “ UCLA and Indiana are totally different in philosophies but they are both successful. It's always good to learn how other people oper­ ate.” 
But for the time being, Earl Meyer must take a break from the philosophy sessions with eager recruiters, lie’s concerned only with how his Bulldogs operate in Austin this weekend. 

This season has been quite a ... bummer for last year’s Sunderelia 
Suns, finalists in the NBA playoffs just one spring ago. 
But injuries have taken away th» starting forward tandem of Gar Heard and Curtis Perry. Heard is out for the year with a stress fracture of the lower right shin and Perry is in traction for his lower back. He, too, is out for the season. 
And the uniformed troops sound like a list of walking wounded. Five players were competing with various ma­ ladies. Even the trainer has torn knee cartilage. The Suns may enlist Ben 
Casey as another assistant coach. 
“ You do not like to blame things on injuries, but we are missing our start­ ing fo r w a r d s .” said Paul YVestphal.

All it takes is money. 
Plus compensation. 
Those five stars are among some 54 National 
Basketball Association players who are unsigned for next season.accord­ ing to a survey of teams conducted by the New 
York Daily News. 
They will be eligible to negotiate with any team in the league once the playoffs end. 
However, even though the option clause is a thing of the past thanks to last summer’s agree­ ment between the NBA and the players associa­ tion. few players are ex­ pected to switch teams iii the offseason. 
Under terms of the* agreement, the players will not become true free agents until 198o. 
Until then, any team signing one of the availa­ ble players must com­ pensate his former team with cash, draft choices or other players. 
Ii the two teams can’t agree on compensation. 
NBA 
Commissioner 
Larry O’Brien will make the decision. 
II that sounds like pro football’s old Itozelle 
Rule, it is. 
“ The idea of compen­ sation is to make whole the team that lost the player, but the award cannot be so high as to constitute a penalty on the team that acquires a player," explained 
Deputy Commissioner 
Simon Gourdine. 

Not easy 

O’Brien is not looking forward to the task “ It’s not going to he easy," he said. " I may need the wisdom of Solomon, plus a crystal ball. to make some of those judgments us to what a player is worth.” 
This is the first full year of the agreement, so not much movement is expected. 
The Atlanta Hawks are reportedly close to sign­ ing Robinson, and the 
New York Knicks are not about to let McAdoo gel away— not after spend­ ing $3 million to obtain hun from Buffalo. 
Maravich, the NBA s leading scorer, is an un­ usual situation. He says his contractual obliga­ tions will be fulfilled at the end of this season, but the New Orleans Jazz feel he owes them another year. In any case, Maravich says he doesn’t want to ieave 
New Orleans—hut does want to play with a win­ ner. 
Wilkes is another spe­ cial case. He is thinking of going to law school or pursuing an acting car­ eer. But.if he stays in basketball, it almost cer­ tainly will be with Golden 
Slate. 
There ale also some players who have an­ nounced plans lo retire at the end of this season, such as Bill Bradley of the Knicks and Jack 
Marin of Chicago.

Kenon, “ but I ’m not used to playing with my back to the basket.” 
Kenon moved continually on offense, thus freeing himslef for a lot of close shots. 
“ In the first half we were dead,” said K. “ I knew we needed some pep in the second half. And the way to do that is get a lot of movement. 
“ That’s the way we make things happen.” 
“ They picked us blind when we were in the 3o,” said Gervin, who sank 13 of 
14 shots from the free throw line. “ So we used the IO. 
“ That caused Phoenix to shoot from the perimeter, and that's the weaker part of their game.” 
“ It’s tough coming home after win­ ning four straight on the road,” said 
Moe. “ It was a good effort.” 

Barker beats 
Forood, 6*2, 6-2 

DALLAS (A P) — Second-seeded Sue 
Barker kept her momentum rolling 
Tuesday in the wake of her first tour­ nament victory of the year and won an opeening-round match in a $1oo,ooo women’s pro tennis tournament. 
Miss Barker, the 2o-year-old blonde from Paignton, England, rolled over 
Stanford University's Lele Forood 6-2, 
6-2,. Two days earlier, she won the tour event at San Francisco. 

Westphal and Sobers paced Phoenix with 24 points each, while Alvan 
Adams and Ira Terrell had 21 and 2o, respectively. . 
But it was Dampier who was inter­ viewed afterwards on the Suns’ tele­ vision network, and he received a din­ ner for two from a Phoenix restaurant . 
“ I guess this means ITI have to play another year,” Dampier smil

Continued from Page IC in a zone and that carries over when you have the ball.” 
.Among the Burbank players, junior forward 
Steve Gamboa is vastly underrated because his defense goes too unno­ ticed 
“ Gilbert (.Salinas) does it on size,” Meyer says. 
“ but Steve does it on quickness. 
“ He always has the toughest assignment after Salinas has the No. 
I priority inside. His job is to stop their main player and he’s guarded such players like E d ­ monson (K eith), Bean 
(Charles), Cloman (Der­ ick), Pollock David) and 
Medina (Freddy). 
“ You put his whole game together and he’s about like a 3o-point man to us.” 
Gamboa himself says, 
“ If you’re not as tall 
(he’s six foot), you’ve got to rely on quick reac­ tions. 
“ We also helped out more inside and sagged more the times Gilbert wasn’t in. 
“ Most of it is funda­ mentals, although you have to remember to get back quickly on defense in case the other team

“ Coach gets you really prepared,” 
Lam bert said, “ and defense is mostly a matter of get­ ting mentally prepared.” 
“ Some other things, that have helped us these last few games is block­ ing out, keeping them off the boards and stopping fastbreaks. 
“ I'm in the same spot I was last year, but start­ ing the game off is a lot different because you get your mind into what’s happening much more quickly,” added Leon­ ard, who came to B u r­ bank from San Angelo as a freshman.

Camp, Travel Show doors open at 5p.m . 

Doors to the fifth annual 
Camping and Travel Show at the 
Convention Center open at 5 p.m. today, but the Exhibit Hall won’t look exactly like Tent Ci­ ty. 
In fact. there probably won’t be a tent in the place unless the Campers and Hikers Association has one on dis­ play. 
Most of the “ camping” units which will be spread out over the display area in the Exhibit Hall will be on wheels. 
They’ll include pop-up tent trailers, pickup campers, motor homes, travel trailers and van conversions. 

The Convention Center will be a good place for the potential buyer to check over a wide variety of recreational ve­ hicle types, brands and interior d e­ signs, plus accessories for RVs. 

For example, some of the new ac­ cessories this year include a combina­ tion air-conditioning/heating unit for 
RVs and electric jacks on motor homes which are used to level the homes when the overnight site is reached. 
There’ll probably be a lot of interest in accessories for the newest'addition to the RV line, the van conversion. On exhibit will be paneling kits, fiberglass extension tops, sleeping quarter con­ versions and tire carriers for the vans. 
The show will run five days, through 
Sunday. Hours today through Friday are 5 to IO p.m. Hours Saturday will be 
I to IO p.m. and. Sunday, I to 7 p.m. 
Tickets are $2. Children 6 to 12 will admitted for 5o cents. 

Regulatory game hearings 

The Parks and Wildlife Department will hold hearings on proposed game and fish regulations in regulatory counties later this month. 
The hearings are designed to allow interested hunters, fishermen and lan­ downers to discuss proposed regula­ tions before they are passed on by commissioners. 
Reports on comments from the pub­ lic are forwarded to the commission. 
Commissioners are scheduled to meet 
April 14*15 to set regulations on native game animals for the coming season. 

The public hearing for Bexar County is scheduled March 23 at IO a.m. in the 
National Guard Armory, 311 East Ar­ senal. 

Dates and sites of hearings in counties in the immediate area are:

Snakes 

SPECIAL TO THC EXPRESS 

WACO - St. Mary’s pitchers had a hard time finding the plate as the 
Baylor Bears swept the 
Rattlers, 15-8 and 11-5, 
Tuesday afternoon. 
St. Mary’s hurlers al­ lowed 25 walks and 19 hits in the twin bill. 
The Bears scored 12 runs in the fourth inning of the first game, largely with the help of nine walks and two singles and three runs batted in by Steve Macko. Catcher 
Steve Czimsky hit a solo home run for the Bears. 
Macko hit a three-run homer and 
Leonard 
Wade added a two-run shot for the Bears in the second game, which fea­ tured 14 Rattler walks. 
Charlie Migl cracked a three-run roundtripper for St. Mary’s.

SAN ANTO NIO EXPRESS— Wednesday March 9 1977 
Pan Ant’s miracle worker 

Evangelist Oral Roberts, who has performed a few miracles in his day, must have had the help of Divine Providence when he picked Bill White to initiate the first basketball program at Oral 
Roberts University in Tulsa. 

Whitt* accepted Roberts' oiler in 1965 and when he departed for the Univer­ sity of Corpus Christi after four sea­ sons he had established the OKU pro­ gram w ith a good base. His record was 
65-35. 
Pan American University called on 
White to perform another miracle this season. 
The Broncs needed some quick healing and the job required more than faith. 
Empty 
When Abe Lemons departed for the 
University of Texas, he practically left the PAU stockpile empty. 
White was promoted to the top job, but did not have a starter back from last season's 22-5 team. Among the missing was Marshall Rogers, the top scorer in the nation in NCAA Division 
I. 
But White picked up the scraps, tossed them into a melting pot and stirred away. 
The Broncs completed their first season under White last week with a 
17-9 record by beating North Texas 
State, 86-72, at the SuperPit in Denton, a rare happening in itself 
Pan Ani handed NTSC two of its de­ feats in a 21-6 campaign 
When White was elevated to the top rung. it was already late in the re­ cruiting season. But he brought in a 

C ollege S cen e 

 wit Ii m i l o r d B ro y le s 

 half dozen junior college transfers from a half dozen different junior col­ lege backgrounds, one freshman and a single walk-on. 
All of Pan American’s holdovers from last season were letterman, and only three, Billy Bolts, Jim Ed Holland and Cris Garcia, played prominent roles off the bench. 
In fact, Arnold “ Pizza” Vera, who played only 48 minutes this season, was the lone Bronc with more than a year's varsity experience. 
Nonetheless, when White put all the parts together, his contraption worked. 
Top scorers 
Pan Ain s top three scorers were junior college transfers and the top five Bronc point makers averaged in double figures. Those five scored 2,o11 of Pan American’s 2,182 points. 
White used an iron-man lineup most of the way with six players doing most of the work. Holland was the only re­ serve to put in more than 15o minutes of playing time during the year. 
Michael Edwards, who played a year ago at Weatherford JC, led Pan Am scorers with 2o.3 points a game. Henry 
Taylor, a transfer from South Plains 
JC in Levelland, netted 19.2 points a 

 game and was the team’s leading re­ bounder. 
At 6-7 Randy Woods, from Northern 
Iowa JC. was the club’s tallest player and playmaking guard John Wilbanks’ averaged just under 12 assists a game 
(311 in 26 games). 
Notes 
Now a few notes from elsewhere in the sports world. 
St. M ary’s senior Bobby Reid is contemplating a career with Athletes in Action, a touring basketball team sponsored by the Campus Crusade for 
Christ. 
AIA flew Reid to Long Beach, Calif., for Monday night’s game with the So­ viet Red Army team and the Rattler 
All-American is taking a serious look at the AIA as well as awaiting the out­ come of the NBA draft. AIA had its 
26-game winning streak snapped by the Soviets. 
Briley in action 
S.A.’s Olympic diver, Melissa Bri­ ley, will be competing this week for the 
U.S. in a dual meet with the Russians in Minsk. It will be a busy month for the Miami, Fla., junior. Briley will compete March 17-19 at the AIAW swimming and diving championships

Coogs play ISI 

HOUSTON (AP) — The University of Houston basketball team, with high scoring Otis Birdsong, and Indiana State, with higher scoring Larry Bird, meet Wednesday night at 
Hofheinz Pavilion in the first round of the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
The NIT. oldest post season college basketball tournament in the United States, changed its format this year by scheduling the first round of the 16-team tournament outside 
New York. 
First round winners advance to New York’s Madison 
Square Garden for quarterfinal games March 14-15. Semi­ finals are scheduled March 17 and the title match on March 
2o. 

 in Providence, R .I., and March 
3o-April 2 at the AAU national cham­ pionships at the University of Texas' new complex in Austin. 
Dr. Allen D. Heilman, chairman of 
Southwest Texas State’s Department of 
Geography and a top swimmer in the 
San Marcos Aquatic Club, will be hon­ ored Sunday as one of South Texas’ outstanding athletes at the AAU’s an­ nual bunquet at the Hilton Palaeio Del 
Rio. lleliman ranks in the top ten swimmers nationally in five back­ stroke events and the 5o-yard freestyle in the 55-59 age group. 
AAU tourney 
The Howard Payne basketball team, ousted from the NAIA playoffs by St. 
Mary’s, has been invited to participate in the AAU regional tourney. Mar. 
18-2o, at Wichita, Kan. One of the top 
NAIA teams, which fails to qualify for the national tournament-, is selected to represent the NAIA annually. St. 
Mary’s represented the NAIA a year ago and this will be Howard Payne's third time in the AAU event. 
Quickie quiz ... What was the last 
Texas team to win the 
NAIA 
Tournament? That would be Pan 
American in 1963 and the team was led by former pro star Luke Jackson. The last Lone Star Conference winner was 
Southwest Texas in 196o. 
Texas A&I and former Edison foot­ baller Larry Collins put on the gloves recently and fought in the regional 
Golden Gloves in Corpus Christi. It was his first attempt at boxing since his high school days and the Golden 
Gloves in S. A. Listed as a hea­ vyweight, Collins won his first bout, then defaulted, but said, “I ’m still go­ ing to fight. Next year I’m going'to be the champion of the Golden Gloves.”

American Security Life Insurance Co.’s net in­ com e for 1976 was a record $1,964,492, President R. 
B. Sunderland announced Tuesday. 
The announcement was m ade at the stockholders’ annual m eeting in San Antonio.

The net incom e w as based on total sa les of

$7o4,658,959. 
Sunderland also announced officer promotions at the m eeting 
They were G R. Ferdinandsten to senior vice president of operations; Floyd D Mason to senior vice president, actuary; Lee Page, to senior vice president of m arketing, and Mrs. Muriel Wolfe to assistant vice president of accounting. 
A cash dividend of 15 per cent of the par value of

GENEVA, Switzerland (A P) — The value of world trade rose 12 per cent from 1975 to 1976 to a record $989 . billion, the G eneral A greem ent on 
Tariffs and Trade GATT estim ated 
Tuesday. 

Last year, trade volume was ll per cent above its depressed 1975 levels 

 and up 4 per cent from the previous peak in 1974 
And GATT said trade would continue to grow this year, although at a slower rate. 

The world trade organization said several leading nations have given indications the pace of econom ic reco­ very, which slackened for most of 1976,

AUSTIN, Tex. (A P) — 
A bill that would exempt 
T exas new spaper sa le s from the sales tax, both street and by su b scrip ­ tion, was passed by the 
Texas Senate Tuesday on voice vote. 

The m easure also ex ­ em p ts T exas published magazines from a tax on subscriptions. 

Three senators asked to be recorded as voting a g a in st the m ea su re. 
T hey w ere S en s. B ill 
Moore, D-Bryan, Oscar 
Mauzy, D-Dallas, and Ike 
Harris, R-Dallas. 
There was no debate on the measure. 
A L egislative B udget 
Board report presented w ith the 
S en ate b ill estim ated the m easure 

 would result in a general revenue loss of about $5.2 million and a local sales tax loss of $1 m illion in 
1978 and of $5 7 m illion sta te and $1.2 m illio n local in 1979

 may be picking up again 
But GATT warned trade s growth this year would be slower than in 1976 in part because the restocking which contributed to last year’s gains ap­ pears to have been com pleted. GATT also said import demand in the oil-im ­ porting developing countries, southern and eastern Europe, Russia and the 
Far East continues to be restrained because of paym ents deficits. 
According to GATT, major factors affecting world trade in 1977 w ill in­ clude: 
• 
The accelerated rise in costs of food and industrial raw m aterials. 
GATT said the in crea ses threaten p rogress m ade in sta b iliza tio n of prices. But it said as long as leading countries stick to policies of moderate monetary expansion, the com m odity price in crea ses won t spark w id es­ pread fears of a renewed sharp infla­ tion 
• 
New capital investm ents, which have been inhibited by below-average rates of return and excessive uncer­ tainty about inflation and prices of energy sources. GATT said lower in­ 

 flation rates have helped restore busi­ n ess co n fid e n c e.

Clayton Burkstrand, president of Globe, said: 

“ Nowhere can shoppers find higher quality m e r­ chandise at consistently everyday low prices than at 
Globe. 

“ San Antonio is another milestone in our expansion of the G lobe chain. We are proud of our total of 39 stores throughout Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico and 
Arizona. 

“ Selection of the San Antonio m arket as key to the expansion came as a result of very careful market studies and analysis of the city's progressiveness and growth that in recent years have formed an ideal economic atmosphere for business and industry.” 

Van Horn pointed out that the new stores’ manage­ ment team offers in excess of 79 years of manage­ ment and retail experience. Said Van Horn: 

“They are all dedicated professionals who see to it that the stores bring shoppers all of the best for their special needs. Globe management personnel are not only expert merchandisers but are also family people who understand the need for economy today.” 

The new stores’ management team consists of Jose 
Olguin. store manager. West Commerce Street loca­ tion; Ernest Henson, store manager. Broadway loca­ tion. and Charles Baker, store manager. Fredericks­ burg Road location. 

O perations and m erchandise m anagers at each store are Jam ie Gonzales and Robert Nieto, West 
Commerce Street store; Gloria Alajandro and Jose 
M ontem ayor at the Broadway store and Porfirio 
Gonzalez and John Caldwell at the Fredericksburg 
Road Store. 

Every facet of the Globe operation is pleasing to the shopper from the wide selection of quality merchan-

 disc to the low prices to the courteous sales personnel and the company’s policy of fast, friendly refunds. 

In each Globe store there is a courtesy booth where refund service is provided. Should a customer ever be dissatisfied for any reason with bis purchase, the merchandise can be returned to Globe for either a speedy exchange or refund. The only requirement is that the return merchandise be accompanied by the sales slip. A fast, friendly refund may be a thing of the past in many modern stores, but that is not true at any 
Globe store.

Army boss boosted biological program 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense Secretary Harold 
Brown played a significant role in expandin g the biological and chemical warfare program s in 1961, an Army report showed Tuesday.- 
The report said Brown, then the P en ta g o n ’s re­ search and development chief, “ strongly concurred in the JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) view that these weapons had great potential.” 
However, tile report ad d e d , Brown “ felt they could be considered operational only in the most limited sense and that the task of m easuring their impact accurately still had to be done.’’ 
The r e p o rt, t r a c i n g U.S. b io lo g i c a l w e a p o n s development from 1942 to 1969 when the pro g am ended, also mentions a lesser role by Secretary of 
State Cyrus Vance in 1982 when he was secretary of the Army. 
It said that Vance on Aug. 21, 1962, “ provided r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s with s u p p o r t i n g d e t a i l e d r a ­ tionale” for a biological and chemical weapons test at the Arm y’s Deseret Test Center.

1o-story building with the body of a friend ut lier feet. When she h e a r d bulldozers outside, she thought it was the end. 
“ I w as a f r a id th ey wouldn’t hear me calling aud would kill m e," the 
45-year-old waitress said 
Tuesday .from her hospi­ tal bed. 
Instead, she was freed

Iordache’s calls and tap­ ping. and reportedly led by P r e s i d e n t N icolae 
Ceausescu, carefully lift­ ed off the timbers, bricks and tangled wires until they reached her. 
Mrs. Iordache was one of several Bucharest re­ s i d e n t s found alive as t e a m s of s o l d i e r s , policemen and workers, some aided by specially trained dogs, continued to sift through the ruins of m ore th an 3o a p a r t ­ ment houses collapsed by the 2o-minute quake. 
1,o34 dead 

The official death toll stood at 1,o34 Tuesday, including 81o in Buchar­ est, and m o r e bod ies were continuously being brought to the morgue. 
Western diplom ats said the toll could reach 4.ooo and other estimates put the figure even higher.

Climate may help arthritis 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: My mother, 48, has had rheumatoid arthritis for several years. 
It seem s that when the climate changes her limbs ache. She also gets sore throats and fever, but gets well with antibiotics. Is there any connection between the climate here and her problem? — M.R. 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: I have arthritis really bad. 
Will it help if I move to a warmer climateo — Mrs 
TO. 
This question pops up frequently in my mail I can tell both of you that there is no established connection between cli­ mate and rheum atoid arthritis. It occurs in all areas of the country and world and is fundamen­ tally the same wherever it occurs. • 
Coldness and dam p­ ness can cause pain and stiffness in many peo­ ple, whether they have arth ritis or not. Vet, there is no question that symptoms of arthritis may be worse in less pleasant climates. 
But living is generally easier in warmer areas. 
For the arthritic there may be more motivation to go outdoors and take a walk in the sunshine. 
Exercise helps arthritis wherever one lives. (Both writers live in areas of severe winters and brief summers.) 
M.R.’s mother seems prone to infections. Any illness will worsen arthritis symptoms. An attempt should be made to trace the cause of her recurrent sore throats and fevers. In some cases, antibiotics can make matters worse for the arthritic. 
Won’t help 
I doubt that a move would help matters for either 
M.R.’s mother or for Mrs. T.O. It certainly will not, as I mentioned, alter the course of the disease or eliminate the need for therapy and control. 
Some have made such moves and found improve­ ment. Others have found none, and some have seen a worsening. Some reports of improvement can be attributed to a natural easing of symptoms, which might have occurred even had they stayed where they were. 

Arthritis sufferers con be helped. Dr. T h o ste so n '* b ooklet discusses mony types of arthritis and related joint diseases as well os effective treatments and medications. For a copy of "H o w You 
Can Control Arthritis," write to him in care of this new spaper.

If you write to a star, will they receive the let­ ter personally? —L.R. 

If you’re talking about a big star, the answer is most likely no. Big stars get a tremendous volume of mail which is general­ ly handled by a fan mail or a secretarial service. 
However, there are well-known actors who aren’t in the heavy mail category. Generally they receive their mail and most of them read it and quite a few of them answer it.

Traveler’s checks 

While my wilt* was selecting groceries at a North 
Side store, part of a larger chain, I tried to cash a traveler's check at the office. 
The manager, or employe, was busy tabulating a stack of personal checks. He told me it was a company policy to reject all money orders. 
This was a surprise to me because several other stores in town accept those checks. I wonder if the store knows how much business it is losing by not accepting these checks. 
I went to a liquor store next door and had no trouble cashing it. 
These checks are issued by the Republic National 
Bank of Dallas. We used them in Honolulu, Hawaii and aboard ship while on a Carribean cruise. 
This store has been the only objector. Some of the 
Express readers might be glad to find out about this policy. 

I. R. 

^TfeWEiER's 
CHECKI j 

“ This is not a bank,” 

 the store manager said. 
“ We are a grocery 

 store.” 
“ The store managers 

 d i d not set the policy,” he said. " It was set by the company at least IO years ago.” 
The manager said tra­ veler’s checks were often stolen. “ And the thief usually steals identifica­ tion with the checks,” he said. 
"W e don’t want to take 

 any more chances of cashing hot checks,” he added. 
The store’s policy is 

 posted at every cash re­ gister. the window of the manager’s office and at all in and out doors. 
The signs says, " P e r ­ 

 sonal checks for the amount of purchase only. 
No two-party checks. No out-of-town checks. Iden­ tification must be pre­ sented. Payroll checks accepted from regular shoppers only. 
Store 

 manager must approve all checks. No traveler’s checks. 
No money 

 orders.” 

The manager said he 

 was aware this presented problems for some 

 customers, but he added this had been the policy for some time and he had not noticed any decrease in the number of shop­ pers. 

Ile also said the 

 number of hot checks had decreased.

Great Decisions 

I am responding to L. E. P.’s inquiry of March I concerning National Public Radio and the Great 
Decisions ’77 program. 

The Great Decisions series, a program of the 
Foreign Policy Assn. of New York, covering eight foreign policy topics has been carried for the past five or six years by KKYX radio and KLRN-TV. 

The radio programs were produced by W ayne State 
University and the television series by the Univer­ sity of Georgia. 

Unfortunately, because of funding difficulties, these excellent programs were not produced this year. 

The League of Women Voters has acted as local sponsor for the past six years and is doing so again this year. 
There are two discussion groups that meet in 
X.

Law officials to descend on San Diego for meet 

State, federal and Mexican law en­ forcement officials will gather in San 
Diego, ( ’alif., in April to discuss border-related problems. 
Agenda for the meeting includes talks on a full range of criminal problems, including stolen property, narcotics and smuggling. Mary .Jane 
Bode said Tuesday. 
Mrs. Bode is a spokesman for Texas 
Atty. Gen. John Hill, who is coordin­ ating the meeting with California Atty, 
Gen. Evelle J. Younger, 
She said U.S. Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell agreed Monday to attend the meeting. 
Hill is planning a trip to Mexico City to invite the Mexican federal attorney general. 
Arizona Atty. Gen. Bruce Babbitt and Atty. Gen. Tony Anaya of New 

Mexico also are planning to partici­ pate. 
The meeting will be April 21-24 — the same dates as the annual meeting of the Border Cities Mayor Assn. in 
Tijuana. Mex., Mrs. Bode said. 
Tijuana is directly across the border from San Diego. 

■ A tentative agenda for the meeting includes discussions on the prisoner swap treaty, organized border crimin­ al activity and crime in border cities, she said. 

Also to bi* discussed is cooperation between state, federal and Mexican law enforcement agencies. 
The meeting is the first for the four state attorneys general, Mrs. Bode said. 

 shall Formby of Plain­ view dissented in the board's 1o-2 vote. 
Several board members acknowledged that there is a shortage of physicians in the pover­ ty-stricken regions of 
South Texas, but said they didn’t feel another medical school would keep doctors from mi­ grating to large cities. 
TWU’s proposal called for the creation of a medical school empha­ sizing the training of family practice phy­ sicians. TWU officials said the school was aimed at providing more doctors for the area. 
The board, however, apparently left the door slightly ajar by estab­ lishing as their top prio­ rity a committee to study ways of keeping doctors in rural areas. 
Answer 
“ The answer to that problem (doctor shor­ tage) is not the creation of another medical school,’’ said board member Paul Teague of 
Texas City. “ I don’t think ifs a matter for the coordinating board to handle.” 
Teague also cited the lack of a “ adequate primary teaching hospi­ tal” in South Texas, say­ ing, “ That means the state will have to build another major teaching hospital. . .this time in the Valley.” 
Board member Harold 
Herndon of San Antonio said attempting to estab­ lish a medical school without a teaching hospi­ tal would create “ a tur­ moil’’ in South Texas. 
"If I thought creating another medical school would alleviate the prob­ lem. . .I don’t care what the cost. I d vote for it,” said board member 
Newton 
Gresham of 

Houston. "But this would not solve the problem.” 
Formby disagreed. "It seems to me that if you put enough medical schools in the state, you’ll have enough doc­ tors.” 
"The board has applied a double standard on oc­ casion,’’ argued Bonilla. 
He was referring to the board’s action Tuesday that removed the final obslable to a Texas A&M 
College of Medicine. The board, in effect, officially 

 changed the A&M school from a. “ program of medicine’’ to full college. 
Bonilla said the school is needed to provide for more minority and women medical students and to keep 
Texas students from leaving the country if there aren’t enough places in Texas schools. 
"We should take care of our own," said Bonilla. 
“ The lives and needs of the people far outweigh the money involved." 
Missing Texas soldier found 

FT. ORD, Calif. (A P) 
— A 27-year-old Army officer, missing for more than a week, was report­ ed found along a road ly­ ing face down and numb from the cold just outside 
Ft. Ord early Tuesday. 
First Ut. Don Patterson said, “ I v e been kid­ napped,” according to 
George Ritchie, the Mon­ terey County game war­ den who found the miss­ ing soldier while return­ ing from an early morn­ ing check of illegal pig hunters. 
Patterson, a native of 
Blooming Grove, Tex., had been missing since 
Feb. 28. 
Hospital 
After Ritchie found the soldier, authorities took 
Patterson to an Army hospital. He was released after two hours and FBI agents questioned him about the missing week. 
Army authorities had received a note threaten­ ing harm to Patterson "if the United States doesn’t admit to its faults by be­ ing in Vietnam," the FBI said. 
The game warden's wife said, “ My husband 

 feared it was some kind of a trap or set up, but he stopped anyway. 
He found this man freezing cold and face down.” 
Patterson left his 
Salinas home for a movie 
Feb. 28. His ear. with the keys in the ingnition, was found at Et. Ord the next day. 
The F B I would not comment immediately on the investigation and the validity of Patter­ son's charges or the treatening note.

B ill giving public CPS control gets sidetracked 

EXPRESS CAPITOL BUREAU 

A bill which State 
AUSTIN 
Hep. Joe Hernandez says will give control of San Antonio’s public utility system back to the people was detoured to a House subcommittee 
Tuesday. 

HB375 spo n so red by H ernand ez 
District court still has no hom e 

The fourth new district court still doesn't have a home under the Bexar County Courthouse roof. 
To find a place for it. Commissioners 
Court has gone as far afield as the post office building on Alamo Plaza where there is now a large usable courtroom vacated by the federal courts when they moved into a new building. 
According to Com. Jeff Wentworth, federal officials have made the space available if the county wishes to use it. 
Several judges, particularly 16oth 
District Judge Peter Michael Curry, object vehemently to removal of any of the courts — new or old — from Bexar 
County Courthouse 
Other judges Tuesday, however, took aim at the Commissioners’ Court jug­ gling plan that calls for trimming the size of the existing central jury room to make way for a fourth court. 
More jurors 

With the new courts, more jurors will be culled and the space is needed there, they argued . 
Jud ge Blair Reeves, the co m m is­ sioners and other county officials met informally with several district judges to review space plans Tuesday m orn­ ing. 
They aired new ideas for shifting some current courthouse tenants to quarters in other buildings and thus make space for the new courts. 
The Roads Department is one that might be moved to allow court space expansion. Judge Reeves agreed. 
175th District Court Judge Preston 
Dial and 186th District Court Judge 
•lames E. Barlow both favor use of the vacant federal courtroom in the Alamo 
Plaza building. 

Expansion plans 

They felt a temporary move would allow the courts to go to work and yet provide tijne to work out new con­ struction and expansion plans There is still talk ot building a new 2o-story county building on adjacent property, they pointed out. 

Com. Tom Stolhandske agreed the temporary option could allow proper planning for future needs also. 

No decision on the space problem was made, however. 

 would call for the San Antonio City 
Council to select the members of the 
City Public Service hoard. The board is currently self-perpetuating, choos­ ing its own members. 
The bill was debated before the In­ tergovernmental Affairs Committee, but the lack of one vote prevented the bill from moving on to the full House with a recom m endation that it be passed. 

Instead, the bill was referred to the urban affairs subcom m ittee for an­ other try next week. 
Even so, Hernandez predicted his bill would make it out of committee easily and eventually be passed by the 
House and sent to the Senate. 
“This is one of the most important bills this session for us,- Hernandez said after the committee's action. 
“ It’ll give the people through the city 

 council a direct vote on the m em ber­ ship of the City Public Service board,” he said. 
On the other hand, if such a bill is passed by the legislature. CPS tru s­ teeship would fight it out in court. CPS attorney Stuart Schooler told the com­ mittee. 
“ I've been told verbally by the trust company if any attem pt is m ade to change the management position, suit will be filed . . .” Schooler said 
Schooler said CPS m a n a g e m e n t views Hernandez’ bill as an attempt to involve politics in the selection of CPS board members. 
' Appointments m ade on a political basis is forbidden under both the ori­ ginal and revised tru st in dentures which govern the operation and fin­ ancing of CPS. 
Schooler also argued fu rth e r c h an g es in the b o a rd ’s selection procedures would hurt the utility’s bond rating. 
After a revision of the indenture last year to include the m ayo r or his designate as a voting m em ber of the board. Schooler said the utility sys­ tem ’s bond rating dropped from AAA to AA. 
The revision of the indenture also gave the city council veto power over new m em bers nominated to succeed other board members. 
However, Hernandez said the coun­ cil’s veto power is not enough to insure true representation on the board from the overall population in San Antonio. 
H ernand ez said his bill has the backing of at least nine m em bers of the Bexar County House delegation. 
Testifying before the committee in behalf of the bill were Reps. Matt 
Garcia and Ron Bird. 
Tin* city of San Antonio also is urg­ ing passage of the bill. said Je rry 
Henekel who represents the city in 
Austin.

EUWD will seek law change 

The Edwards Underground Water 
District decided Tuesday to seek spe­ cific changes in the slate law which had created it in 1959 in order to gain certain powers 
The district board members had last week agreed on the matter, but passed a proposal worded to give them powers given to regular state water districts. 
The EUWD is a specially created district bt protect and maintain the 
Edwards aquifer, the major drinking w ater source for San Antonio and surrounding counties. 
EUWD directors Tuesday decided to seek specific powers rather than all powers normally given waler districts. 
EUWD will submit its law change biti this week to the Texas Legislature. 
Specifically, EUWD wants to import su rface w ater into the five-county district for resale ill order to equitably spread the cost of surface water deve­ lopment. 
Also. EUWD wants authority over the construction and maintenance of wells to insure the wells do rmt allow pollution w hich m ay contaminate aquifer waler.

President Carter s appointm ent of tile form er P entag on official was defended iii Senate debate by a in­ fluential Senate Democrats, including

George McGovern. D-S.D . Edmund S.

D-Mo. 
Senate Majority Whip Alan C ran ­ ston, D-CaliL, told reporters, m ean­ time, that “ we now have 58 firm votes” assuring the confirmation cl Warnke 
Wednesday to head the U.S. delegation to strategic arms limitation talks with the Sov iet Union. 
Baker 

Oil the other side. Republica!. Senate 
Leader Howard ii Baker of Tennessee said “ more than a third” of the Senate will vote against Warlike, placing a question m ark on future Senate r a ­ tification of any new arms limitation agreement resulting from SALT nego­ tiations. 
W arnke has been under fire for numerous statem ents over the past eight years urging defense budget cuts, opposing new weapons systems development, and suggesting tem por­ ary arms restraint by the United States to see if the R ussians would r e c i­ procate. 
Stennis told the Senate that Warnke 
“ has built an image of himself over the years so as to virtually destroy his usefulness as a negotiator ” 

Mr Warnke has been an advocate of certain p osition s relating to our null- 
(ary posture for so long and with such vigor that I believe it weakens his ability lo carry un negotiations and bring brack a treaty that can be ac­ cepted.” Stennis said 

Stennis said the threat to mankind of nuclear weapons is so g re a t that 

“ every possible effort based on reason and common sense” must be made to reach an arms limitation agreement. 
In the end. he said. it will be the P re­ sident who must use his powers of persuasion 

” 1 believe it is P re sid e n t C arter himself who gives us the best chance to get the important results we need in this negotiation,” Stennis said. “ He should not be saddled with questions of past positions of which he has had im­ part ” 
W arnke ulso was opposed iii speeches by Sens. John Tower. R-Tex., and Barry Coldwater, R-Ariz. 
Tower said the paramount issues are 
Warnke’s “ judgment and credibility,” 
Coldwater said W arnke’s appoint­ ment reflects what is becoming “ the dominant position of the Curter ad ­ m inistration — a position of w eak­ ness." 
“ Tins dangerous world in which we live requires jiower. whether we like it or not,’’ C oldw ater said. 

Price o f love is high 

A BB-year-old West Side man recent­ ly found that marriage plans can often be upset by money — lots of it. 
Or ut least, he now knows why his 
22-year-old fiance was interested in him. 
The man told pollee $6,9oo of his money and his young girlfriend have both been missing since Sunday. 
He reportedly took his bride-to-be to dinner Sunday night, visited some of his relatives and then took her home. 
The m an's sister-in-law informed the man that she saw the young woman take something out of the m an's coat pocket Sunday night. 
He said he had $1oo bills in a paper bag stuffed iii one of his coat pockets. 
When he cheeked his coat, he disco­ vered the money was gone. When he cheeked the woman s apartment lie also discovered she was gone — ap­ parently with the money. 
No soliciting, youths told 

San Antonio River Walk Commission members voted Tuesday not to allow a youth group lo collect for the Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. along the River Walk. 
The req u est from 
S h a m ro c k s 
Against Dystrophy was considered at tile commission’s monthly meeting. 
Commissioners said they considered tile NIDA cause worthwhile but they also feared others groups may also ask to solicit donations along the River 
Walk. 
Soliciting would detract from the quiet atmosphere of the tourist attrac­ tion, commissioners said. 
The Shamrocks group already plans to solicit donations for MUA at busy traffic intersections later this month.

A HUNTER clubs a seal pup to death so that it can be skinned 
Battle brews over m urder o f baby seals 

ST. JOHN’S. Canada (AP) — Hunters are leaving for the annual baby seal hunt on Canada's Atlantic* ice fields despite charges of barbarity from conser­ vationists in Canada, Europe and the United States. 
Supporters of the hunt see it as a boon to unem­ ployed fishermen and a traditional part of the area's economy. 
The hunters, mostly from Norway and Canada, search out baby hood and harp seals along the shores of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of St. Law relive and on the Front, the massive ice field off New­ foundland and Labrador where the pups are born. 
The seals, many of them only a few weeks old. are clubbed to death and skinned for their valuable fur. 
The Canadian government describes clubbing as 
"the most humane method for killing the cubs,” while opponents call it cruel and barbarous. 
Thousands of hunters 
The first three sealing ships, carrying a total of 
12U hunters, left St. John’s on Monday. Bv the time the annual harvest of seal pups starts next Tuesday or Wednesday, thousands of hunters are expected to bE> on the scene. 
Canadian hunters, usually fishermen unemployed since autumn, can earn more than $2.(JOU for a few weeks work on the seal hunt. 
As in recent years, several conservation groups, including the Greenpeace Foundation and the In­ ternational Fund for Animal Welfare, — IFAW — have promised to oppose the hunt, w hich begins next week for harp seals and nine days later for the hoods. 
Franz Weber, a Swiss conservationist, has offered to fly several hundred journalists from Europe in hopes they will return home and write against the hunt. Other groups have been careful not to reveal their tactii*s, although IFAW also plans to fly jour­ nalists to the hunt. 
Counter-protest 
The Newfoundland provincial government, which strongly supports the hunt, has given $o,ooo to two local groups who plan to picket the conservationists. 
Seal hunting has been a tradition iii New foundland and Labrador for centuries, and local legends tell of hunters risking their lives in rough seas or treu-, chorous ice in the annual adventure. 
The hunt pumps about $ooo,ooo into the New­ foundland econonly at a time of the year when up to 
9o per cent of the work force is unemployed because bud weather makes fishing impossible. The total value of last year’s kill, including the Norwegian share, amounted to $3.o million, the* governm ent said. 
The F rench ex plo rer J a c q u e s C a rtie r found 
Indians hunting seals off the coast in 1534, and by the 18th century sealing became a mainstay of tin* economies of Labrador and Newfoundland. 
World can stuff it 
“ We're going to fight for our way of life and we're going it* tell the rest of the world to stuff it.” said 
Richard la s h in , president of the Newfoundland 
Fishermen, Food and Allied Workers Association. 
We s<*e the seal as being exactly the same as tin* lobster, the caplin or any tither living resources to be harvested.' The caplin is a small fish similar to a smelt.

You never have to go to the hospital to collect. It pays just as much and in some cases more out of the hospital than it does in the hospital. For an example: You can collect the same benefits outlined on the opposite page IN or OUT of the hospital. It matters not whether it’s in the doctor’s office, clinic or home and of course, also in the hospital. In fact, you can collect on medicines, drugs and prescriptions out of the hospital in addition to the other benefits outlined that you can collect on while IN or O U T of the hospital. 
Please notice on the opposite page you also may collect on doctors’ visits in the doctor's office, clinic, home as well as in the hospital NO, you do not E V E R have to be confined to the hospital to collect the benefits outlined on the oppo­ site pace as provided for in the policy .

W HO NEEDS T H IS T Y PE POLICY 
T H E MOST AND W H Y ? lins policy was designed for people of all walks of life. 
Many people are too busy to go to the hospital, such as working people, executives, professional people, farmers, ranchers and the working breadwinner who can’t afford to be off of work too long. YET they need insurance cover­ age to help foot the bills when they go to the doctor’s office, clinic or if treated at home. Yet it will also help them if they have to go to the hospital. ALSO, HOW ABOUT 

T H E T I M E S W H E N T H E H O S P I T A L S A R E SO 
CROW DED YOU C A N ’T G E T IN? 

W H A T IF I HAVE O T H E R INSURANCE 
OR M EDICARE, MEDICAID, E T C .? 
It doesn’t matter. This policy pays full policy benefits in addition to any other insurance carried with any other com­ pany or company group, also in addition to W orkmen’s 
Compensation. If you are covered under Medicare, Medic­ aid or any other Governmental Medical Program, it sure will help fill the gaps that Medicare, Medicaid or any other 
Governmental Medical Program does not pay as limited and provided for in the policy. You who arc under Medi­ care particularly need this policy to help fill the gaps that 
Medicare does not pay and those gaps are getting wider each year. Y O U Became Responsible for Paying Consider­ ably More in 1975 than Y O U Were Responsible for Pay­ ing in 1974. In Fact, in 1975 Y O U Became Responsible for paying 
13o% 
M O RE Since 
Medicare Started. 
Of course, if you do not have any insurance YOU definitely need it. R E M E M B E R 
THIS IS D EFIN ITELY AN IN 
O R O U T OF T H E HO SPITA L POL ICY FOR A L L AGES 
AND REGARDLESS OF Y O U R STATUS IN LIFE. 

W ILL YOU PAY B EN EFITS D IRECTLY T O ME 
AND ARE T H E Y TAX F R E E ? 
YES — We pay all benefits directly to YOU, unless YOU authorize us differently. In other words, the only way we will pay directly to the doctor, clinic or hospital is for S OU to tell us to do so YES — T H E MONEY YOU RECEIV E 
FOR THESE BENEFITS IS T A X I R L E . 

DOES T H E POLICY CONTAIN ANY 
LIM ITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS? 
Of course, it does, but they are fair and reasonable. Many advertisers would lead you to believe that their policy contains none, but this is not true. All policies have Limi­ tations and Exclusions, or Exceptions or by whatever tech­ nical name they wish to call them, and some policies are so cleverly worded that after you read the policy you are confused as to whether they have any or not, but we can assure you they do. A policy without any Limitations, 
Exclusions or Exceptions would cost so much most of us could not afford the premium. W ith your permission we are going to furnish you a policy for 3o days without any obligations IF YOU W IL L SIM PLY F IL L O U T AND 
M AIL T H E A T T A C H E D

Is Written in Simple Everyday Understandable Language. 

< AN YOU CANUEL ME O U T ? 
The Company guarantees never to cancel YOUR policy or change YOUR premium rates in any direction regardless of how many claims YOU have or how old YOU get or for any other reason unless a general rate adjustment or termination is made of all policies of the same type in your entire state.

HOW DOES THIS POLICY COMPARE WITH THE CASH POLICIES ADVERTISED? 

Frankly, in our honest sincere opinion there is not much of a comparison. 
EXAMPLE: You do not have to be confined to the hospital to collect on this policy. All the cash policies we have seen advertised you must be confined to the hospital to collect any cash income benefits. SECONDLY, and most important most all of them that we have seen have a certain number of elimination days before you can collect anything even after you do go to the hospital Some advertisers would have you believe by calling these elimination days "waiting periods" which gives many people the impression that after the policy has been in effect 3, 4, 5, 6. or 7 days that you are going to be covered immediately when you go to the hospital. T H IS IS NOT TRUE. These so called "waiting period days" really means elimination days on each hos pital confinement. FOR EXAMPLE, if and when you go to the hospital and you are entitled to benefits under the provisions of the policy, you CANNOT 
START COLLECTING ONE RED CENT until you have been confined to the hospital on each confinement past the elimination days or waiting period days In other words, if your cash policy has a 3 day waiting period and you are confined in the hospital 3 days, YOU GET NOTHING. You M UST be confined 4 days and then you can collect the benefits FOR ONE DAY ONLY lf your cash policy calls for 4, 5, 6, or 7 day waiting days or elimination days,YOU DO NOT COLLECT ANYTHING unless you are confined at least ONE 
DAY M ORE than the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th day. Then you will only be entitled to so much a day for every day after the elimination or waiting period days that you are confined ANOTHER EXAMPLE: lf your cash policy has a 7 day 

 waiting period, and you are confined 7 days, YOU GET NOTHING, lf you are confined 8 days — you will receive benefits for only ONE ( I) DAY. In other words, if you have a $1,ooo.oo a month cash policy and you are in the hos­ pital for 8 days — and you are entitled to benefits under the policy, you will be entitled to a TOTAL OF $33.33 FOR THE ENTIRE 8 DAYS and NO MORE. lf you have a $5oo.oo a month hospital cash policy under the same condi­ tions, you would be entitled to collect a TOTAL OF $16.67 FOR THE ENTIRE 
8 DAY hospital confinement. It is a known fact that most of your hospital expense is incurred during the first 3 days of confinement and IT’S ALSO 
A KNOW N FACT THAT THE AVERAGE H OSPITAL C O N FIN EM EN T TODAY IS 
ONLY 8 DAYS. 

C O M PARE THE RATES OF T H IS POLICY WITH THE CASH PO LIC IES 
YOU 
WILL FIN D VERY LITTLE D IFFEREN CE AND IN SO M E C A SE S THE RATES OF 
THIS POLICY ARE EVEN LESS, EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO TO 
THE HOSPITAL TO COLLECT AND IF YOU DO, THERE ARE NO ELIM IN A TIO N 
DAYS. 

When you receive this policy,compare it with the cash policies in their entirety and YOU D ECIDE which is the best for your money. Of course, we pay full policy benefits as provided for in the policy regardless of how many or what type policies you carry with other com panies including Cash Policies. 
ASK YOUR DOCTOR HOW IM PO RTANT IT IS FOR YOU TO HAVE A POLICY 
THAT PAYS IN OR OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. 

YES 

We Also Pay These Benefits Directly to You and NOT To The Doctor, Clinic or Hospital U N L E S S YOU AUTHORIZE US TO DO SO, 
AND THE CASH YOU RECEIVE FROM T H ESE BENEFITS IS TAX FREE.
