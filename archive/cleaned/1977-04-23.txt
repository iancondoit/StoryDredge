Giant car-truck theft ring investigated 

By JERRY DEAL 
What could turn out to be the largest car-truck theft ring in the city’s history — possibly in­ volving p o licem en — is being probed by the San Antonio P o ­ lice D epartm ent’s top brass. 
C arter to ask hospital controls 

N E W Y O R K TIMES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON — President Carter will send a program to control health costs to Congress on Monday. The program will propose the placing of a ceiling on increases in hospital charges that would aim at saving both federal health projects and consumers 
$2 billion next year. 
The legislation would impose a limit on the yearly increase in charges for nearly every hospital in the country and already has generated intense opposition from leading medical groups. 
The percentage increases hospitals could charge would be tied to the cost of living in an effort to dampen rises in hospital costs that have been going up at twice the rate of the increase in the consumer price index. 
Government officials said the al­ lowable increase for hospital charges under the legislation would be almost 9 per cent in 1978 if the inflation rate is about B per cent, as expected. 
The president of the American 
Hospital Association, John Alexander 
McMahon, said a lower rate of infla­ tion might reduce permissible in­ creases in hospital costs to as low as 8 per cent. 

‘‘I'm certain that any across the board ceiling will bring the total op­ position of the hospital field, but the real losers will be the sick and injured w hose services would not be increased and in many cases even reduced?* he added. 
Dr. James H. Sammons, the execu­ tive vice president of the American 
Medical Association, predicted that if the President’s program is enacted it would result in cutbacks in some ser­ vices now provided by hospitals be­ cause “ you obviously have to cut 

A police investigator told the Ex- press-News up to 2o11 automobiles and trucks may be involved in the theft ring. Also, a loan employe from a ma­ jor local bank reportedly has been fired in connection with the probe. 
Chief of Police E. E. Peters said a 
“ possible” auto theft ring was being investigated. 

He acknowledged there is a possibi­ lity of law enforcement officers being involved in the ring. 
“ We always look for that possibility since there is police inspection in­ volved.’’ he said. 
Peters said Insp. Jack Hutton and 
Auto Theft Division Lt. Wilbert Ro- bitsch are in charge of the probe. 

A Texas Department of Public Safety employe in Austin said all card files from at least one San Antonio auto dealer are being “ pulled’’ from the 
DPS files. 
All the cars and trucks involved in these files are expected to be towed into the San Antonio Police Car Pound. 
A spokesman at the pound said many 

 cars “ involved in that auto theft ring” have been taken to the pound. 

But other officers disagree. 

“ There’s not a thing wrong; we’re jelling in some cars and we’re work­ ing on a case,” Lt. Robitsch said. 

“ I think a policeman went amuck 

 and is telling the press lies.” 
He also denied three officers, whose names were given the Express-New s by another policemen, are being in­ vestigated by the department’s Inter­ nal Affairs Division. 
The Express-News was told in confi­ dence many of the vehicles involved

WASHINGTON (AP) - Most of the United States will begin six months of Daylight Saving 
Time at 2 a.m. Sunday. 

This means elocks shouid be moved forward one hour, result­ ing in an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day. 

Unless Congress intervenes — and there are some suggestions it will — DST (or fast time) will prevail through the last Sunday in October. 

Some members of Congress want to extend DST for seven or eight months a year — largely as a means of conserving energy.

“ Parts of her body were exposed.” said Lt. David Keene, head of the San 
Antonio Police Departm ent’s Hom i­ cide Division. 
Keene said there was also a large pool of blood on the bed as well as blood spatters on two walls. 
“ It appears she was killed after she had taken a bath and had rolled up her hair.” Keene said. 
Work 
The woman was scheduled to report to her job as a nurse at Wilford Hall 
Medical Center at 3 p.m., Keene said 
Police reported the woman appeared to have been dead for at least a couple of hours. 
The victim’s husband told officers he left her at the apartment early Friday- arid discovered her body upon return from work. 
Mardis, whose left arm was ampu­ tated sometime ago due to a bout with cancer, convinced the Air Force phy­ sical evaluation board last year to let him stay in the service at his job de­ signing and monitoring construction projects at Kelly. 
Keene said the woman was appar­ ently attacked with a sharp object. No such object was recovered, he added. 
Officers reported nothing else in the apartment appeared to have been dis­ turbed. Keene said it will be up the to the medical examiner to determine if the woman was sexually assaulted. 
Remains o f MIA flier found 

WASHINGTON (A P ) - North 
Vietnam has found another body of a U. S. servicem an m issin g from the Indochina war, State 
D e p a r tm e n t s p o k e s m a n n o d ­ ding Carter said Friday. 
Although the family has been no­ tified, the spokesman said no details would be made public until a positive identification is made. 
Carter would only say the American was an “ airm an’’ whose body was found in North Vietnam. 
To date, the Hanoi government has returned the remains of ll U.S. ser­ vicemen. They have promised to re­ turn the body of an American civilian in addition to the rem ains of the airman whose discovery was disclosed 
Friday. 
( arter said an arrangement made by 
North Vietnam to intensify the search for missing Americans has been working. However, he gave no indica­ tion whether more bodies could be ex­ pected to be recovered. About 2,2oo 
U.S. servicemen are listed as missing in action throughout Indochina 
Hanoi’s uti icial Vietnam i\ews 
Agency reported that the body was that of a pilot killed Dee. 2H, 1972. during an air raid in North Vietnam by B52 bombers.

Coal miners’ children laud parents in book 

BA RN KS BO HO. Pa. (AP) - Coal has been king in this mining town for generations, but young people w ere never proud of it or of their fath e rs’ jobs in the mines. Now that's changed. 
I he pupils at N o rth ern C a m b ria 
High School think more people should be like the hardy folks who toil under the earth and they have w ritten two books about their coal m ining h e ri­ tage. 
“ W e’ve com e a long w a y .” said 
Principal Richard Zanella, who grew un here. “ The students have learned 

 that their parents, g randparents and neighbors are people to be proud of.” 

“ As children of mining folk, we al­ ways wished that our parents could be more like other people, more sleek and sophisticated.” admitted the pupils ifi their second book “ Out of the Dark 2*

“ We were asham ed to adm it that oui' fath ers m ined coal ... O ur p a re n ts never joined the sp in eless com fort cult, and they never forgot the m ean­ ing of work."

A .23 caliber pistol was recovered M the scene. A suspect was apprehended by police after a bystander grabbed the alleged a ssailan t bv the hair ana wrestled him to the ground, officer^ said.

Farm fo r sale

Arthur Godfrey’s 
1.967-acre Beacon Hill farm near 
Leesburg, Va., is being offered for sale for $6 million.

In addition to the big house, where Godfery’s wife, 
Mary, has lived most of the time for 3o years and to which he has commuted on weekends from his apartm ent and office in New York, the Beacon Hill property contains IO other sm aller houses, some of them historic. 

Some are rented to the staff that runs the beef cattle and horse farm for the Godfreys. Mary Godfrey is an avid horsewoman.

Carter credits, 

N E W V O R K TIM ES SERV ICE 
WASHINGTON — President Carter said Friday he might veto revamped tax legislation aimed at giving the economy a stim ulus, following the 
S en ate’s rejection T hursday of his request to scrap business tax credits. 
The Senate had gone along with the 
President’s revised tactics in dum ping the $5o rebate that was to be the centerpiece of the stimulus program, but it decided by a vote of 74 to 2o 
Thursday to keep business tax breaks in the program, increase incentives of companies both hire additional workers and invest more in enlarging productive capacity. 
Displeased 

I he President said at his new s con­ ference Friday that he was not in favor of extending bonuses to business after depriving indiv iduals of their Sat), and he added that if the business incentiv es are in the bill that finally pusses Con­ gress. “ FII have to decide . . . whether 
1 11 sign it or not." 
I he H ouse has a lre a d y p assed a varied form of business credit in its tax stim u lu s, and so it is virtually certain that business will got som eth­ ing from the bill before it leaves the 
C apitol. F in a l S en ate p a s s a g e is expected around the m iddle of next week. Before landing on the P r e s i­ d e n t's desk, the bill would go to a 
House-Senate conference to bridge the differing versions. 
D esp ite the P r e s i d e n t 's tough- sounding words Friday, it was doubtful the business credits alone would spark a veto. 
Analysts said the adm inistration may in fact not bt* too unhappy with 

Suddenly, the top policy m akers are paying more attention to the Arab a r­ guments. 
The change in the political balance has been so delicate that it has been hardly perceptible. There has been no twisting of arm s, no dangling of econ­ omic bait, no influence buying in the 
Korean manner. 
The policy m akers simply have be­ come aware that the Arabs now speak with more authority than they used to. 
The story is told between the lines of secret documents, which describe the increasing dependence of the United 
States on A rab oil and the grow ing economic power of the Arab oil poten­ tates. 
Details 

• A CIA analysis, cited by President 
Carter, w arns that the worldwide de­ mand for oil is likely to outstrip supply in the next five to IO years. 
The P resident d id n ’t mention that the CIA also estimates that the United 
States will double its oil imports from 
Saudi Arabia by 198o. 
The United States now im ports 1.2 million barrels of oil from Saudi Ara­ bia every day. This is expect­ ed to hit a daily 2.5 million b a r r e l s in le ss th an th re e years. 
• 
A separate, secret CIA s u rv ey c la im s th a t the oil- producing countries now have a pro d ig io u s $34 billion in ­ vested in U.S. holdings. 
The A rab oil sh e ik d o m s have e n ­ trusted their portfolios to such mighty banks as the Bank of America, Chase 
M anhattan. F irst National City Bank and Morgan Guaranty. 
T hese financial institutions speak with a soft voice but carry big clout in the backrooms of Washington. 
• Secret Treasury documents reveal that the Saudis have asked the indus­ trial nations for safeg u ard s against inflation, fluctuating exchange rates and political uncertainties. 
One classified m em o suggests that the .Saudis feel they’ve been taken ad­ vantage of. 
To help alleviate the world energy shortage, they have produced m ore oil than they need to sell to m eet their own revenue nt*eds. The surplus has gone into investments in the W'est, particu­ larly the United States. 
Safeguards 

The Saudis, therefore, feel they de­ s e rv e s a f e g u a r d s for th e ir in v e s t­ ments. They have asked for assurances that th e ir overseas assets w on’t be frozen. They want an “ in d ex atio n ” agreem ent, which would tie their oil revenues lo changes in inflation. 
U n less th e ir a s s e ts a re p ro p erly protected, the Saudis have suggested, they m ay be compelled to keep their wealth in the ground. In other words, thev may cut back oil production. 
Yet the Saudis feel that “ all they get from the West, particularly the U.S.,” one secret Treasury m emo states, “ is abuse in the form of anti-boycott le­ gislation and th re a ts, and the p o st­ ponement of arm s sales.” 
The memo sum s up the new political realities in these succinct words: “ The 
Saudis’ . . . financial surplus is really beginning to mount rapidly. Their le­ verage on the industrial countries has increased.” 
Oil fiasco 
P resident C arter has called for sa­ crifices to reduce oil consumption. 
A s im ila r ap p e a l was m a d e four years ago by then-President Richard 
Nixon. He also sought to encourage 

 more domestic oil production by slap­ ping fees on oil imports. 
Ii was left to the F ed eral E n erg y 
Administration to collect the fees. This undertaking, known form ally as the 
Mandatory Oil Imports Program , has been a fiasco. 
Perhaps the failure can be attributed to bureaucratic bungling. Or perhaps the adm inistrators, who are known to be soft on Big Oil, were reluctant to put the bite on their oil friends. We can't say. 
But we have had access to the top- 

 secret findings of an audit, which tells the story. “ Controls and procedures w ere in a d e q u a te ,” the g o v e rn m e n t auditors found, “ to assure that the fees 
. . . were properly assessed and col­ lected.’’ 
Haphazard 

The collections were so haphazard th a t the a d m i n i s t r a t o r s n ev e r got straight how’ much the oil companies: were paying. 
“ There was no operational system to v erify th a t c o m p an ies w ere paying import fees on oil im ports,” states the audit, “ even though over $56o,ooo in contracts were awarded to com puter­ ize and improve the program .” 
The import reports submitted by the oil companies were not checked. Tho energy agency, therefore, “ had no as­ surance that duplicate or fraudulent licenses were not being used and t h a t . im porters were paying all the re ­ quired su p p lem en tal fees on oil im ­ ports. 
Fee refund 
But h e re ’s the kicker. “ Under ce r­ tain conditions,” the auditors report, 
“ co m p an ies can req u est refu n d s of import fees . . . The refunds were de­ termined by the companies, and there was no verification of these amounts to determ ine appropriateness and accur­ acy. The integrity of the com panies was relied upon to furnish correct rt*r fund am ounts.” 
In other words, the oil companies got back as much money as they request­ ed. no questions asked. 
“ Some im proper refunds were iden­ tified,” states the audit. So much for the integrity of the oil companies. 
P e rh a p s needless to day, the p ro ­ gram did little to discourage imports and encourage dom estic production. 
Oil imports rose from a daily 3.4 m il­ lion barrels in 197o to 6 million barrels in 1975. 
A spokesm an for the im ports fees program told us that program officials disagreed with the audit. He said the audit was done haphazardly and too quickly. 

The p o licy makers sim ply have become aware that the 
Arabs now speak with more authority than they used to 

Bullock: Plan would affect state revenues 

He’s quit spinning yarns 

One of the urgings of Mohandas 
K. Gandhi was that his followers should spend some tim e every day at the spinning wheel. India’s new 
Prim e Minister Morarji Desai is a strong follower of Gandhi, but he says he's now so busy that he c a n ’t get to his spinning, which he re­ gards as an im portant daily task. 
“ I was spinning for two hours every day,” Desai said of the days before he becam e Prim e Minister, 
“ but now I am not able to do it for even five minutes of every day. I don’t get half a m inute to myself from morning to 9:3o in the night.” 
Desai, who is 81-years-old, says he hopes to get back to his spinning for at least a half-hour a day w ithin a month. 
Kirov Ballet to get new choreographer 

In a shakeup aimed at bolstering the declining reptutation of Lenin­ g ra d ’s world-famed Kirov Ballet, 
Oleg Vinogradov is expected to be named chief of choreography, suc­ ceeding 
Igor Belsky, who was removed earlier this month after four years in the post. 
The com pany had gone into a slum p, critics say, becauese its perform ances were showing little im agination and few new works 

 were being performed. 
There also had been a defection to the West of some of the Kirov’s top stars, including Rudolph Nureyev,

The total cost of the proposals, he said, would be approximately $4 billion over the next eight years. 
While the program probably would be slig h tly in fla tio n a ry , he said it might also have a beneficial effect on employment and economic growth. 
“ The most conservative and unfa­ vorable analysis shows that it will have no adverse im pact.” he said. “ Some computer-model studies show that it will actually increase the num ber of jobs by several hundred thousand.” 
He said that gasoline rationing would be a "viable alternative," a favorite 
Washington expression he has picked up in the last four m onths, if there were an oil em bargo imposed on the country. He added, however, that he saw no likelihood of that sort of n a­ tional crisis. j 
After agreeing that rationing would be a fall-back position for the adm in­ istration if m ilder m easures proved insufficient, the President said that if his energy proposals are adopted by the Congress, he saw no reason “ in the future of ever having rationing.”

AUSTIN (AP) — Comptroller Bob 
Bullock said Friday it is clear that 
President C arter’s energy proposals, if enacted into law, would affect Texas revenues. 
“ Some m ay rise and o th e rs m ay drop.” Bullock said in a statem ent. 
The co m p tro ller said his rev en u e estimating section is carefully analyz­ ing Carter’s energy plan to determ ine w hat effect it m ay h av e on s ta te revenues for the 1978-79 business year. 
“ However, I wish to em phasize that the Texas Constitution req u ires that our estimates be bused only upon laws then in effect. This m eans that those proposals requiring legislation cannot change our estimate until they become law.” Bullock said. 
“ I also want to em phasize that, in looking at our estimate, we have come to the conclusion that there is just so m uch w ater you can pour out of a bucket before it is empty. You’ve got to fill it up again before you can pour some m ore.”

N E W YO R K TIM ES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - President C arter said Friday that he could not g u a r­ antee that all money collected by the federal government through the taxes proposed in his energy plan would be re tu rn e d to the A m eric an people through rebates and refunds. 
His rem ark s seem ed to reflect a subtle retreat from his original pledge to simply turn such funds around and redistribute them into the economy. 
“ We still have to have some flexibi­ lity about exactly what we do,” he said in a press conference here. “ I can't certify today that every nickel of the taxes collected will be refunded to consum ers." 
S till, he sa id la te r , it w as h is 
“ present inclination,'’ to insure that the gasoline taxes and the increases in fuel taxes included in his plan for con­ serving such com m od ities “ to a sub-

Friday that rebates on fuel-efficient cars, under its proposed energy program, might not apply equally to imports.

It was the sixth press conference of his ad m in istra tio n and focused pri- 

 sm all imports such as V o lk sw a ­ gens, Toyotas and sim ilar cars might be limited to the number imported in some base year. 

In effect, this would give foreign manufacturers less rebate money to spread among their cars; it would reduce rebates on imported cars, compared to Detroit products getting the same mileage. 

 m arily on the P resid en t’s energy le­ gislation delivered to the C ongress 
Wednesday night, a plan he defended 
Friday as equitable and even-handed in its call for sacrifice. 
He said, oil companies would not be allowed to profit from an expected in­ cre a se in the price of gasoline and other petroleum fuels, and he predict­ ed the plans’s call for a new em phasis on coal as a prim ary source of energy would be a m a jo r b u rd e n for the corporate oil sector.

Bexar eyeing computer tallies 

By DEBORAH WESER 
The obvious su ccess of San 
A n tonio’s new com p uterized voter tally system has already drawn Bexar County interest. 
Com. Albert Bustamante and County 
Clerk Robert Green both looked over the system during election night at 
City Hall. Green now is analysing the system to see just how it can be applied to countywide elections. 
V irtu ally le tter -p er fe ct in its response, the system devised by City 
Clerk Garland .Jackson relies on com ­ puter tabulation rather than hand counting as has been done in the past. 
Within two hours of the polls’ closing on April 2, a full tally was available to observers, .Jackson pointed out. 
Accurate 
The system 's accuracy proved solid when it was used again in the runoff more recently. 
If Green is able to adapt the system to his needs, he feels it will reduce costs considerably, particularly where luring of people is concerned. 
No final decision has been made at the county level but C om m issioners 
Court was briefed recently on its pos­ sible adoption. 
The big stumbling block, for Green, is the number of ballot forms — that depends on the number of races and the number of candidates — he will have to devise. 
“We’ll run at least 54 (ballot forms) and possibly m ore,” he indicated, not­ ing that federal, state and county level posts will be up for grabs next year. 
.Jackson had only ll ballot form s since he had IO district candidates and the mayor as the constant factor on each baUot. 
“ T h ese are not in su rm ou n tab le problems but they do have to be looked at,” Green added. “ And you have to study them in the light of Murphy’s 
Law — what can possibly go wrong? 
Because, you know, if it can go wrong, it w ill.” 
.Jackson, m eanw hile, explained it took his crew of experimenters about four months to devise the com puter­ ized election tallying system . 
Gone from it completely is the use of j punch cards as an interim step in the counting process. Candidate names, precincts and other pertinent details are already program m ed into the computer. All that is needed on elec­ tion night are the vote totals as they come in. 
Two computer term inals are keyed to the program in election central headquarters, .Jackson continued. 
Checks 

At one, the operator feeds in the raw voting figures as they come along. The second operator, accepting those writ­ ten figures, checks them against the totals brought up on his terminal, the clerk explained. 
J a ck so n ’s sy stem produced a num ber-perfect result on the first election and showed only a handful of counting errors in the runoff. lf the county can adapt the c ity ’s com p uter program to its m ore complicated election picture, then the system also would be made a v a ila b le to Republican and Democratic Party officials for use in their prim aries, 
Green noted. 
Jack son , m ean w h ile, cred ited staffers at the city/City W'ater Board’s 
Consolidated Data Processing Center with the election programming work. 
“ Ifs something you can't wait until the day before to do, but there’s no end to the number of ballots you can put on there,” Jackson said. 
So far as the city clerk knows, San 
Antonio may be the first city to have tested a successful computerized vote tallying system. 
"Everyone I’ve talked to uses punch cards. I think we’re probably the first ones who’ve used direct input into the computer,” Jackson added. 
Gas lighl still shining brightly 

DALLAS (AP) — When Lone Star 
Gas Co. in Dallas got a call this week from a family who wanted to have an outdoor g a slig h t d iscon n ected , the company representative asked why. 
, “ Didn t you hear the President?" the family caller answered. “ W e’re running out of energy and want to do our part.” 
The utility representative said the gaslight “only costs you $2.85 a month and the light doesn’t use that much gas. It adds safety to your house.” 
But the caller insisted. 
“OK,” the company said. “ It’ll cost you $16.” 
“Sixteen dollars just to disconnect a light?” the caller asked. 
“That’s right, $16,” cam e the reply. 
“Take it or leave it.” 
The light still shines, a beacon of economic reality.

Texas in line for IO m ore federal judges 

By BILL MINTZ 
A U.S. Senate committee has approved a bill creating IO new federal judgeships in Texas, in­ cluding only one in the Western

And float after float in the annual 
Battle of the Flowers parade drew ap­ plause from a crowd estimated by San 
Antonio police at 29o,(KH) persons. 

(See parade pictures on Page HJA.) 
Crowds began lining streets as early as IO a.m. for the nation’s fourth lar­ gest parade, first staged in 1891. 
Gas explosion stalls marchers 

A propane gas tank exploded at a hot dog stand during the 
Battle of Flowers Parade Fri­ day, slightly injuring three people and stopping the parade near its origin for about IO minutes. 

F lam es shot out from the stand, at Broadway and Pearl 
P arkw ay, sen d in g parade watchers scurry ing to safety. 

Slightly burned were Mary 
Ochoa, 25, 56o6 Arlitt ,St., Gua­ dalupe Serna, 3oo Yale St., both parade spectators, and Jesse 

Barrera, 2o, a hot dog stand employe. 

Barrera said at first there was a sm all fire at the base of a stove, “ then it just blew up.” 
He received minor burns on his left arm. 

Police quickly stopped cur- iousity seekers from getting too close until a Fire Department unit arrived about IO minutes after the blast. 

A fter the fir e fig h te r s ar­ rived. the parade resumed at the location. 

The people arrived carrying lawn chairs, picnic hampers and ice chests in preparation for the long and hot but entertaining afternoon that awaited them. 
For those' who cam e unprepared, the custom ary foot-long hot dogs, corn- on-the-cob, popcorn, peanuts and cot­ ton candy were carted by the many street hawkers. 

Multi-colored balloons, hats, flags, warbling birds and horns sold by ven­ dors provided pre-parade entertain­ ment for the children. But they soon grew tired of toys and many “ Mommy, where’s the parade?” cries were heard before the Fiesta procession got under way. 
But once it started, restless, crying ch ild ren perked up, sat back and sm iled and waved enthusiastically at the passing floats. 
Oohs and aahs 

“ O ohs” and “ a h s” preceded the more beautiful floats and the sharper precision units, with applause break­ ing out whenever a majorette caught her high-flung baton. 
The viewers also clapped along with fam iliar fight songs and stood som - 

“ I don’t understand how Carter can say his new energy plan allow s for deregulation when it places regula­ tions on intrastate gas production — an area never fed era lly regulated b e­ fore,” Briscoe said. 

B riscoe attacked C arter’s new en ­ ergy plan during a press conference at 
La Mansion Hotel follow ing his ad­ dress to the South Texas Press Assn. convention. 

“ Carter’s plan is simply another in­ vasion by the federal bureaucracy into state m atters,” he said. “The plan is going in the wrong direction since pro­ vides no incentive to producing states to explore for new oil and gas. 

Congress 

“ I intend to fight it in C ongress through the Texas delegation. We’ve done our sh are in provid in g th is country with energy. 

“ All w e’re saying is leave us alone, 
Big Brother, and let us get on about our job.” 

Briscoe said it was fact, not rumor, that he would co n sid er taking the m atter to the courts if he is unsuc­ cessfu l in changing the p lan’s pro­ visions through Congress. 

“ We are considering a possible law­ suit as a last resort to stop this federal attack on intrastate com m erce.” 
Carter’s m assive energy proposal, am ong other things, allows for new 
U.S. gas and oil prices to rise to inter­ national prices. 
But it would place all natural gas prices under federal control, perm it­ ting the price to rise from about $1.47 per thousand cubic feet to about $1.75. 
The Carter Plan also calls for a ga­ soline tax of about five cents per gallon to limit gas consumption. 
“ There is no need for additional taxes — federal or s ta te ,” B riscoe said. “The tax on gasoline would hit hardest those with the least ability to pay. 
“ What the governm ent has got to learn is gas is not a luxury; it’s a ne­ cessity.” 
Briscoe said his feelings on the en­ ergy plan were simply a disagree­ ment with Carter and was not a break away from him. 
“ Friends can disagree without being disagreeable. This is just a disagree­ m ent.” 

M ississippi, Alabama. Georgia and 
Florida would continue to be in the 5th 
Circuit. 
The proposal for IO new d istric t judgeships in Texas follow s recom ­ mendations by the U.S. Judicial Con­ ference, the ruling body of the judicial branch of the U.S. government. 
Spears’ request 

But the plan for only one more judge in the Western District is a setback for 
C hief U .S. D ist. Ju d ge A drian A. 
Spears, who argued for three m ore judges in the district, which stretches from San Antonio to El Paso. 
Spears and four other judges now preside over the d istrict’s seven d i­ visions. 
El Paso, which now has one judge, and Midland, which has no full-tim e judge, both want the new resident po­ sition. 
Judge Spears has argued the size of the Western District, which is larger than som e sta te s, req u ires m ore judges to cut down on travel time. 
Travel time 

He said the five judges spend a total of 125 working days traveling on court business. 
The Senate Judiciary C om m ittee. which approved the courts bill Thurs­ day, had sought to cut Texas’ share of the new judgeships to seven, but Sen. 
Edward Kennedy pushed through an amendment to the bill to include all IO positions. 
A K ennedy staffer said the bill pro­ bably will be sent to the floor in about one month. 
Amendment 

Kennedy offered the amendment at the urging of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of 
Texas, the staffer said. 
The bill includes five new judgeships in the Southern District, three in the 
Northern District and one in the Eas­ tern District. 
The Southern D istrict in clu d es 
Houston, Corpus Christi, Brownsville and Laredo. 
That district now has eight judges. 
The Senate passed a judgeship bill during the last session of Congress but the session ended before the full House could act on the measure.

Execution stay OKd 

Judge cites 
Davis lawyers 

FORT WORTH, (AP) 
— State District Court 
Judge Tom Cave Friday cited for contem pt of jcourt two of millionaire 
Cullen Davis’ attorneys saying they had filed m otions intended basically to increase the publicity given Davis’ capital murder tial. 
The contempt citation against attorneys R i­ chard Haynes and Phil 
Burleson referred to af­ fidavits submitted Mon­ day by the two in their motion to have 
Davis released on bail pending his trial. 
Davis is charged with the Aug. 3 slaying of his stepdaughter 
Andrea 
Wilborn, 12. He is also charged in connection with the shooting death of 
Stan Farr, a friend of his estranged wife Priscilla; and the wounding of Mrs. 
Davis and Gus Gavrel. 
The shootings occurred in the 
Davis mansion where Mrs. Davis lived while the couple was un­ dergoing divorce proceedings. 

.Mistrial 

The selection of a jury for the trial ended last week when Judge Cave declared a mistrial after eight weeks because a ju­ ror had expressed an opinion about Davis’ pos­ sible guilt in a telephone conversation. 
The attorneys went back to the court Monday submitting unsigned af­ fidavits by 
David 
McCrory claiming a link between Mrs. Davis with a Fort Worth drug dealer identified only as W.T. 
The affidavits also in­ cluded a reference to an imDlied bribe from Mrs. 
Davis to 
McCrory. 

DALLAS (AP) - U.S. 
District 
Court 
Judge 
Robert Porter granted a stay of execution Friday for 
Ernest 
Benjamin 
Smith J r ., sentenced to death by a Dallas jury for the 1973 murder-robbery of convenience store clerk 
Stewart Moon. 
Porter ordered a procedural hearing on the matter for April 29. 
In granting his stay, 
Porter cited possible con­ stitutional questions in the sentencing phase of 
Smith’s trial. 
Howie Ray Robinson was the convicted trig- german in the slaying. He was convicted of capital murder in the case, but the 
Texas 
Court of 
Criminal Appeals threw out his death sentence. He will receive a new trial. 

Robinson case 

Porter cited the Robin­ son case and said that defense lawyers should have time to study the legal ramifications of that case. 
“No one will be hurt by this stay,’’ Porter said. 
Smith’s attorney had contended that the death sentence for Smith was 
“ disproportionately se­ vere” because he did not pull the trigger in the murder. 

Betty Ford in hospital 

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. 
(A P) — F orm er F irst 
Lady Betty Ford has been admitted to Eisenhower 
Medical 
Center for diagnostic tests on a recurring pinched nerve in her neck, a Ford spo­ kesman said. 

Mrs. Ford, 59, who en­ tered the medical center 
Thursday morning, is ex­ pected to be released Sa­ turday morning, accord­ ing to Greg W illard, a 
Ford staff assistant. 

Smith’s request for a stay of execution was in­ cluded in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
The petition argued that the death penalty for a non-triggerman is not in accord “ with contempor­ ary values concerning the dignity of m an.” It also alleged that Texas death sentences are imposed 
‘‘in an arbitrary and ca ­ pricious, wanton and freakish pattern.” 

R i g h t s 

The petition also con­ tended that- Sm ith’s rights had been violated in regard to testimony by a psychiatrist and the jury selection process. 
Earlier this week, the 
Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals denied a writ of habeas corpus in the case without hearing. 
Smith had testified that he and Robinson went into the store while a third man waited in a getaway car. He said Robinson shot Moon when the vic­ tim made a motion as if reaching behind his back for a gun. Smith said he and Robinson escaped with a pistol and about 
$3oo in coins. 
Asst. Dist. Atty. Steve 
Tokoly said, ‘‘We don’t have to concede Howie 
Robinson committed the murder. It makes little difference who pulled the trig g e r...because they were acting together.”

Russian plane penetrates U.S. radar defense 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - A Soviet reconnaissance bomber evaded 
U.S. air defense radar in pene­ trating closer than ever before to the East Coast, Pentagon 
^purees said Friday. 
*'The sources said the TU-95 Bear flew 
$?low the radar to reach four U.S. 
\?£rsbips, including the aircraft car­ rier Saratoga, conducting training between HO and 75 miles from the 
«WKJSt. 
'^Normally, TU-95s remain from 15o to about 2oo miles off the U.S. coastline when they fly between Russia and 
Cuba, as they have been doing at ir­ regular intervals since 197o. 
2£The U.S. Air Force sent two F-4 
^Phantom jet fighters from Seymour 
3ohnson Air Force Base. N.C.. but 
JJiere was no contact and the Soviet bomber went on its way without in­ cident, sources said. Navy aircraft from the carrier Saratoga also were 
Soft in the area, but it is not known 
Jfhat. part, if any, they played. m The incident occured over interna* lienal waters on April 14, a few days after the U.S. Coast Guard seized 
Soviet ships inside the 2oo-mile fishing 
*limit. i While confirming the Soviet recon­ naissance bomber penetration, defense 

(Senator proposes free mail system 

! WASHINGTON (A P) - Sen, John 
J Durkin proposed on Friday that free 
•mail privileges be extended to citizens 
I w hen they w rite to members of Con­ gress and the President. 
The congressional franking system lets senators and House members send 
' mail free to their constituents. A bill 
.offered by Durkin on Friday would 
; make this a two-way street. 

 officials say they know of no connec­ tion between this episode and the/fish­ ing ship seizure. 
The Bears normally fly in pairs and sources said it was believed two TU 95s were picked up on radar while flying several hundred miles southeast of 
Charlestown. S.C. 
Then. sources said, the aircraft, van­ ished from the North American Air 
Defense Command’s radar until one 
TU-95 appeared near the U.S. war­ ships, which included the guided missile cruiser Biddle, the guided missile frigate Talbot and the frigate 
Garcia, as well as the Saratoga. 
Earlier reports had said two Bears reached the U S. ships. The TTJ-95s are equipped with cameras and electronic intelligence gathering devices, as well as two types of antiship missiles, ac­ cording to U.S. intelligence informa­ tion. 
The United States has thinned out its air defense screen over the past dozen years for economy reasons and because Pentagon officials had believed the Soviet bomber threat had receded. Among other things the Air 
Force no longer operates EC-121 radar planes which once supplemented the ground-based detection stations. 
Rekindles interest 

But the recent advent of advanced 
Soviet Backfire bombers has helped rekindle the Pentagon’s interest in continental air defense. 
The Air Force is buying some so­ phisticated new Airborne Warning and 
Control planes which, it says, provide the only practical method of tracking low altitude aircraft over extended ar­ eas of sea and land. 
A $2.5 billion Air Force plan to modernize U.S. continental air defenses, including production of modern interceptor aircraft, was prepared late in the Ford administra­ tion and is under study by the Carter administration.

Namibia report is not true 

WASHINGTON (AP) - 
The Associated Press er­ roneously reported 
Thursday that the Carter administration plans to create a $1oo million con- tingeney fund to help 
Namibia swatch to in­ dependence once it is freed by South Africa. 

State Department spo­ kesman nodding Carter said Friday that The AP report was incorrect and the source who supplied the account also acknow­ ledged he was in error. 

Both nodding Carter and the source said the 
$1oo million contingency fund is for Rhodesia in anticipation of transition to black rule. 

John Gilligan, new ad­ ministrator of the Agency for 
International 
Development, announced the fund Friday in tes­ timony before a congres­ sional committee. 

The fund is to provide training, education and economic opportunities for blacks while aiding whites who remain.

NATO’s southeastern flank is vulnerable 

LOS A N G I LES t im e s s e r v ic e 
IZMIR, Turkey - The 
N orth A tlantic T reaty 
Organization's southeas­ tern flank is becoming increasingly vulnerable to Soviet political and m ilitary pressures, top military officials believe here at NATO's regional headquarters. 

They cite the continu­ ing te n sio n s between 
Greece and Turkey, the two regional m em bers. as The principal factor. 
Greece withdrew from all military cooperation within the alliance fol­ 

 lowing the Turkish inva­ sion of Cyprus in 1974. 
Some 2oo Greek officers and men were pulled out of the headquarters, and the Hellenic 1st Army, about 15o.ooo strong, was ta k en away from the com m and of U.S. Gen. 
William A. Knowlton, the c o m m a n d e r at Land- southeast.

This left Know Hon with th re e T u rk ish a rm ie s , to ta llin g som e 4oo,ooo m en, u n d er his c o m ­ m and. 
But a newly cre a te d

T u rk ish 

A rm y, the so-called 
Aegean Army facing the vulnerable Greek islands off the Turkish coast, re­ m ains outside his ju ris­ diction. 

“ I have little connec­ tion now with the Greek a r m y .” Knowlton said recently. 
A nother m a jo r p ro b ­ lem affecting Knowlton^ command arose from the post-1974 congressional a rm s em b arg o ag ain st 
Turkey. It was aggravat­ ed by Washington policy decisions to deemphasize m ilitary g ran t aid, but

Red one-upmanship carries real risks 

Russian long-range bombers flew above a form ation of 
American warships HO miles off the U. S. east coast this week in a continuing ga m e of interna­ tional “ chicken.” 
The R ussian planes — TU 
Bears — are loaded with recon­ naissance gear and apparently intentionally m ade their p r e ­ sence known and im m ediately fled when U. S. fighter aircraft quickly intercepted them. 
The flight w as, at least, a provocative one. 

If the intention was to test U. 
S. early-warning systems, they learned the alert is effective. 
More likely, the flight was de­ signed to irritate and log a re­ connaissance run close to the U. 
S. coast. The planes remained over international waters but 6o miles is merely minutes off the coast and unannounced flights by bombers of foreign air forces pose real dangers. They are le­ gitimate targets for destruction. 

President Carter has said he would announce any m ilitary m a n eu v ers near the R ussian borders. 

U. S. Air F orce reco n n ­ aissance planes have flown ov er the Soviet Union and the old B 17 r eco n n a issa n ce planes have 

 been shot down by the Russians in other years. 
The Pentagon has logged other flights of Russian aircraft near U. S. bases but the record indicates quick and effective re­ sponse by American jet fighters to Soviet intrusions. 
The Russian bombers have been flying into Cuba for at least the past half dozen years. 
American military aircraft are strategically placed in Europe. 
Mutual reconnaissance is an ex­ pected activity. 

But there are risks. 

Negotiations between the U. 
S. and the Soviet Union are 
(dearly in nervous suspension from the center stage but far from dormant. There seem s to be a diplom atic gam e of one- upmanship in progress as a response to President Carter’s barbed remarks about human rights and the Soviet’s pledges in two treaties to honor co m ­ mitments to human rights. 

The new tensions may be a necessary prelude to removing the double-standard definition in Moscow for detente. But the risks of aerial probes of the U. S. air defense zone are real. For-. 
Binately, A m erican response has been quick and effective. 

CBS adopts telecast policy to help thwart terror tactics 

CBS-TV has announced that network will refrain from tele­ casting live coverage of terrorist activities. 
That is a responsible policy. 
The network quite properly reserves its options to decide how it will handle each instance but the guiding policy will be to record the event on videotape, to refrain from allow ing TV r e ­ porters to become actors in the event, to defer to police authori­ ty guidance in making telephone calls to terrorists for purposes of including the conversations in televised coverage. 
CBS recognizes, as we did long ago, that dem onstrations whose purpose is to dom inate public attention can victim ize the press and other media. Con­ versely, the media can decline to be victim ized and, in our 

 judgment, should decline. 
Videotape allows for full co­ verage for later playback with the important advantage of al­ lowing editing. Instant record­ ing of events such as explosive dem onstrations, particularly those staged by terrorists, gives the dem onstrators a sense of having more power than they should be allowed to assume. If they know they are talking into a taped TV show that m ight or might not be shown, they lose the advantage of drama a live telecast might have. 
Radio talk show producers learned early that they couldn’t risk an open, uncontrolled line to the airways. They use a lag of about 12 seconds between talk and its broadcast so that discre­ tion can be ex ercised in the editing process. 

Fiesta celebration a success 

F iesta in San Antonio is winding down and, as usual, the gala has played tag w ith several kinds of weather and came out a winner. 
The festival has involved hundreds of thousands of per­ sons, counting those thousands who lined the parade routes. 
Fam ily clusters, hardy indivi­ d u a lists and assorted pairs turned out in vast numbers and came early. 

The w e e k ’s celebration seem s assured of a successful season and we could discern no lack of enthusiasm despite the wet start. A few events were cancelled or rescheduled but the grand event — the Battle of 
Flowers Parade — had a perfect setting; 
A word of appreciation is due to all those who took part — from the planners to the clean­ up crews. 

The energy solution: First you get his attention... 
Energy vs. speed 

Sir: We have just finished listening to President C arter’s second speech on energy. We have listened carefully, and even listened to the TV com m en­ tators’ comments. 
In all of this, u e have yet to hear 
ONE WORD on the conservation pro­ gram on enforcing the 55-mile speed limit. 
I should like to know why. in view of the fact that the law not only saves gasoline and lives and property, P re ­ sident Carter does not see fit to so much as mention it.

Abortion’s name held irrelevant 

.Sir: In response to Lana Maule (Let­ ters, April 4), abortion is the taking of the life of an innocent, human being. 
Whether this is called “ m u rd er” or not is irrelevant. 

As to when does “ life” begin, 1 11 refer to my previous position (Letters, 
May 22) that “ life” begins at the instant of conception, since a child will be born nine months hence, if normal health of the mother is maintained and nothing is done to preclude the birth. 

Lana Maule’s defense that “ abortion has been used by women . . . for thousands of years” is no defense at all. 
The fact that “ everyone does it” can in no way condone it. 
She seemingly feels that pregnancy and childbirth are in some way unre­ lated. Thus, these two phenom ena should be discussed separately. I be­ lieve this is impossible. 
A woman may not desire to become pregnant, but if she does, the child — and therefore the pregnancy — will not be unwanted. Thousands of childless couples — such as my w ife and I —■ will want it. 
There is most definitely a “ method” which prevents pregnancy — abstin­ ence. The purpose of intercourse is to assure continuation of the human race. 
If this purpose is to be thwarted, it m ust be done in refraining from per­ forming the initial act. 
We may rationalize subsequent ac­ tions to prevent childbirth, but that is all they are — rationalizations. 
To put it bluntly, if you want. to dance, you must pay the piper.

The title of the article would be better if “ A m ericans” were substitut­ ed for “ Europeans” and the last word would be better if you would cut off the

Then have the AP do an article to comply with the new' title.

‘Being able to bowl right here in the White House is really fun — particularly when I’M WINNING!’ 
High treason is forgivable 

WASHINGTON - It is a least consistent that the Carter 
Adm inistration should have brushed CIA defector Philip 
Agee with the wings of for­ giveness. 

A fter all, the a d m in is tra tio n is p ro c la im in g abso lu tio n for e v e ry ' raunchy m ilitary crim in al and d e ­ serter. 

To refresh your recollection of this squalid case, Agee is the cashiered 
CIA officer w ha — by his own a d ­ m ission in co llab o ratio n with the 
Cuban and possibly other Communist intelligence services — has m ade a good thing out of systematically ex­ po sin g U.S. in te llig e n c e s o u rc e s, methods and personnel. 

Damaging expose 

Besides au th o rin g his highly d a ­ m a g in g CIA ex p o s e , “ In sid e th e 
Com pany,” which in 1975 identified by nam e and function more than 2oo 

CIA officers and agents abroad, Agee served as ad v iser to Fifth E state- whose magazine, “ Counter Spy” fin­ gered Richard Welch, our CIA station served as adviser to Fifth Estate— murdered in 1975 by terrorists* 

Afraid to return home for fear of well-deserved prosecution, Agee has lived in England since 1972. 

But he is now in process of being deported from that country at the instance of MIS, B ritain’s countere­ spionage service, proceeding against 
Agee and a U.S. jo u rn a list. M arc 
Hosenball, who, like Agee, has made a s p e c ia lty of e x p o sin g non-Commun'ist intelligence o p e ra ­ tions. 

No grounds 

Now, in the person of Benjamin R. 
Civilette, new head of the Criminal 
Division at the Justice Departm ent, the a d m in is tra tio n h as in fo rm ed 
Agee's lawyer, Ram sey Clark, that the government can find no grounds 

 under the Espionage Act to prosecute what in any other jurisdiction — de­ m o c ra tic B rita in , for ex a m p le — would be an open-and-shut case of high treason. 

Philip Agee, the attorney general says, can come home. 

T hat the cre ak y E sp io n ag e Act, despite its ferocious title, is toothless insofar as Philip Agee is concerned need cause no surprise. 

Politics. 

Radical lawyers and liberal judges have over the y ea rs shredded this legislation into an ineffectual pulp. 

What is surprising — and certainly indicative of the politics behind the 
Agee m inistry — is that the attorney general should have chosen to weigh the Agee decision only within the n a rro w an d flaw ed focus of the 
Espionage Act. 

The fact, well known to g o v ern ­ m ent law yers in the case, is that, while probably able to wriggle past the Espionage Act, Agee clearly vio­ lated another criminal statute — one with sharp teeth — which protects the technical security of a certain cate­ gory of information of the kind Agee knowingly disclosed. 
Rare comment 
In o th e r w ords, the J u s tic e D e­ p artm e n t, in d eliberately lim iting consideration of the m atter to a law which would be ineffectual, while ig­ noring one that could send Agee to prison, gave him a free run. 

This is the reason a GIA spokes­ man, in a rare on-record com ment, especially over another government ag e n c y ’s (if not W hite House) d e­ 

 cision, said CIA — as well it might be 
— w as “ u p s e t” at w hat had h a p ­ pened. 

Besides being upset, the mildest possible categorization, the A m eri­ can public ought to see this deplora­ ble transaction not in the individual te rm s of flagrantly (and seemingly intentionally) unpunished betrayal, but b ecau se it once ag ain d em o n ­ strates that the nation has no ad e­ quate general law' for the protection of intelligence sources and methods of unauthorized disclosure. 

Legislation 

President Ford, at the prom pting of former Director of Central Intelli­ gence William Colby, last year pro­ posed le g isla tio n to th is p u rp o se 
(though in no way c o m p a ra b le to 
Britain’s stiff Official Secrets Act). 

To date, Congress and the Carter a d m in is t r a tio n have ig n o re d the 
Ford-Colby proposal. 

Welcome home, Philip Agee.

Inflation hits vote-buying power 

Sir: When I was a young man Round 
Steak was 23 cents per pound, bread cost five cents a loaf. milk was IO cents 
'a quart and it cost a politician one dollar to buy a vote. 

Local political hacks would round up a group of men. take them to the polling places, tell them how to vote 
;iind then pay them one dollar for each vote. 

Today, however, inflation bas hit us all 
Cost of m any item s have soared hut none so much as the cost of a vote. 
Today, those politicians have moved to 
Washington and, to get the vote of “ the man on the street.” are now proposing that each one be sent a G OVERN­ 
MENT check for $5o. They don’t even use their own money. They use ours. 

Inflation? What is the end? 
Lee Moffett 

Congress, public opinion take over 

WASHINGTON — President 
Carter has had his say on the energy crisis, and the issue now moves to the political cockpit of 
Congress, with its new leader­ ship, and to the arena of public opinion. 
Here there lsgeneralagreem entabout the P re s id e n ts ends and a tangle of disagreem ents about his means. 
On the whole, the President is given good m arks on Capitol Hill for d ra m a ­ tizing the energy problem, for putting it to the nation in the conviction that he m ust serve the truth and not opinion, and for trying to do what he thinks is rig h t, w h eth er or not he is su re to succeed. 
But there are some honest and even violent doubts here, and the Congress is obviously not going to agree with him that this is simply “ a m atter of patriotism and com m itm ent.” 
Unconvinced 
Many m e m b ers, for exam ple, are still unconvinced about the mevitabili- tv of the disaster C arter fears 
‘ They note that he is asking for un­ precedented measures, but also that he seems a little unsure himself about the factual base on which his fears a re founded. 
“ If we are asking sacrifices of our­ se lv es,” he told the C ongress, “ we need facts we can count on. W’e need an independent inform ation system that. will give us reliable data about energy reserves and production, em ergency capabilities and financial d ata from the energy p ro d u ce rs.” 
But he put forward Ids program without that “ in­ dependent" data. 
Difference 
O th er m e m b e rs of C o n g ress feel th e re was a s u b s ta n tia l d iffe re n ce betw een the m elody of C a rte r ’s a d ­ dress to the nation on Monday and his speech to the Congress on Wednesday. 
On Monday, he sounded like Winston 
Churchill on the eve of the Battle of 
B rita in . He w as ta lk in g ab o u t “ a p ro b le m u n p re c e d e n te d in o u r h is ­ tory.” 
If we fail to act soon, he said, “ we will face an economic, social and poli­ tical crisis that will threaten our free institutions.” 
The alternative to his energy policy, he insisted, “ m ay be a national catas­ trophe.” 
Still solemn 
But on Wednesday, before the Con­ gress, while still solemn, he was less apocalyptic, and even suggested that his program would “ protect, jobs, our en v iro n m en t, our national in d ep en ­ dence, our standard of living, and our future.” 
In s h o rt, th e o fficia l co n clu sio n seem ed to be, not that the sacrifices w ould be a h a rs h b u rd e n on the 
A m e ric a n p eople, or c h a n g e th e ir styles of life very m uch, but that it would c r e a te m o re w ork, in c re a s e 
GNP, and raise the inflation rate by only o.4 percentage points. 
All this, of co u rse, is being c h a l­ lenged in the Congress. 
Controversy 
So the controversy remains, but the sc e n e an d th e c a s t of c h a r a c t e r s change. 
Now it is not only the new President but the new leaders of the Congress who will be tested. 
Jim m y Carter has been so prom in­ ent in these last three months that it has been easy to forget that we now have new Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate, a new speaker and majority leader in the House, a lot of new rules, and a lot of new m em bers in the H ouse, a lm o s t half of th e m under 4o. 
The question now is whether the De­ m ocrats downtown and the Democrats on the Hill can get together and govern 
—• as they insisted they could do in the presidential cam paign — and m uch will depend on how Speaker O'Neill in the House and Senate Majority Leader 
B yrd m a n a g e th e ir new responsibilities. 
Suggestion 

Byrd suggested in a talk with this reporter that what we need now is a reflective pause to sort out all these changes. 
“ My first concern,” he said, “ is that we d on’t start shooting holes in the 
P resident’s proposals before we even study it, and that’s going on already. 
“ This disturbs m e,” he said. “ It’s a very c o m p re h e n s iv e and co m p lex package. We’ve got to cost these things out. I w an t to run these assumptions from the W hite House th ro u g h the com puters and see how the cost effi­ ciency factors come through. 
“ We may disagree with certain parts of the P r e s id e n t’s package, but I don’t think any of us should rush in to em ­ brace ail this IOO per cent or to criticize them too fast.” 
Byrd said much would depend in the 
Congress not only on the leaders but un the com m ittee chairm en who will be dealing with energy bills. 
Alternatives 

“ Whenever we criticize or am end the President’s program ,” Byrd said, 
“ we are going to have to come up with some alternatives because the respon­ sibility is going to be on us, and this whole energy problem is so insidious. 
“ It .is hidden. Our real danger lies ahead. I f s a good bit like a fellow w ho’s w alk in g aro u n d and looking well, but has a ca n c e r and d o e s n ’t realize it until the pain strikes.’’

Gay, defrocked minister now homosexual leader 

KICKED out of the church because of his homosexuality, 
Gene Leggett takes his ministry to the street people. 
STAFF P H O TO BY S T tv f CAMPBEII 

There was a time when par­ ents hoped their little Bill would grow up like Gene Leggett -- a leader in his class, valedictor­ ian, Methodist m inister. 
Those sam e parents would m ake a quick ab o u t face now — w ithout a glance back for fear of the lengthening shadows of some Dodom or Gomorrah. 
Leggett has told the world he's a practicing homosexual. 
His m etam orphosis from a minister with a family to a leader in the gay community transpired over the last 12 years. 
“ In 1965,1 was living in a parsonage, doing the m in is te r trip — except I acknowledged that my homosexuality was a night-tim e sexual thing,” Leg­ gett explains. 
Focal point 
Now the night-tim e sex thing has become a focal point in his life. 
And, th e re ’s been the devil to pay. It got him booted from the church. Di­ vorced. But, he’d look you in the eye and tell you he’s never been happier. 
“ Many people live a double life. I 

 just know that it is terribly difficult and it was impossible for m e .” 
Bearded and stylishly-coiffed, Leg­ g e tt is a hip -lo o k in g 4 2-year-old. 
D ressed in jeans, his cotton shirt is unbuttoned enough to reveal a silver cross pendant resting on his chest. 
A pierced earring is in his right ear. 
What does it mean? "N othing,” he says. “ Nothing.” 
Cottonwood Club 
Leggett is one of the founders of San 
Antonio’s Cottonwood Club, a political organization pushing for a civil rights ordinance to protect the housing and jobs of homosexuals. 

L eg g e tt also sa y s h e ’s a so cial worker for “ feminine-identified” boys. 
Street kids. 
S e v era l of th e te en -ag e boys he knows saunter over to the restaurant booth during the interview to say hello. 
Leggett’s face is obviously familiar at the downtown cafe that’s reminiscent of a 195os ham burger hangout. 
A stranger also walks up and hands the rep o rter a “ Don’t Show This to 
H im ” note before scu ttlin g out the door into the yellowed late evening sun. 
‘Con artist’ 
The note id e n tifies the m an as a father and a g ran d fath er, who over­ heard the conversation. “ If you think I would send them (my kids and grand­ a d s ) to him, when he is the greatest con a rtist I ever heard using G od’s 
Shadow then you are crazy.” 
Leggett would probably say the note is an indication of the oppression the gay community faces. 
“ People are so sexually uptight," he says. “ You don’t have to em brace m y lifestyle to accept me as a human be­ ing.” 
Carter joins school racism case 

WASHINGTON (AP) - The C arter a d m in is tra tio n u rged th e S u p re m e 
Court, on Friday to uphold a sweeping desegregation order for Dayton, Ohio, public schools that would m ak e neces­ sary the busing of 15,ooo students. 
A brief subm itted to th e co u rt by 
Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell said the Justice 
D epartm ent had found 
“ pervasive racial discrimination with persistent 

 effects” in the Dayton school system 

The court alread y has d ecid ed to review a ruling by the Sixth U.S. C ir­ cuit C ourt of A ppeals th a t each of

“ Given a choice between m aintain­ ing the hospital’s past standards while operating at a loss, or of cutting back, the hospital adm inistrator will actually have very little choice,” Dr. Sammons said. 
A c c o rd in g to one c o n g re s s io n a l so u rce , the P re s id e n t’s proposal is bound to run into trouble on Capitol 
Hill and if passed is likely to be sub­ stantially changed. 
As for th e m e s s a g e t h a t w ill accom pany the proposed legislation. 

 the P resident will allude to the need for national health insurance but he will announce no specifics. His con­ cept, w hich he endorsed d u rin g the presidential campaign, is believed to be at least a year away from being introduced, and possibly longer. 

The Carter bill, which is entitled the 
H o sp ita l C o n ta in m e n t A ct of 1977 would attem pt to restrain hospital cost increases in the short run by limiting hospital revenue increases to a figure several percentage points higher than the inflation rate.

“ A person who rep a irs a wrecked truck or car can get an affidavit from the police departm ent that it is legal for a him to have a new title ,” the policeman said. 
“ So w hat reportedly has been hap­ pening is that som e affid av its have been signed for stolen, not w recked vehicles,” he said. 
“ My superior officer told m e there is supposed to have been m ore than IOO blank affid av its signed by one p e r­ son.” 

One car dealer said he stands to lose at least six ca rs he purchased from another dealer believed implicated in the thefts. 
“ Top price was paid for these cars; there was no hanky panky. I had no idea they m ight be hot until they cam e and towed them away,” he said. 
Another dealer reportedly m ay lose 
$8o,ooo or more, the Express-News was told. 
The bank employe reportedly was fired last Monday after there were se­ veral inquiries about titles of cars he had appproved loans for. 
The titles in some cases involved stolen c a rs , the E xpress-N ew s was told.

As the parade progressed, colored um brellas went up to shield viewers from the glaring sun and the crowd bulged out into the street during lapses as children stretched th e ir necks to catch a glimpse of an oncoming float or band. 
P aren ts lifted their children up so they could see over the heads of others who stood in anticipation of the rest of the parade. 
If som e of the float rid ers seemed more ebullient than others, you could p ro b ab ly see a b rig h t p rize ribbon hanging prominently on the float.

It is highly unusual for an attorney general to file a Justice Department 
•brief with the court. That job usually falls to the solicitor general, the go­ vernm ent’s top courtroom lawyer. 

Newly appointed Solicitor G eneral 
Wade McCree. until recently a judge in the Sixth Circuit, disqualified himself from the case, and Justice Department spokesmen explained that Bell felt the important policy statem ent should be filed over the signature of a highrank­ ing official. 
•P resid en t C a r t e r ’s n o m in a tio n of 
Bell as attorney general was severely criticized by some black leaders and civil rig h ts activ ists for w h at they charged was Bell’s less-than-inspiring record in school desegregation cases as a judge. 
‘ 
Bell's 42-page brief received by the court late in the afternoon said he did 

 n i t agree with the specific re a so n s used by the appeals court to rule that discrim ination existed. But he said, 
“ other facts of record establish th a t 
Dayton has for a long tim e o p e r a te d one set of schools primarily for whites and another set primarily for blacks.” 
Handed down 
T he Sixth C irc u it d e s e g r e g a tio n order was handed down last Ju ly 26, more than four years after a group of 
Dayton parents and the National As­ so ciatio n for the A d v a n c e m e n t of 
Colored People sued the city ’s school board. 
The Dayton board of education has asked the Supreme Court to overturn that order. 
The order’s definition of desegrega­ tion is a black-white student population that reflects within 15 per cent plus or m inus the racial com position of the 

 whole district. 
In appealing to the nation’s highest court, the school board said, “ A forced busing plan can be expected to drive whites and middle-class blacks out of the sy ste m , le a v in g b eh in d a low econom ic, p r e d o m in a n tly b la c k student population.” 
Confusion 
Although there was initial confusion as to why the Supreme Court agreed to review the Dayton school case, recent indications given by the justices m ade it appear the court would use this case to review a 1973 decision it handed down in a c a se in v o lv in g e n v e r schools. 
In th at d ec isio n , th e c o u rt g a v e federal judges the power to order dis­ trict-wide rem edies when intentional discrimination in school system s had been proved. 

He ad m its, how ever, h o m o sex u al issues are political hot potatoes. 
“ Conservatives think we’re too sin­ ful. Liberals think w e're too co n tro ­ versial.” 
In d iv id u a l m e m b e r s of th e C ity 
Council, he says, have given them a warm reception. “ But, as far as being a public advocate, they’re afraid .” 

Leggett is articulate. He looks you straight in the eye when he talks. 
He says. he gets tired of having to explain his homosexuality. 
Expulsion evil 

“ My explusion from the church is an evil in itself.” 
Evil? 

“ On the basis of a label they have 
.refused to recognize me as a person and treat m e as a person," explains the man who’s tried to get back in the ministry annually since his expulsion in 1971. 

“ I aip a Wesleyan M ethodist. . . it s re a lly th e c h u rc h and th e k in d of training they gave me that m ade m e what I am today,” Leggett says. 
“ I am in the church already. I want to revolutionize it. I want to change it.” 
Human sexuality 

“ How? I’m interested in the church coming to term s with itself in term s of human sexuality.” 
It took Leggett him self a while to come to term s with his own sexualtiy. 
He denied his homosexuality for years, he says. 

Leggett grew up in a sm all Texas town where he was a leader in school. 
He m arried his hometown sweetheart. 
“ I was the typical hometown success story,” he says with a shrug. 
But that died when his homosexuali­ ty was uncovered. 

Sometimes, Leggett says, people ask him if his fife wouldn’t have been ea­ sier if he w'ere heterosexual — faced only with heterosexual problems. 
He sh ru g s. “ I look aro u n d and I don’t see other people any happier than 
I am .”

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Saturday April 23 1977 
Kenny Rogers and fgirls9 head to S.A. 

K E N N Y R O G ER S 
. . . coming to town 

By W ILEY A L E X A N D E R 

Ruby took her love to town and 
Lucille picked a fine time to leave him, but Kenny Rogers is elated by it. 

Ruby, of course, is the star of the 
4-million seller by Rogers, “ Ruby, 
Don’t Take Your Love to Town,” and 
Lucille is Rogers' latest smash in 
“ You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me, 
Lucille.” 
Rogers, relaxing in his Arkansas motel room, said he believes Lucille will outsell Ruby. “ Lucille is number one on the Country-Western charts.” 

Rogers said, “ and is the 28th best­ selling record in the world.” 
This will make Kenny Rogers one of the nation’s hottest entertainers by the time he hits San Antonio for his Turtle 
( reek Country Flub performances 
Wednesday through Saturday nights. 
Rogers will join Anne Murray in the 
Turtle Creek doubleheader. 

“ I’m looking forward to being with 
Anne," Rogers said. “ She's a great entertainer and even recorded a couple of songs I wrote," he said. referring to 
“ Stranger in My Place” and “ Sweet 
Music Man.” 
“ I like the four-day arrangement with Turtle Creek.” Rogers continued, 
“ because it gives me time to rehearse 

 new material and really put on a good show. 
“ I have time to relax and be at my best because I don't have a plane to catch immediately after the show . 
“ This will be my first appearance in 
San Antonio since hitting it big,” 
Rogers said, “ and I'm anxious to make a good impression. ITI also be working on a new album while in San Antonio.” 
Rogers, who has been in the enter­ tainment field ever since graduating from Jeff Davis High School in Hous­ ton in 1956. has had four movie offers since “ Lucille” hit the charts and has guest appearances lined up on the 
Tonight Show, the Dinah Shore show and the Merv Griffith show. 
Things happen fast and quick in this 

 business,” Rogers said. “ It’s like a roller-coaster, with some ups and a lot of dow ns. 
“ I’m a business man,” he said, “ and 
I ’ve made some good investments so I won’t have to worry when my roller-coaster goes down.” 
Rogers started his career with (he 
Bobby Doyle 3 group, playing all the major clubs in the Houston area. 
“ We became the best-paid of the lo­ cal entertainers in Houston,” Rogers said, “ but I knew that if I ever wanted to make it big, I had to leave my ho­ metown. 
“ I joined the New Christy Minstrels in 19H8. stayed with them for almost two years, and then started the First 
Edition,” he said. 

Then, things started happening for 
Kenny Rogers. Along came his first big hit. “ I Just Dropped In to See What 
Condition My Condition’s In,” and things have been zooming ever since. 
People of all ages are listening to 
Kenny Rogers songs. 
Even teen-agers are buying “ You 
Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me, Lu­ cille.” 
“ More and more teen-agers are turning to Country-Western music,” 
Rogers said. “ They’re seeking a relief from the noise of rock-and-roll. 
“ I ’m hoping to shake a lot of teen­ age hands during my four days in San 
Antonio.” Rogers said. 
Especially if their names are Ruby and Lucille.

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturdoy April 23 1977 

Small town landmarks 

The U.S. flag goes up over the post office at 
Hochheim, right. Raising the flag is Chester Laufer, w ho w as postm aster for 
33 years. His supervisor for flag-raising cere­ m o n ie s is his g r a n d ­ d a u g h te r, 
3 -y e a r -o ld 
W en d y Daniels. 

A t left is Hoch’s heim 
—— Hoch’s hom e — - from which the town of Hoch­ heim drew its name. V a ­ le n tin e 
Hoch sta rte d building this m arve lo u s hom e in I 856. It w as also a sta ge stop on the In- dianola-Austin road. 
Hochheim nestled in riot o f wildflowers 

V alentine Hoch bought land in Texas without see­ ing it. 
He had not been within 3,ooo miles of it. A land agent made the sale at Hoch’s home in Al­ sace-Lorraine. 
This was in the early 185os. 
But if Hoch had traveled all across the U.S., he could not have found more beautiful land than this he bought sight unseen. 
What a pity Hoch could not have seen it in the bright sunshine of two Satur­ days ago! 
On the way to the home he built more than 12o years ago, the bluebonnets, 
Indian paintbrushes and delicate pink buttercups were all along the roadside. 
Breathtaking 

A field acro ss the highw ay was b re a th ta k in g in its m ix tu re of the 
T exas blue of bluebonnets and the green of the tender grass of spring. 

Phot** by B o n ita A arm rn* Ii 

Once Bonnie and I flew from Florida to Cuba. Looking down on the emerald green water of the Caribbean, we could see the shadow-like patchwork quilt of the coral reefs below the surface. That field brought back the sweet memories of that sea. 
The pasture beside the little gravel road leading to Hoch’s house was an unbroken carpet of bluebonnets. 
And down at the end of the road, we stopped in awe as we looked through the leafy framing of a limb of a giant oak across to a great hillside. The solid green of the grassy slope was dotted by 

 by white cows. And even w hiter the calves slept the sleep of innocent near their mothers. 
Valentine Hoch left his name on this wonderful country. Its town is Hoch­ heim. 
This is German and means “ Hoch’s home.’’ 
Hochheim (pronounced “ Ho-hime” ) is in the cen ter of the base of the 
Gonzales-Yoakum-Cuero triangle. 

Bonnie and I spent a day we will long rem em ber at Hocheim and the nearby community of Hochheim Prairie. 

Spending the day in Hocheim was not our plan. 
Our plan was to visit and write about four of the fine old German commun­ ities in the area — Hocheim, Lindenau, 
Arneckeville and Meyersville. 
But what happened is typical of our wanderings over Texas. The first place we visited had such an appealing story we never got beyond it. 
So some day we will have to go to the other three towns. 
And in those towns we know we will find as friendly, helpful people as 
C hester Laufer, Mr. and Mrs. H. L. 
Jaeger and half a dozen others in Ho­ cheim. 
When Bonnie and I go to a sm all town to do a story, we usually go first to the post office. This particularly seem ed the thing to do as we drove down the street in Hochheim and saw the post office sign. 
In contrast to some of the new homes on the street, this was an old-time building with a front of crinkly gray tin and a long, slatted wooden bench on each side of its wide doorway. In a 

 k>- i f * fern fit- 
* ^.*1 ary. 

 front window was a torn sign that once said: 
“ T his sto re will be closed every 
Wed. N ile-so you can go to prayer m eeting.” 
The inside surpassed the outside. 
Scattered all about — and no longer for sale — was a jum ble of all sorts of items. On rickety old shelves were jar after ja r of preserves — here were cans of shoe polish — spools of thread were spilled out on a crowded table — 

 just nam e it and it was bere som e­ where. 
In one of the rooms at the back, a man was talking over short-wave ra­ dio. A sign said this was K5-RKW. 
The operator ended his conversation and met us with a friendly smile. He was Chester Laufer, postm aster for 33 years until his retirem ent in 1973. Mrs. 
Laufer is now acting postmaster.

The glass barriers are 
NOT designed to prevent you from getting at the food, officials at the San 
Antonio Metropolitan 
Health District huffed, when we asked them about the law requiring the guards. “ This law is not antique. It was re­ commended by the U.S. 
Public Health office,” we were told. 
We have observed peo­ ple fighting, stumbling and generally contorting themselves to try to get past the 
“ health shields." And, frequent­ ly. as you mentioned, people would spill their food into the buffet or drag their sleeve or cuff through some of the food. 
A lot of people simply try to ignore the shield 

 and get down under it so they can see what they are getting. 
Now', do you want to know what this amazing device is supposed to protect the food from? 
Well, it isn't paint chips and flakes from the ceiling. It is a cough and sneeze guard. 
City health officials ex­ plained that only per­ manently installed soup and salad bars require the cough and sneeze guards. 
This means that res­ taurants. for example, which have salad bars or buffet lines only one day a week or hotels which have buffet lines at catered events do not have to have the sneeze guards. 

Exit policy 

My teen-aged daughter recently attended a rock concert at Municipal Auditorium. 
She and her date had to leave to go home. 
However, when they attempted to exit they were told by the guard that no one is permitted to leave before the end of the concert. 
What kind of a policy is this? 
Is this legal? Shouldn’t they tell you about this before you go in'.' 
o. G. J. 

Well, there was a mis­ understanding there. 
According to the manager of the Munici­ pal Auditorium, there is no policy that prohibits people from leaving be­ fore the end of the con­ cert. 

There IS a policy that prohibits people from leaving and then return­ ing a short time later with their ticket stubs. 
“ If we allow this prac­ tice, we will have dozens of people going in and out and the guards will get confused about who had 

 and who didn't have stubs. That way. people can let their friends in on a stub and then come back later themselves and tell the guard they lost the stubs.” 
The guard apparently thought your daughter was trying to leave and then come back later. 
Concert-goers should be aware of this policy. 
However, if you really want to leave and can’t get out, ask to see the building manager. There is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to leave if you want to. 

Tall lower 

What is taller, the Tower of the Americas or the smokestack on the new coal plant operated by C ity 
Public Service? 
JOU M. 

The stack itself is over 
7oo feet tail. The Tower of the Americas by itself is 
622 feet tall. 

However, the television antenna atop the tower makes it 75o feet tall. 
But a particle collector or some such gadget atop 

 the smokestack makes it taller than that. 
Ail this will be moot, however, if Southwestern 
Bel! decides to finish its building at Navarro and 
Martin streets. Accord­ ing to the original plans, it would be over 8oo feet tall when completed. 

E n e rg y p la n 

Can you tell me if President Carter's energy plan includes a high tax on older cars? 
Some <»| these big cars are the worst gas guzzlers but a lot of folks can’t afford to buy new cars because the prices are going up every year. 
What about these people who have invested their lite savings in a good car and now have to pay thousands of dollars to keep it?

Salad bar guards 

Can you find out what person or persons are responsible for the city laws which require res­ taurants lo put plastic awnings or hoods over their salad and buffet bars? 
They seem to serve no purpose but to frustrate people trying to get at the food. They hit t he glass or plastic, they get their sleeves in the food, they spill food off their plates from leaning over — all in all it would seem that whatever antiquated reasoning is behind the presence of these unattractive and clumsy attachments, they are more of a nuisance than a help. 
Best I can figure it is some strange custom started when a buffet was located under the ceiling in some restaurant where the paint was loose and someone got some paint flakes in the buffet. 
I am sure whatever else it is supposed to do is not as serious as dragging your sleeve th rough the food because you can’t get at it — thanks to the glass barrier. 
FRUSTRATED 

At this time, the only taxes being proposed on gas-guzzling cars are to be imposed on new cars, not used ones. 

The push seems to be 

 to encourage auto makers to make more economical cars by forc­ ing people to buy more economical cars or pay a much higher price for them. 

Canal talks resume Mav 9 

 w a s h in g t o n po st service 
WASHINGTON - The next round of U.S.-Pana­ ma negotiations over the future of the Panama 
Canal will begin May 9 in 
Washington, State De­ partment officials said 
Friday. 

The previous series of talks ended Feb. 22 with no agreement on the ma­ jor questions of a date for termination of a new canal treaty and guar­ antees of open access to the waterway after Pan­ ama takes full charge.

By George C. 
Thosteson, M.D. 

Club for widows fine idea 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: This is in reply to a letter you received from Mrs. L.R., which appeared in the local paper. 
She was a widow who admitted to overeating due to nervous tension, and said she had gained weight. 
In your reply you recommended relief from tensions by group with mutual interests and problems, but you said you didn t know of any such groups speci­ fically for widows. 

This is to let you know we have a very active group in the Dayton, 
Ohio, area called W i­ dows and Widowers Fel­ lowship of the Greater 
Miami Valley Area, Inc. 
We meet once a month and have a covered-dish card party every third 
Friday of the month. We howl once a week and have other social out­ ings. Twice a month we have a rap session in someone’s home. 

It is not a lonely hearts club, but was estab­ lished to help the wi­ dowed overcome their grief and be able to go out socially without a partner. We’re non-partisan and non-deniominutional. — Mrs. CLC. 
Good for you and for the widowed in your area. I ani sure other similar groups exist in other cities. I suppose a local church would be able to locate one for other persons interested. Thank you for passing on the information. I think it’s a great idea. 
Pounding in ears 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I have been bothered lately with a pounding in my left ear like a heart beat. It occurs after I take a bath, when I am wiping cabinet doors, and in other mild activities. I am 64, and according to my neurologist I have semi-Parkin- sonism. I am taking Benadryl. Is this pounding in my ear serious? — Mrs. BTI. 
Well, ifs certainly not a normal condition. Bena­ dryl (diphenhydramine), which is helpful in Par­ kinsonism, can cause palpitations of the heart and vertigo. Activity would increase the heart rate and blood pressure, either of which may add to the problem. Better report your symptoms. Possibly a lower-dose vvould be sufficient to help your Parkin­ sonism. 
G.I. exam 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: Can you explain the differ­ ence between an upper G.I. examination and a lower one? — TK. 
I presume you are referring to X-ray studies with barium, a common procedure. 
In the upper G.I. (gastrointestinal) study the patient drinks a barium “ cocktail.” The X-ray then provides a clear outline of the gullet, stomach and small bowel. In the lower tract examination the barium is administered as an enema. The patient holds this in long enough for the X-rays to be taken of the lower tract (large bowel). The barium pro­ vides a convenient “ background” against which the structures stand out more in contrast clearly on the 
X-ray plate. 

Are you bothered with ringing in the ears? lf so, write to Dr. 
Thosteson, in core of this newspaper, for his booklet, "Ear Noises 
— Their Causes and Cures." Enclose a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope and 25 cents.

 new YORK TIMM S H V ICE 
NEW YORK — A Mississippi woman filed a copyright-infringem ent suit against Alex Haley in Federal Court here Friday charging that large por­ tions of his acclaimed book “ Roots” has been copied from her 1966 novel about black people in Georgia during the Civil War era. 
At the sam e time, another writer, the author of a 1967 novel about an 
African brought to the United States as a slave, said that he had noted num er­ ous sim ilarities of them e, structure and language between “ Roots” and his own out-of-print book. 
Haley was out of town and unavaila­ ble for com m ent, but his literary agent. Paul R. Reynolds; his editor, 
Elizabeth Drew; and a spokesman for his publisher all scoffed at the sug­ gestions of plagiarism. 
“ The book is original and is Ha­ ley’s," said Reynolds. “ He hasn’t been copying anybody.” 
H aley’s phenom enally successful book has sold more than 1.5 million copies since its appearance last fall, and has been made into a television series that attracted one of the greatest viewing audiences in history. 
Controversy 
But while it has brought fame and wealth to its author, “ Roots” has been the su b ject of c o n sid erab le c o n tro ­ versy. On April IO, The Sunday Times of London reported that an investiga­ tion had raised num erous questions over the factual basis of the African portion of his account of his ancestors’ journey from freedom in what is now 
Gambia to slavery in America. 

Haley has conceded that parts of the book were fictionalized, but he denied m aking any errors knowingly and has defended the book as “ a symbolic his­ tory of a people.” 
T he c o p y rig h t in frin g e m e n t su it filed here Friday charged that Haley had “ largely copied” unspecified por­ tions of a novel called “ Jubilee.” Its author, the suit’s plaintiff, is M argaret 
Walker Alexander of Jackson, Miss., the director of the black studies de­ partm ent at Jackson State College. 
Miss Alexander, whose suit nam ed 
Doubleday & Company, the publisher of “ R oots” , and Haley as co-defen­ dants, asked the United States Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin further sale of the best seller an d to o r d e r th a t sh e be g iven an unspecified share of the profits it has earned thus far. 
“Jubilee” 
She described “ Jubilee” as a novel based on the true story of her g re a t­ grandm other. She said that it depicted black life in Georgia before, during and after the Civil War. 
Reynolds, the literary agent for Ha­ ley, said of the suit. “ This is perfect nonsense, in my opinion.’’ 
Miss Drew , tie Doubleday editor w ho handled “ Roots,” called the suit the 
“ most ridiculous thing" she has heard of. And Kenneth McCormick, editor- in-chief of Doubleday, who had worked with Halev in the early stages of the book, said, “ In my working with Ha­ ley, I found that his research was al­ most entirely from old documents. I didn’t hear him refer to other books he m ight have read.”

HOCH LEFT TOWN LEGACY 

Continued from Page IB 

 merchandise store run by J. P. Kelley, who started it about HO years ago,” 
Laufer said. ‘‘There was a drug store, doctor’s office, meat m arket, farm tools, dry goods — you know the old- time high, button shoes and that sort of thing. 
‘‘I was a radio operator in World 
War II. I had my money sent home and 
I had $3,3oo when I got back. I bought the store.” 
When we told Laufer we were inter­ ested in Hochheim history, he rum ­ maged around in some drawers and came up with three fading, white-on- black pages. 
This was a reproduction of an article in “ The Junior H istorian" of many years ago. 
Its title was “ Hochheim, The Home of the H ochs.” The author was “ Eva 
Janet Weber. Cuero High School.” She identified herself as the great-great- granddaughter of Valentine Hoch. 
She got her material from Mrs. B M. 
Pittm an, the last living grandchild of 
Valentine Hoch. Mrs. Pittm an's hus­ band, Boone Pittm an, still lives in 
Hochheim. 
W rote story 
.Back in San Antonio we called a friend in Cuero who told us Eva Janet 
Weber was now' Mrs. Don Smith and on the staff of the Farmers State Bank at 
Cuero. 
“ That story was written in 1946 or 
1947,” Mrs. Smith said. ‘‘And how proud I was that I was paid $1o for it.” 
“ It was in his home in southern 
G erm any that Valentine Hoch had bought the land in De Witt County, 
3,ooo miles away in the frontier state of 
T ex as,” the g reat-great-grand- daughter wrote. 
“Sight unseen, he purchased it from one of the land agents sent over to the old country to bring in new settlers.” 
But a double tragedy hit before the family was to arrive at its new home­ land. There were four children and just before the family left Germany, the baby became sick and died. And the mother was torn by grief on the long sea voyage to the port of Indiano­ la. 
“ Heartbroken she died as the ship anchored on the Texas coast,” Mrs. 
Smith wrote. “ As there was no place to buy a casket, Valentine Hoch made a wooden box in which to bury his wife at 
Indianola.” 

Details have varied in reports of the coming of the Hochs to Texas. One report was Mrs. Hoch died and was buried at sea. 
“ I am convinced that the article I wrote 3o years ago is accurate,” Mrs. 
Smith said. “ Not only did I talk at length with Mrs. Pittm an, a grand­ daughter, but her mother —a daughter of Valentine Hoch — was present and she added her personal knowledge.” 
“ With his three rem aining chil­ dren,” the article continued, “Valen­ tine journeyed on to the present site of 
Hochheim. When the lonely German traveler came to the rolling hills and wooded valleys of this uninhabited spot, he is said to have pulled his old gray horse to a halt and said to his son: 
“ ’August, here we shall build our home.’” 
It took more than a year to build the house from stone quarried by hand and hauled to the site by a donkey. Even the lime had to be made" by burning rock and wood together and sifting the ashes. 
We could not have had more knowing or more lively guides to Hochheim than Mr. and Mrs. H. L: Jeager. The 
Jeagers run a combined gasoline sta­ tion. repair garage and general store. 
Town tour 
It is a center of community life. In a town of no more than IOO people, Mrs. 
Jeager sold 96o auto license stickers this year. Jeager went with us on our swing around Hochheim. 
We went to the Hoch home — driving along the road bordered by those m ar­ velous fields of bluebonnets; They stretched until they faded in a blue haze atop distant hills. 
The roadside plaque gives another angle of the house’s history: 
“STAGECOACH INN. . . served as an inn on Austin-Indianola stage road. 
While drivers changed their four-horse team s, passengers welcomed the chance to enjoy inn and hospitality.” 
The Hoch home is not open to the public and we saw it only from the outside. But what a beautiful two-story stone house it is! And we thought of the several generations of Hochs who lived there and what they have meant to 
Texas. 
The home is now owned by Ross 
Boothe Jr. of Gonzales. We talked with 
Boothe after our return to San Antonio. 
Boothe’s grandparents, who owned adjoining land, bought the Hoch home in 1899. 

Boothe restored the home in 1954. 
The restoration won a San Antonio 
Conservation Society Award, a Texas 
Restoration Award and carries a Texas 
Historical Medallion. 
Boothe made every effort to restore the home just as it originally was — even to hand-split shingles. 
From the Hoch home we went to the beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. George 
Musselman of San Antonio. It is on a high hill just across from the town of 
Hochheim. 
Mrs. Musselman is a great-grand­ daughter of V alentine Hoch. Her mother was Emma Hoch. 
The Musselmans showed us through the historic home. Part of it was built by Valentine Hoch in 1856. He built it for his daughter, Martha, when she married James II. Schwab. 
The Schwabs also were a pioneer 
German family in Texas. They operat­ ed stagecoach lines. Schwab met 
M artha Hoch while driving the In- dianola-Hochheim-Round Rock line. 

The Jaeger family is part of the 
Hochheim story. Jaeger is the third generation of his family here. 
Jaeger still has the elaborate m a­ chinist tool chest of his grandfather, 
William Jaeger. 
“ I don’t know how old it is,” Jaeger said. “ But I had an aunt who died se­ veral years ago in her 8os. She said my grandfather used to carry his tool chest in his buggy and she rode on it when she was 5 years old.” 
The garage and store operated by the 
Jaegers was built in 1926. It has had three locations, having been moved in 
1933 and again in 1956. When the high­ way shifted, the Jaegers just shifted their garage. 
But Ja e g e r’s father had an even earlier garage and gasoline station in 
Hocheim, one of the earliest in this area. 
The Hochheim area used to grow a lot of cotton and Jaeger’s father had two gins. Today there is not a cotton^ gin in the county. 

But a memento of those days is in the 
Jaeger store. The round, steel top of a cotton boiler was made into a heating stove. It has been used every winter since 1923. 
Late in the afternoon we drove out the Yoakum road to nearby Hochheim 
Prairie. 
Hochheim Prairie is a community — 
St. Anne’s Catholic Church, a store. 
Turner Hall and Hermann Sons Lodge 
No. 9o — that grew up around the home of Jacob Poth. 
Out across the prairie is the big, two-story Poth home. Though now empty, seen at a distance it still has the grandeur of its long ago days. 
At the church we talked with Mrs. 
Annaline Buntyn Crawford, a Poth’ descendant. 
“ The Poth family came to Texas from Alsace-Lorraine,” she said. “Ja ­ cob Poth came to Hochheim Prairie about 189o and in time owned land all the way to Yoakum. He gave the land for the church. 

“Jacob Poth had ll sons and three daughters. The home went to the youngest son, Louis, who died in 1975.” 
Earlier we picnicked in Hochheim s pretty little park. Land for it was given by the Braden family. Across from the park is another once fine, two-story home in which Mrs. Philip Braden and her family now live. 
History is everywhere in Hochheim. 
But don’t count out the Now Genera­ tion. 
As we stepped out of the old post office that morning, whipping down the street were two girls on a small motorcycle. 
Councilman is 
Hoch descendant 

John Steen, newly elected San Antonio city coun­ cilman and long active in San Antonio civic affairs, is a descendant of Valentine Hoch. 
Steen’s grandfather — also John Steen — married 
Otelia Hoch. 
The Hoch descendants are numerous and have had a large impact on Texas. The Cuero Record once reported in 1956 there were several hundred Hoch descendants attending the 1ooth anniversary obser­ vance of the founding of the Hoch home at Hoch­ heim. 
Hoch remarried after the death of his first wife. In addition to the children born in Germany, there were four children by this second marriage. Most of the children had large families. 
There are also many Steen descendants. The 
Steens lived across the Guadalupe River from 
Hochheim and the area was long known as “ Steen- ville.” 
John Steen owns the home in which his parents and grandparents lived. Seen from the distant highway, it is a beautiful white house atop a high hill.

 join the curb liners at the Battle of Flowers Parade. 

In celebration of National Secre­ taries Week, the Anacacho chapter of the National Secretaries Association, entertains these children and others during Fiesta Week. 

On Saturday, they will take a pinata and party refreshments to the Holm- green Children's Shelter. 

At the hospital, many beds were empty as doctors try not to schedule hospital stays during Fiesta Week. But those few left were excited over the attention. 

Balloons were blown up with funny faces for the little ones. A stack of children’s hooks were brought. Hospi­ tal trays held treats for after lunch. 

A huge spring bouquet donated by 
Kelly-Scherrer Flowers and Gifts brought Fiesta grins to small faces. 

Pink gladioli, lavender larkspur, blue irises, yellow chrysanthemums and small orchids added more color to the gaily decorated Pediatric Lounge. 

Cap pistols for the boys and a tea set for the girls were tucked among the flowers catching the children’s eye. 
Secretaries on hand for the fun were 
Chris Sommers. Susan Barale. Betty 
Cook, G erry Hutcheson and Hilda 
Scott. 

But the highlight of the day was the entrance of the King and his entour­ age. He gave the youngsters souvenir medals and pinned a royal medal on 
Chris for helping make the children's 
Fiesta happier. 

His royal convertible waited at the door to whisk him hack to the Parade.

ANew Twist to the Story of Oliver. 

 nee upon a time, as most stories of this sort begin, there was a lad named Oliver, quite an ordinary lad most would say, except for a certain tenacity of spirit few could equal. Orphaned at birth, Oliver grew from rough-hewn and humble beginnings to a young* adulthood of comfortable means through resource­ fulness, an affable nature and seemingly tireless energy. “ It’s just honest, hard work; the stuff this land is made of,” Oliver would say, shrugging oft intimations of genius. 
Cynics would curl their lips, hurl unkind epithets and other unpleas­ antries. Indeed, the powerful Fagin Conglomerate Unlimited once tried to buy out our young hero. Naturally it did not succeed. For 
Oliver was bent on providing a pleasant atmosphere for shopping and dining and meandering for his friends and neighbors. “ Unrealistic,” cried Oliver’s detractors. “ How square,” yawned the maga-malls. 
“ How nice,” said the public. 
And so it came about. Oliver’s friends, Abernathy, provided the Res­ taurant. Anytime was Ladies’ Tee-time. Oliver said, “ There should be 
‘Something Special,’ ” and there was. In fact, David Collum ’s Inc. was hardly dry before the M ark Buck stopped there. All of the activity left 
Hair-In-Motion for Amaranth of sundries. Oliver had a friend known as the Artful Dodger, who was neither a baseball player nor an auto dealer, but who was designing enough to bring in the Duran Galleries. 
“ Say Cheese Please” , or “ Chia,” if you please; both are quite correct with Oliver. O f course, The Swedish Shop, and that is of some import. 
But is there a Finale to all this, you ask? Ah, yes, and you may find the record of it all at The Record Hole. 
N ow , dear reader, we leave the question with you: Is Oliver 
“ Square” . . ? The ribbon will officially be cut on Saturday, and a host of dignitaries will be on hand for the celebration. We invite you to join us. 

OLIVER SQUARE

Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Reset danced away io, Tim Word, Queen Lucille Oppen- the evening. The Armando Castaneda heimer and Princess Cynthia Cadwallader 
Mariachi provided the beat. King Anton- all received gifts from the German Club. 

Brother worries sis 

Dear Ann: I am writ­ ing about a problem that has concerned me for a long time. It started in grade school and contin­ ued into my high school years. 
My brother (four years older) used to pester me sexually. He’d ask me to pose in the nude and un­ d re ss in front of him. 
Once he even tried, to rape me. 
I told my mother about it. 
She said, “ Tell your father.” I did. He looked at me as if I was crazy. 
So I kept away from my brother as best I could. It wasn’t easy. 
He was remarried re­ cently to a woman who has a five-year-old daughter. My heart aches when I think of my brother alone with this little girl. 
Maybe not now, maybe when she “ matures,” he will put her through the sam e hell he put me through. 
This is his second m arriage and I don’t want to make trouble. My brother and his wife 
Wedding vows are repeated 

Little Church of La 
Villita was the setting 
Sunday evening for the m arriage of Miss Mary 
Leu Briseno to Jam es L. 
Davis. The Rev. David 
VV. Edmunds officiated at the ceremony. 
The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. 
J e s u s 
Briseno. 
The groom is the son of Mrs. 
Jo sie o. Davis of Bloo­ mington, Ind. 
Serving as best man and matron of honor were Mr. and Mrs. Ro­ bert Wrigglesworth. 
After a reception at the 
East Kelly NCO Club, the couple left for a wedding trip to the valley. 
Ex-resident visiting here 

Former San Antonian 
M. Sgt Clarence L. Dean 
Jr. is in the Alamo City playing with the United 
States Army Band Herald 
Trumpets, Washington, 
DX’., during Fiesta acti­ vities. 
He is the son of the late 
Mr. and Mrs. Clarence L. 
Dean and is a graduate of 
Wheatley High School where he was drum ma­ jor. 
Sgt. Dean, his wife 
Judy and two of their sons are visiting relatives and friends in San An­ tonio before returning to their home in Alexandria, 
Va. 

Landers, 

 seem to get along very well together. 
They live 2oo m iles away so I have no way of watching for the signs I know too well. Ann, should I MYOB or what? 
It took me many years and the help of a won­ derful husband to get over my fears and anx­ ieties. I’d hate to see my niece go through what I did. What should I do? - 
Concerned In Arizona 
Dear 
Concerned: 
There is no way you can discuss this with your brother’s wife or with the child and not stir up a hornet’s nest. 
If there’s a chance that you can spend enough time with the youngster to win her confidence 
(perhaps take her for a 

 few weekends) you might stress the importance of the body as “ private property” and instruct her to tell her mother at once if ANYONE, even relatives, tries to get too 
“ friendly.” This is as far as you can go, dear. 
Civilized 

D ear Ann Lan ders: 

Why doesn’t the United 
States learn something from the more civilized countries? 
Every year the number of children who die in traffic accidents rises in the United States, but not in Norway and Sweden. 
In Norway, for exam­ ple, traffic fatalities among pre-school chil­ dren have been reduced by 3o per cent. The rea­ son: Traffic clubs. 
Children are enrolled on their third birthdays. 
They receive four years of “ training.” The traffic clubs teach children to look both ways before crossing the street, never to cross against a red light, and never to take foolish chances. 
The club also warns parents not to violate traffic rules in order that they might serve as good exam p les for their children. 
Professor Per Schiold- borg of Oslo studied the traffic behavior of chil­ dren and discovered that 

 the club-trained young­ sters were nearly 5o per cent more cautious than non-club members when not accom panied by adults. 
Any suggestions, Ann? 

• I Love Kids 
Dear Love: Yes. Let’s hope the National Safety 
Council (which does a very good job in the U.S.) sees your letter and takes some action.

THE BIBLE 

No. 288, A Prophecy of Desolation and Hope 

Zephamah. the son of Cushi and descendant of Hezekiah, pro­ phesied during the reign of Josiah (son of Anion), king of Judah His prophecy was unusual in that he portrayed absolute destruction to be followed by the rejuvenation and salvation of the remnant of Israel 
"I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the Lord I will consume man and beast, I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea. and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord ’’ (Zephamah 
1 2-3) 
However, the prophet's tone changed rather abruptly "The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall teed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid Sing. O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel, be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of 
Jerusalem ” (Zephaniah 3:13-14)

Energy doomsday foreseen 

The President of the United States has somberly called on the American people to sacrificial changes in our lifestyle before an energy doomsday arrives. 
The kind of sacrifices 

San Antonio EXPRESS N E W S — Saturday April 23 1977 

 for which he calls have been made by our nation during World War II. The difference is Pearl Har­ bor. 
Then we had a drama­ tic and immediately un­ d ersta n d a b le th re at to our existence as a free people. The nation was galvanized to action. We knew we were in a life and death struggle. 
D espite the cold weather and chronic fuel shortages, we did not feel similarly threatened as a nation this winter. It was serious but not a Pearl 
Harbor disaster. 
People have a difficult time responding to chal­ lenge for .sacrifice unless convinced that it is ne­ cessary, will help the si­ tuation, and is shared equitably with others. 
Deeper 
There is a deeper di­ mension of the energy crisis than its pragmatic political level. 
At the het of the Bibli­ cal revelation is the fae‘ that God created a world rich in reso u rces and tu rned to m ankind a sacred responsibility for superintending it. 
The picture in Eden is that Adam was given re­ sponsibility to “ nam e” the c re a tu re s — thus giving meaning to their existence 
— and to 
“ tend” the garden. 
We are in charge under 
God's mandate. There is a spiritual dimension to th at tru st. We cannot continue to waste without rea p in g its co nse­ quences. 
Dust bowl 
During the 193o's, soil was eroding. Dust storms c re a te d a dust howl where some of our most productive farmland had been. 
We saw it as disaster. 
Churches began examin­ ing their responsibility. 
Soil conservation Sun­ days m arked the calen­ dars of many congrega­ tions. It was obviously a religious responsibility to tend G od’s creation more effectively. 
Face problem 
The time has come for us to soberly face the complex problem of en­ ergy. 
Marital status off for bond buyers 

W ASHINGTON POST SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - Wo­ men who buy United 
States Savings Bonds will no longer have to indicate whether they are “ Miss” or “ Mrs.” on the bond according to a new regu­ lation issued at the ex­ press direction of Trea­ sury Secretary VV. Mi­ chael Blumenthal. 
The new policy thus gives women the option men have always had of keep­ ing private their marital status on bonds if they so desire. 

Blumenthal, in one of his first administrative actions since taking of­ fice, has also met one of the most persistent claims of women’s rights groups: there generally is not reason fin- the go­ vernment and others to know a woman’s marital status. 

Effective date 
The change, effective 
March 31, was announced about three weeks after 
Blum enthal received a le tte r from Karen De- 
Crow, p resid en t of tte 
National Organization for 
Women (NOW), request­ ing an explanation of the previous practice. 
The Treasury Depart­ ment has justified the m andatory use of cour­ tesy titles on the groun they facilitate the identi­ fication of savings bonds claimed to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. 

Identity difficult 
William M. Gregg, de­ puty commissioner of the public debt, explained it is sometimes difficult to identify the beneficiary of a bond if two or more people with the sam e name lay claim to it.

We are re q u ire d in stewardship to be found faithful. Many proposals will be debated in the next few months. 
There is one alte rn a ­ tive closed to us. It is to ignore the challenge of energy p ro blem s and profiteer out of our stu­ died indifference to it. 
The war is declared but tru m p ets sounding u n­ certain sounds mean that few prepare for battle.

Brainwashed priest sues his 
{Parent 

W ASHINGTON STAR SERVICE 
WASHINGTON — A priest of the Old Catholic 
Church, subjected to religious deprogram m ing because his Episcopalian parents objected to his religious orientation, has filed a $3.3-million suit against his parents and an Arizona organization that specializes in deprogramming. 
The suit, brought in Oklahoma City this week by 
22-year-old Rev. Philaret Taylor (Walter Robert 
Taylor), is believed to be the first major suit brought by an offspring against his parents since deprogramming activities began five years ago in this country. 
The Old Catholic Church is a large religious organization that broke off from the Roman Catholic 
Church in the early 17oos, in part over innovative practices brought into the Roman Catholic Church and because the Old Catholic* Church believes the 
Pope's authority does not extend beyond his own diocese, the Archdiocese of Rome. 
In the United States there are nearly 5oo,ooo Old 
Catholic members; around the world the numbers run to several million. 
Attention getters 
Most of the deprogrammers’ attention has been focused on such religious groups as the Unification 
Church of the Holy Spirit headed by the Rev. Sun 
Myung Moon, the Hare Krishna Hindu sect. Love 
Israel, the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foun­ dation and the Children of God. 
Taylor’s suit charges deprivation of civil rights, legal and medical malpractice, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and as-, sault and battery. 
Taylor, in a sworn affidavit, says he was forcefully taken from the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary oil July 15 on a court order placing him under temporary guardianship of his father, Dr. Walter 
Taylor. The priest had no recourse against the action and was denied an attorney of his choice, he said. 
On July 22 the Oklahoma court that granted the conservatorship order revoked it after discovering 
Oklahoma law does not have provision for. such orders. 
The court ordered the priest’s father and defen­ dants Michael Trauscht and Wayne N. Howard to cease the use of mind-altering techniques against the young man. 
Howard and T rauscht are connected with the 
Freedom in Thought Foundation in Tucson — a major focus of current deprogramming activities. 
Moved to Ohio 
But by that time, Taylor had been moved to the 
Akron. Ohio, area and subjected to deprogramming. 
“ I was kept in a motel by a goon squad for eight days,” he said. His father and his brother David assisted the deprogrammers at the Ohio site, Taylor said. 
Taylor, in the legal brief, said he was subjected to 
“ unyielding physical and mental abuse, harass­ ment, ridicule and threats’’ directed toward getting him to “ alter (my) religious beliefs, practice, asso­ ciations and . . . lifestyle.” 
The priest said he then was flown to Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix, where he continued to be held captive and was subjected to further deprogram ­ ming. He said Howard and his conspirators “ em ­ ployed threats and intimidation to coerce” him into signing documents adverse to his interests. 
Howard and the priest’s mother, Sylvia, sought to initiate tem porary guardianship proceedings in 
Arizona. 
The priest said the Arizona petition was “ willfully and maliciously filed” and was "based on false allegations that no guardianship proceedings were pending.’’ even though both were aware of the Ok­ lahoma proceedings. 
The priest’s father is a medical doctor, whom the priest said had gotten an “ illegally obtained’’ order to treat him. The priest said his father gave “ false testimony” to obtain the order.

NEW YORK (AP) - 
The stock market sus­ tained a broad setback 
Friday, with Internation­ al 
Business 
Machines leading the retreat for the second day in a row. 

Analysts said the mar­ ket was weighed down by uncertainty over the ul­ timate shape and impact of government energy policy and concern that interest rates might soon be headed higher. 
The Dow Jones average of 3o industrials dropped 

8.73 to 927.o7. The Dow s decline for the week came to 2o.69 points, erasing most of the previous week’s 28.88-point gain. 
Losers outnumbered gainers by dose to a 3-1 spread on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
Volume on the N YSE eased to 2o.7o million shares from 22.74 million 
Thursday. 
Edmund C. Puekhaber, director of research at 
Dean Witter & Co., said some investors might see 
President Carter’s en­ 

 ergy proposals “ as defin­ ing a limit on economic growth, as contributing to inflation, and as increas­ ing governmental intru­ sion into the market­ place." 
He added. “ All three concerns may be valid, but in fact, the program might be absolutely necessary to effect a more orderly transition from

 the era of energy plenty to one of austerity." 
Analysts also pointed to fears that a recent bulge in the money supply might prompt the Feder­ al Reserve to begin tight­ ening credit before long. 
Ease policy 
However, after the close, the Fed reported that its open market com­ mittee had voted in March to ease monetary policy slightly. 
IBM shares stood at 258 at the 4 p.m. NYSE close, showing a 6-point loss for the second consecutive dav.. 

The issue, owned by more investing institu­ tions than any other stock, has been under pressure since the company reported a smaller-than- expected rise in earnings for the first quarter ear­ lier this month. 
Standard & Poor’s in­ dex of 4oo industrials fell 
1.55 to 1o9.o5, and S& P’s 
5oo-stock composite index was down 1 .3 1 at 98.44. 
Eastman Kodak was actively traded, down 1% at 64%. Like IBM , it touched a new low for the year for the second ses­ sion in a row. 
On Thursday the com­ 

 pany .said it would reduce its instant film work force by 1 5 o people. 

S.S. Kresre, the volume leader among Big Board stocks, fell 7/g to 29% in trading marked by a 
33o,ooo-share block at 29. 
A few days ago the com­ pany estimated flat earn­ ings for the fiscal quarter that ends next week. 
Zenith Radio fell 2?s to 
2o% on lower first quarter profits. 
The NYSE’s composite index lost .6 5 to 5 3 .6 9 . 
In other markets, the 
American 
Stock Ex­ change market value in­ dex gave up . 8 7 to 1 1 1 . 7 5 . and the NASDAQ compo­ site index of over-the- counter stocks declined 
.7o to 95.12. 

The President of trou­ bled Com mon weal th Oil 
Refining To.. Inc., has fold stockholders in a letter that a seizure of acecounts by Puerto Rico banks and other factors could force the company to seek protection of the courts in a reorganiza­ tion proceeding. 
Gary Davis told the stockholders that the ac­ tions by the banks fol­ lowed legal actions by 
Gulf Oil Corp., a major trade creditor, to attach various assets of Com­ monwealth. including major bank assets. 
In a related move Fri­ day, 
Davis announced the government and its utility, 
Puerto 
Rico 
Water Resources Author­ ity, has promised $2o million in aid to help the company. 
The Puerto Rico Gov­ ernment 
Development 
Bank is opening a re­ volving line of credit in the amount of $15 million, 
Davis said. 
Pay claims 
Also, the government- owned utility will pay the company about $5 million in settlement of certain claims between the utili­ ty and the company, Da­ vis said. 
Davis also said the San 
Antonio-based company will be receiving an ad­ ditional amount for cer­ tain fuel oil which is purchased by the utility. . 
The company said the action was taken by the government to protect amounts of supplemental fees allegedly due the government. That move was made, the letter 

 said, under Puerto Rican 
Executive Law, which does not grnat the com­ pany possible relief in the courts. 

"The result, of these ac­ tions has been to put ex­ treme strains on the com­ pany’s cash and working capital positions and has seriously called into question the company's continued ability to oper­ ate without recourse to judicial protection," the letter said. “ In the face of such events your man­ agement has continually endeavored to solve these problems.

Soybean prices hit new highs 

Soybean prices regis­ tered new seasonal highs this week in response to the USD A report which indicated that, as of April 
I. domestic supplies amounted to 615 million bushels. 
This confirmed a su­ spected tightness in supplies brought about by good domestic usage and export sales. 
The National Soybean 
Processors Assn. report­ ed (-rushings of beans to make oil and meal to­ talled 464 million bushels so far this year and the 
US DA reported export projections have been reached with slightly over 4 months remaining in the market season. 
Brazil, another impor­ tant producer, an­ nounced a temporary su-

 sponsion of soybean oil exports while 
Peru announced its anchovy catches were low but the 
Peruvian fleet was still fishing. 
Ground anchovies pro­ duce fishmeal, an impor­ tant competitior of soy­ bean meal in high protein feed suppliments. 
The strong perfor­ mance in beans aided wheat and corn which have been tinder pres­ sure from less than posi­ tive supply-demand si­ tuations. 
It also helped to firm silver prices as the pre­ cious metal reacted to increased inflation fears caused by the variety in which soybean products are used.

S.A. oil firm may be forced to reorganize 

MONDAY — Traders were in a cautious mood awaiting President 
Carter’s energy address. After ad­ vancing 33.o3 points in the last six days of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average reversed direction and wound up with a loss of an even 5.oo points on the day. Big Three Motors (Chrysler, 
Ford and GM) were actively traded and all posted losses. 

TUESDAY — The market continued to react to the nation’s energy problems. The blue chips in the DJIA closed with a loss of 3.99. The tran­ sportation average (not shown on ac- eompaning chart) posted a big gain of 
2.53, led by coal-carrying railroads. 
The market ignored two bullish items; a 1.7 per cent increase in personal in­ come and a strong gain in housing starts. Auto stocks continued to run scared. Big Three motors again made the most active list, with Chrysler off 
%, Ford off 1% and GM off 1%. 

WEDNESDAY — The much awaited 
Carter speech scheduled for nation­ wide telecast tonight did not slow up trading. Volume was heavy at 25.1 million shares with better than 2 to I on the upside. The Dow industrials closed up 3.82. The transportation average scored another health gain of 
2.73. Auto shares staged fractional gains. Gross National Product (ad­ justed for inflation) reported an ad­ vance in the first quarter at a 5.2 per cent annual rate. 

THURSDAY — An early morning rally failed. The DJIA posted a sharp 

 rise of 3.9o in the first 3o minutes, turned red before midday and closed with a net loss of 6.79. A late news item, a government report of o.9 per cent decline in retail sales, influenced late selling. Analysts said President 
Carter’s address on his energy pro­ gram was well received by the public, but reaction from congressmen and industry leaders varied. 

FRIDAY — Sagging prices in early trading carried over from the previous day’s selloff. The latest report of an increase in money supply provided a renewed concern over inflation. In the whole market, the losers outnumbered gainers three to one, and the ratio of downside volume over upside volume was six to one. The Dow closed at 
927.o7 for a loss of 8.73. 

SUMMARY — President Carter’s proposed energy program set the mood for the week’s market action. First it was suspense, then the preview broad­ cast and then the detailed proposal telecast to Congress. Analysts felt some of the proposals were not favor­ ably received by some lawmakers and investors who expressed “ confusion, uncertainty, too many taxes, etc.” The week's loss on the Dow was 2o.69. 

RANGE — High was made on Mon­ day at 951.32. Low was made on Friday at 923.59. Close, Friday, 927.o7. Loss on the week, 2o.69. Volume, all shares traded on the N YSE, 1o5.87 million shares.

Solarcraft system debuts in Thousand Oaks 

 m w ww in. 1 o ut 
.arc! to years oil ne when energy 

Olmos Home Builders pre­ views the dawn of a new era with the new Solarcraft, energy - conserving solar water heating system. 
Every sunshine hour. Summer or 
Winter, this new innovative system will save on fuel costs. The hot water supply is never interrupted, even dur­ ing extended cloudy periods, because a built-in electric booster element auto­ matically takes over the water heating system until the sun shines again. 
16711 Ledge Falls 
Olmos Home Builders’ magnificent new home at 16711 Ledge Falls in 
Thousand Oaks is a rare combination of style and beauty, and now, with the new , all - climate solar system for tapping the free and unlimited energy of the sun, the proud new owners of this home can look forward saving fuel costs at a time prices are soaring. 
This beautiful new home has delicate tones of off - white, beige and tan brick combined with cedar trim and a shake cedar roof. 
A stained glass w indow of yellow iris in the entrance foyer is a prelude lo the beauty of the interior, and an enclosed courtyard, also visible from the foyer, is just waiting for the artistic green thumb of its new owners* 
Step down into a magnificent room, the heart of the house — a room with a two - way fireplace with dining room on one side and the family living room on the other. You are overwhelmed by space; the soaring height of the free - standing brick fireplace extends up to the beamed cathedral ceiling and beyond the glass walls. Beyond the terrace lies a private forest of oak trees. 
You know, then, that you live in a very special place. Thousand Oaks. 
The serenity — the rustic elegance — is all there in your backyard. 
The same serenity and elegance are carried into the large master bedroom suite on tile first floor of this home. A large bedroom and adjoining bath have tremendous walk - in “ his - n - her” closets, a Roman tub and shower and the rich wood cabinetry repeated throughout the rest of the house. Under foot, you walk on a “ cloud” of thick, deep - pile carpet in a honey pecan color. 
I bis beautiful warm color flows 

THOUSAND OAKS premieres solar-assisted home built by Olmos Home Builders firm showing it at 1671 I Ledge Falls 

 throughout the house, up the stairs and onto the home’s second level, where three more large bedrooms are situat­ ed. A large second bath and ample storage closets make this home ideal for the growing family. 

To help satisfy the needs of that growing family are the charming breakfast nook and large kitchen overlooking the "back terrace. W all co­ vering in warm tones of yellow- and orange; rich, dark - stained cabinets; 
Magic Chef appliances; and an interior 

 garden window for growing herbs all come together to inspire the happy host and hostess iii food preparation and entertaining. 

A step beyond the kitchen is a large utility room and powder room iii the same warm tones of the kitchen area. 

The connecting two - car garage has additional storage space to handle the many extras every family acquires. 
The price of this energy - saving home is $74,95o; its square footage totals 
2,319. 

The joy of living in this beautiful new home is enhanced because of the loca­ tion. Thousand Oaks is a community where the difference can even be felt. 
Gently rolling hills, overlooking the 
San Antonio skyline, are covered with nature’s’own magnificent oak trees. 

Nestled among them is the most complete tennis installation in San 
Antonio, Thousand Oaks Racquet Club, which includes lighted outdoor and air conditioned indoor courts, a complete health club, Olympic-size swimming 

 pool and clubhouse for entertaining. 
Thousand Oaks residents have special membership privileges and categories to suit their needs and budgets. 

Living in the country, so close to the city, you will find Thousand Oaks con­ venient to shopping areas and all ma­ jor points of destination.

39o3 Barrington, one of, the more imaginatively, planned apartment com-, munities in northeastern- 
San Antonio, at the samef time seems out of place in Maymont, but in an­ other sense. 
This is because of the extremely reasonable rates at the comprehen­ sive project. In fact, not until 39o3 Barrington be­ gan leasing were such rates known to the espe­ cially presitgious area of 
Marymont. 
Numerous facilities are available to residents at 39o3 Barrington, just as if they all were in their very own back yards. 
Even that particular phrase in no way exaggerates on the certainty of privacy resi­ dents at 39o3 Barrington enjoy daily. 
39o3 Barrington’s of­ ferings include an indoor handball court, three tennis courts and other recreational facilities. 
The family section has a swimming pool, basket­ ball court, tennis court and fenced playground.

This New Home 
Costs Less Than 
Your Old H ome. 

I'm Buddy Burns. And I’d like to shed some light on your old home. If your home is 
5 years old or older, chances are it’s obsolete. 
That's right, obsolete. Be­ cause at the time your home was built, there were virtually no cnergy-cffi- ciency standards As a result, many San Antonians are faced with utility bills that may soon exceed their house payments! 

Whv NOW Is The Time To Buy. 
Let s look at the facts. Since you invested in your home a few years ago, two things have hap­ pened. For one, you've been making house payments for sev­ eral years, so your ci/intv has grown. Too, since the cost of building a new home has stead­ ily increased, the cost of replac­ ing your home has increased 
BUT, because your old home isn t energy efficient, it wastes valuable energy. And believe it or not, homeowners around the country are actually beginning to lose money when they sell their older homes. Because no­ 

 body wants to buy a home where the cost of heating and cooling exceeds the monthly payments. 
M y advice is this: With the money you can make by selling your old home right now, you can probably make the down­ payment and move into a new 
Burn\ Co. Power Saver* home today. And, while your house payments may be a little higher, the lower utility bills should easily offset the difference. The only thing you can't afford to do is wait much longer. 

 mg and cabinetry, and wood- burning fireplaces. Big, bright 
"wife saver" kitchens, with 
General Electric appliances and plenty of cabinet storage. Luxu­ rious baths with marble vanities and full size tubs And elegant master suites, with walk-in closets and separate dressing areas Priced from $46,ooo to 
$65,ooo For additional informa­ tion, call the area sales office

Great bedroom, 
Agnes and Harry Owens! 

 on't be surprised if someone tells you how great your Great America home looks. Because at 
Great America, we believe you can see the difference quality makes. 
In our garden kitchens, with handfimshed cabinets and top quality appliances. In our roomy living areas, with vaulted cathedral ceilings, built-in bookcases and woodburn- ing fireplaces. In our lavish ceramic tile baths, with marble vanities and decorator appointments. 
Even in our generous mas­ ter suites, with private baths and walk-in closets. 
Everywhere you look, there is careful attention to design, styling, practi­ cality and energy-cffi- ciency.

California styling. Some have soaring rooflines, 

 cedar trim and second- story balconies. Others are simple, yet elegant. 
But all are equally suited to entertaining and day- to-day family living. 
You'll find these really great homes in San 
Antonio's finest com munities. In Northwest 
San Antonio, we have new homes in Park Forest,

Construction in Camelot ‘hot and heavy’ 

Construction of new home.s in Camelot is hot and heavy these days to meet the growing de­ mand for Ray Ellison homes in the popular northeastern San Antonio residential area outside the reach of city taxes 

 but close to the center of action. 
Many of those looking at Camelot homes are apartment dwellers who believe rising rents and individual metering for utility costs provide good reason to look into the

 investment advantages of a new home. 
The economic advan­ tages of adopting a Ca­ melot lifestyle aren't li­ mited to equity build-up. 
Families are finding that a home equipped with energy-saving features can provide lower utility bills than living in an apartment with no en­ ergy-sa vers. 
Ray Ellison homes constructed since Ja n ­ uary, 1976 feature com­ plete energy-saving packages designed to save to V& or more on utility costs. The Ellison energy package consists of extra wall and ceiling insulation which exceeds 
VA/FHA standards; dou- ble-paned windows; spe­ cial caulking around windows and doors; power attic ventilators; and energy-efficient air conditioning and heating systems. 
While Camelot econ­ omies are many and var­ ied, the fundamental 

 economy of reasonable monthly payments is still a reality for Ray Ellison homeowners. In Camelot, homes are still available in the $2os and $3os, based on 8 per cent VA 

 financing. Of course, other designs are availa­ ble in a full range of choices, including the 
$4os and even the $f)os in 
Camelot’s prestigious 
Brookwood. 

Whatever the peaceful serenity of the Camelot lifestyle, living is anyth­ ing but dull in this excit­ ing neighborhood which serves as a showcase for dynamic Windsor Park

The Greater San An­ tonio Builders Associa­ tion’s general member­ ship meeting Tuesday evening in its auditorium will feature 
Frank 
Abagnale Jr., the incre­ dible. most preposterous hoaxer who ever hood­ winked the world. 

He became six differ­ ent men, always one jump ahead of exposure, by successfully assuming the identities of an air­ line pilot, medical doc­ 

 tor, lawyer, stock broker and college professor. At the same time, he suc­ ceeded in cashing over 
$2.5 million in bad checks in more than 26 counties. 
Performers 
The program also will honor the association’s top performers in the re­ cent Houston vs. San An­ tonio Inter - City Mem­ bership Challenge. 
Membership Chairman 
Gary Sheffield will pre­ sent special awards to 

 top producer Harris Con­ nell of Prestige Homes; top team captain Darolyn 
Akers of Tiffany Stone & 
Brick; and second top producer Bill Worth of 
McDonough Bros. The local builders association outproduced the Houston association, 12o to 36. 
Reservations can be made for the dinner meeting by calling the association’s head­ quarters at 696 - 38oo. 
Cost is $6 per person. 

Mall and many large su­ permarkets, drug stores and specialty shops es­ tablished in the area. 
The three ‘ B 's ” are taught to Camelot young­ sters in excellent North 
East District schools which emphasize educa­ tional excellence and varied extracurricular activities that instill lea­ dership and initiative. 
M ilitary commuters find Camelot located squarely between Fort 
Sam Houston and Ran­ dolph AFB. The conven­ ient location also means leisure moments can be spent rolling on the 
Paseo del Rio or at the 
Institute of Texan Cul­ tures after a short drive downtown via the ex­ pressway. 

Model homes may be seen in Camelot from 9 a.m. weekdays; from IO a.m. 
Saturdays; and from ll a.m. Sundays until after dark daily, at

Ooing much more than helping you buy and sell real estate ... your 
Realtor is your voice in many forums ... speaking out in behalf of p ro­ perty owners, always with your best interests in mind. O n matters of land usage planning, taxation, industrial expansion, maintaining p ro ­ perty values, urban improvements and government relations, your 
Realtor is your spokesman. Always as close as your telephone, he is waiting to discuss real estate matters with you at any time.

Toughest drug laws expected 

SAN DIEGO (AP) - 
TheDrugandEnforcement 
Administration is putting together the toughest an­ ti-narcotics laws in U. S. history to be sent to Con­ gress this summer, its director said Friday. 
They are aimed at an estimated $1o billion in u ntaxed narcotics reven­ ue as well as jailing criminals, Richard Ben- singer said. 
“ Narcotics trafficking is the biggest untaxed bu­ siness in the world.” he said in an interview at a conference on border crime. 
“ We need legislation 

 that would have the max­ imum financial impact. 
We had one case last year in which the man convict­ ed had a $33o,ooo house, a 
Rolls Royce, a Jaguar, 
$125,ooo in cash in the house and huge bank ac­ count.” 
Seizure 

Bensinger said the laws in preperation by the 
Carter administration would allow for seizure of bank accounts and other property acquired through illegal narcotics deals. 
In addition, he said he said they would set min-

 imum fixed sentences of possibly IO years in prison for major heroin traf­ fickers and deny bail to all suspects arrested in nar­ cotics crimes who are il­ legal aliens, or use false passports or have past convictions of narcotics crimes. 
Bensinger said the DEA hopes that the revised sentencing and bail laws will be before.Congress by 
July. 
But the seizure of mon­ ey and property acquired through narcotics dealings is more com­ plicated and may not be ready during 1977, he said. 
In 1975, he said, nearly 
4,ooo people were convict­ ed of heroin and cocaine trafficking but one in three got sentences under three years’ duration. 
A fixed sentence of IO years for convicted heroin dealers is under study, 
Bensinger said. 
The current law allows the Internal Revenue Ser­ vice to seize and tax earn­ ings on narcotics profits u rrler jeopardy assess­ ments.

House group may question 
FBI director 

WASHINGTON (A P) 
— A House subcommittee may summon FBI direc­ tor Clarence M. Kelley to defend his public sug­ gestion that Atty. Gen. 
Griffin Bell should drop the prosecution of an FBI man charged with illegal mail opening and wire­ tapping. 
Rep. Theodore Weiss, 
D-N.Y., said Friday he is urging his colleagues on the 
Government 
Information subcommit­ tee to call Kelley to a hearing to answer ques­ tions about his sudden intervention in the case. 
Weiss told a reporter he will bring up the mat­ ter at a subcommittee meeting Wednesday. He said chairman Richard­ son 
Preyer, 
D-N.C., 
“ shares my concern about adherence to the 
Constitution” but has suggested that a hearg should be delayed until 
Kelley responds to a cri­ tical letter from Weiss. 
Meantime, Kelley and 
Bell were preparing for a summit meeting Monday to discuss whether the 
Justice epartment should proceed with the prosecution of John J. 
Kearney and other FB I men expected to be in­ dicted for their invol- 
Attorney quits post 

John Hannigan, city attorney for Hollywood 
Park for the past two years, has resigned ef­ fective June I. 
Hannigan, who is mov­ ing to Dallas, is un Air 
Force retiree. 
He settled in Hollywood 
Park in 1971 to practice law following his retire­ ment. 

 vement in allegedly il­ legal burglaries, mail openings and wiretapping in the early 
197o’s. 
Kearney, a retired supervisor in the New 
York FBI office, was in­ dicted April 7 for direct­ ing a squad of agents to use allegedly illegal tac­ tics to spy on New York 
City residents thought to be in contact with 
Weather Underground fugitives charged with terrorist acts. 
Department sources said other indictments were planned as a result of a year long investiga­ tion of FBI tactics. 
Controversy 
The indictment touched off heated con­ troversy which mounted after Kelley announced 
April 14 he would ask 
Bell to reconsider the prosecution in light of the department’s previous decision not to bring charges against Central 
Intelligence Agency of­ ficials involved in illegal mail opening. 
Weiss said Kelley’s statement amounts to “ a serious abdication of your responsibilities as a public official sworn to up’old the rule of law.” 
In a letter to Kelley last week, the congressman said Kearney “ may or may not be guilty of the felony charges lodged against him. Thai is a matter for a jury to decide.” 
But he said Kelley’s statement suggests the director is more con­ cerned with FBI morale than with getting at the truth of the charges. 
He said Kelley would have served the bureau better by stating that agents must “ abide by the same laws they seek to enforce.”

Identity uncertain of 114 crash victims 

DOVER, Del. (AP) - A team of ex­ perts at over Air Force Base was unable to identify 114 of the 326 Amer­ ican victims of the world's worst air­ line disaster, a spokesman for Pan 
American World Airways said Friday. 
The victims of the March 27 collision between two Boeing 747s were brought to the over Air Force Base on April 3 to be identified. The accident involving a Pan Am jet and a Dutch KEM jet at 
Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary 
Islands left 58o persons dead. 
Bruce Haxthausen, an airline spo­ kesman. said that although Pan Am officials had hoped all the victims could be identified, the team of experts was never confident of complete success. 
“ There was always some doubt, due to the condition of some of the remains that they had to work with.” he said. 
He said that a Pan Am 7o7 returned the unidentified bodies to California on 
Friday where most of the victims lived. 
A team of 9o pathologists, dentists. 

 blood specialists, radiologists and fin­ gerprint experts completed its work at the base mortuary Thursday evening, he said. 
“ There is a chance that additional identifications will be made. We're still hoping that some medical records will be furnished by next-of-kin,” 
Haxthausen added. 
• In that ease, the work would be done in Washington where experts could match records made before and after death, he said. 
As victims were identified, Pan Am contacted next-of-kin for instructions on what to do with the remains, 
Haxthausen said. 
He said the airline plans to hold a memorial service for all the victims sometime next week in Southern 
California. 
Pan Am made arrangements with the government to use the base mor­ tuary for the identification operation because it is one of the few facilities in the country that can handle the large number of bodies.

Regional meet hit by legal hassle 
Nuggets in need o f gold 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DENVER — The National Basketball 
Association’s Denver Nuggets are finan­ cially unstable and are looking for ways to meet unexpectedly high costs of join­ ing the league, The Denver Post said 
Friday. 

In a copyright story, the newspaper said it has learned that the Nuggets are interested in m ak­ ing changes in their lease agreem ent for the use of Denver’s McNichols Sports Arena to increase the amount they earn from their appearances there. 
The team, now in the middle of a series of NBA playoff gam es against Portland, is having the problems despite the fact attendance at Nuggets’ gam es hit an all-time high this year. 
B ig loss 
Denver City Councilman Steve Grogan said the 
Nuggets suffered a net loss of $417,ooo for the year ending last May 31 and that losses have increased since then, the newspaper said. 
Grogan told the Post the money problems are so bad he feels the Nuggets w ill either have to be sold to an owner with more capital, renegotiate their NBA franchise and players contracts, move to another city or fold. 
Nuggets General Manager Carl Scheer said the organization is concerned about the “ financial sta b ility ” of the club “ but we are not going broke.” 
C hanges 

Scheer said the m atter hasn’t officially been discussed with city officials. “ This is not the time, in the middle of the playoffs and with the enthusiasm of the Denver fans at its highest, to discuss this very sensitive issue,” Scheer said. 
Both the Nuggets and the National Hockey 
League Colorado Rockies have indicated they want to discuss possible changes in the arrange­ ments they have with the city, said Bob Locke, the city official who negotiated the contract*with the Nuggets.

Bethea loses 

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Unbeaten 
Marvin Johnson, ham m ering repea­ tedly to the bloodied face of Tom 
Bethea, stopped the veteran boxer on a technical knockout at 2:5o of the fourth round Friday night in a nationally televised light heavyweight bout at the 
Indianapolis Convention Center. 

The left-handed Johnson, a 1972 U.S. 
Olympic medalist from Indianapolis, recorded his 15th straight professional victory and moved to the semifinals of the $1 million World Television Cham­ pions elim ination series against un­ beaten Eddie Davis. 
The 33-year-old Bethea, IO years older than Johnson, offered serious opposition only early in the first round, backing Johnson to the ropes. Johnson then landed several hard shots to the head, staggering Bethea, and was in control the rest of the way.

Erving hits 27 

BOSTON (AP) - Julius Erv­ ing, Doug Collins and George

Lloyd Free for a 1o9-1oo victory over the Celtics Friday night. 

Philadelphia now leads 2-1 in the 
National Basketball Association best- of-seven quarter-final playoff series. 
Free, who had just two points in the first half, finished with 22 points as the 
76ers won their second straight over 
Boston’s defending NBA champions. 
Erving took scoring honors with 27 p o in ts w hile C ollins had 25 and

However, it was Free, a second year guard, who nailed down the victory. He scored eight points in the final three m inutes of the third period and added

The 76ers threw up a tight defense and capitalized at the free throw line to build a quick 13-point lead, 27-14. They ended the first period with a 34-25 ad­ vantage. 
Philadelphia bult the advantage to 15 points in the second period before set­ tling for a 56-45 halftime lead. In the first half, the 76ers converted 16 of 22 free throws compared to Boston’s five for five.

El Paso wins 2 

By CLIFFORD BROYLES 
OF THE EXPRESSNEWS STAFF 

So much for opening night, even if it did come four days late. 

The El Paso Diablos spoiled San 
Antonio’s home opener twi#e, 8-1 and 
7-2, at V'.J. Keefe Field Friday night. 
The Dodgers played as if they had not been on the field in a w eek, w hich they hadn't. 
But neither had the 
Diablos. 
Both had been off since last Friday be­ cause of four p o st­ ponem ents and two open dates. 
El Paso, which ran its Texas League re ­ cord to 5-o, built two early leads and held 
BROT LES on easily behind near-flawless pitching from starters Bob Ferris and Bobby 
Leslie. 
San Antonio had only five hits in the two games. 
Ferris allowed the Dodgers.only two hits and an unearned run over six in­ nings in the first game before Carlos 
Perez pitched the seventh. 
Leslie tossed a walkless three-hitter in the nightcap. 
San Antonio was outhit, 2o-5, as 1,914 fans watched the opener that was de­ layed four days by rain and wet grounds. 
It would be hard to fault Dodger starters and losers Mitch Bobinger and 
Mike Martin. Both were working for the first time since the team left Flor­ ida two weeks ago. But both were in­ effective. 
Bobinger was the victim of a four- run third inning that included triples by Jay Peters and Pat Kelly and a solo home run by Ken Landreaux. 
Landreaux blasted a two-run homer off M artin in the first inning of the second game. But the big blow in the nightcap for El Paso was a third-in­ ning grand slam by Kelly, which gave the Diablos a 7-o lead. All the runs

Tie for the top 

A S S O C IA T E D W ES S 

NEW ORLEANS - M iller 
Barber blasted out of a bunker directly into the hole on the 17th green Friday to card a six-under* par 66 and grab a tie for the first round lead in the $175,ooo New 
Orleans Open. 

Craig Stadler fired his 66 Thursday before rain washed out play in the af­ ternoon segm ent of that qualifying round. 
Play picked up where it left off 
Thursday and when it was over, there were six golfers tied for second place, two strokes back at 68. 
Masters champion Tom Watson and 
Keith F’ergus went into Friday’s play holding that second spot between them, but Don January, George Knud- son, Chi Chi Rodriguez, and Bobby 
Cole, completing their rounds in Fri­ day’s sunshine and gentle breezes, also carded 68s. 
Barber was three under par at the end of ll holes Thursday. He had bo­ gled the 1oth and birdied the lith to stay within striking distance of the lead. He picked up play Friday with a birdie on 12, pars on 13 and 14, and another bird on the long 15th hole. 
After a par on 16, he seemed to be in deep trouble when his drive landed in the sand of a fairway bunker 85 feet from the 17th pin. But he blasted out, bouncing the ball into the cup for a birdie and a tie for the lead. 
The second round of qualifing is scheduled for Saturday, with the final 
36 holes to be played Sunday. 
Barber won the New Orleans Open in 
197o and lost a playoff to Jack Nicklaus in 1973.

PAT BRADLEY watches putt drop during Friday play

Bradley leads 

A S S O C IA T E D PRESS 
RALEIGH, N.C. — Hard driving Pat Bradley, taking advantage of ideal weather conditions, pieced together a tournament record eight-under-par 64 for the first-round lead Friday in a $5o,ooo 
Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament. 
Miss Bradley’s round, which includ­ ed seven birdies and an eagle, enabled the fourth-year pro to take a three- stroke cushion over JoAnn earner, who managed a 67 on the rolling 6,239-yard par-72 North Ridge Country Club iayout. 
Just behind Miss Bradley and Miss 
Garner in the race for the $7,5oo first- place prize were a pair of the LPGA’s biggest stars, Judy Rankin and Kathy 
Whitworth, both of whom came in with rounds of 69. 
F’orm er Open cham pion Sandra 
Spuzich headed a large group of golfers tied at two-under-par 7o, while 
Sandra Palmer and three-time Raleigh w inner Carol Mann each had rounds of 
71. Of the 91 players in the field, a total of 27 were able to match par or better.

CINCINNATI (AP) - Terry Slater was fired as coach of the World Hockey 
Association Cincinnati Stingers F ri­ day, less than a week after his favored club was eliminated from the WHA playoffs in four straight games. 

Bill Dewitt Jr., executive vice pre­ sident of the club, said the move was made because “we need a fresh start next year.’’ He said the club had no im m ediate candidates to replace 
Slater. 

Slater’s three-year contract expires at the end of May. Slater will not remain with the club, a club spokes­ man said.

Cougars lead 

TYLER (AP) — Defending Southwest Conference champion Houston, led by All-American Ed Fiori and Mike Booker, took the lead Friday in the SWC’s spring golf championship. 
Fiori and Booker led all individuals with one- under-par 71s to pace the Cougars to a seven-stroke lead in the team competition over Texas A&M. 
Houston has a 288 total to 295 for the Aggies. 
Only three players besides Fiori and Booker were able to equal or break par on the Briarwood Country 
Club layout in Tyler. Cougar John gstark, Bobby 
Baugh of Texas Christian and Monte Schaller of 
Texas A&M all shot even-par 72s. 
Following Houston and A&M in the team compe­ tition were Southern Methodist 3o1, Texas 3o2, TCU 
3o3, Arkansas and Texas Tech 3o4, Rice 3o9 and 
Baylor 314. 
The final two rounds will be played Saturday and 
Sunday. 

Dan Cook 

Cousin Armadillo enjoyed his day 

Roy Harris has now made the full turn. The country kid has become a city slicker. The boxer who used to ask for extra passes is now the promoter, putting a squeeze on freebies. 
Come to think of it, despite his serious and sincere attitude, maybe there always was a layer of sly promoter to be found in 
Roy. It’s just that nobody bothered to peel back the country surface. 
There can be no question that the rubes of Cut and Shoot, Texas hood-winked the visiting slicksters back in 1958 when Roy was preparing to fight for the heavyweight boxing championship of the world. 
Maybe they got the idea from Primo 
Cam era. When the handlers of that giant from Italy decided to introduce their man to the New York press they staged it better than Frank Buck’s re­ turn with Garganthua. Poor Primo was fed a diet of three dozen palookas while they padded his record and fattened his confidence. 

Then they tagged him “The Ambling 
Alp,’’ slipped him into shoes three sizes too large and handed him an iron walking cane. When Camera got out of the taxi he was wearing and dropped his cane on cue it sounded like two manhole covers colliding with marble. 
The New York press went bananas over boxing’s newest brute. 

But Harris’ handlers put a different twist on things in July of ‘58. They hauled the writers to the fighter—in 
Cut and Shoot. 
Roy was preparing to meet Floyd 
Patterson for the title and typewriter 
.jockeys from Los Angeles to New York 
City jumped at the chance to spend a weekend at a boxing camp in a Texas community called Cut and Shoot. What a natural. No Hollywood script writer would have had the brass to try and pass that off as good fiction. But this was for real. 

Well, almost for real. It was about as real as some of the country characters who paraded through Roy’s backyard gym. Cousin Armadillo got almost as much play as Roy as he sashayed ar­ ound picking his teeth with a 12-inch frog-sticker. There was always some member of the Harris family hurling knives at trees or stumps. 

On the second day of that press visit 
Cousin Armadillo, not to be outdone, made the scene with an ancient pistol poking from his belt. Some of the eas­ tern writers jumped on that with much enthusiasm. You would have thought that Armadillo was the last survivor of the OK corral and smoke, was still settling. 
'I t was no matter that closer members of the Harris clan seemed to look upon their cousin with a mild degree of scorn. Perhaps he got his name after losing a two-out-of-three tussle with an arthritic armadillo. Who cared? Hwas the hottest boxing cop of the day and nobody denied that he was helping to sell Roy, not to mention a lot of tickets to Roy’s fight. 
W hite ligh tnin g 

When the press bus, loaded with about 
3o distinguished and semi-distinguished writers, pulled to a stop in front of the Harris home, a beefy Harris relative headed the wel­ coming committee. 

Uncle Luke carried a five-gallon jug of home brew and he insisted, rather stoutly, that nobody set foot on Harris land without first taking a sip of his white lightning. Nobody could handle two sips. Not being mach of an auth­ ority on any juice that comes without a stamp, I guessed that Uncle Luke had crossed tractor radiator water with enflam ing fluid to come ap with the headliner in his welcome wagon. That staff cured pimples and opened sin­ uses before it even settled. 

At any rate, a good time was had by 
'all and Roy even sparred and whacked 

 punching bags to delight the visitors. 
Never in the history of boxing did a mediocre challenger get more national publicity for a bout with a mediocre champion. The gimmick, of course, was Cut And Shoot, about 9o acres of woods on the outskirts of Conroe, Tex­ as. 

They said it was in the “ heart of 
T exas’ piney woods’’ and visiting journalists grabbed that meaty matter and converted it into poetry, of a sort. 
It didn’t matter that the piney woods actually started about 4o miles up the road, a wee bit northeast of Cut and 
Shoot. None of us visiting Texans cared to spoil the plot. Spoil it? Heck, we became part of it. 

And when the moment of truth arrived 
Roy did right well in Dis Angeles. He became one of many to deck Patterson in an early round hut Floyd returned to stop Harris in the 12th. So much for the legend of the unbeatable men of Cut and Shoot. 

Schoolteacher 

Some were a bit surprised when Roy began a schoolteacher after hanging up the gloves. Then, if memory serves, he took a turn in politics and held some sort of office in Conroe. 

But now he’s back in Houston. Last month he took out a license to promote boxing in that large neck of the woods. 
And where will his first show be held? 
How about the semi exclusive country club called the Woodlands? On the tennis courts, no less. That show is set for Monday night. 

Don’t ask if Cousin Armadillo w ill be on hand for the festivities. If he's still around and can locate the proper props, a sizeable knife and some rope-drawn jeans, hell be there. 
But then, ifs been 19 years since the outside world has heard from Arma­ dillo. Maybe, like Roy, he’s squared up since that press conference in Cut and 
Shoot. Why, he might even be an exe­ cutive today, selling men’s purses and hair spray in Deer Park. Folks do change, you know.

Ogg’s beach bill should get stuck 

State Sen. Jack Ogg of Hous­ ton has introduced a bill, S.978, to close all the Gulf beaches in 
Texas to vehicular traffic. 

The measure deserves to get stuck in the quagmire of political red tape, not just because it would prohibit thou­ sands of residents from using the beaches, but also because it would place an intolerable financial burden on a state agency that has no business being in the beach policing business. 
Ogg wants to close all the beaches to cars, dune buggies, anything with a motor on it. then have the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department study all the beaches for several months to deter­ mine which should remain closed and which could be opened. 

Ogg insists that the department also 

 should provide access roads and free parking, plus a free launching ramp here and there, where access roads, parking and ramps do not exist. 

The financially strapped Parks and 
Wildlife Department needs this kind of burden like it needs to go back into the bobwhite quail business. 
There are several reasons Ogg’s proposal has little merit. One, the 
Parks and Wildlife Department, which has state parks on Galveston and 
Mustang Islands, already has the beaches in the parks closed to vehicu­ lar traffic. 
Second, the National Park Service, which now controls about 8o beach miles along Padre Island, seems to be perfectly capable of handling beach traffic problems without the help of 
Parks and Wildlife or the Texas legis­ lature. 
Third, individual counties have authority to regulate beach traffic, and even if some of the commissioners courts have been lax about regulating it, the authority is there, it only needs to be exercised. 
Ergo: No additional laws are needed to further clutter up cluttered penal codes. 

The danger of exotics 

Ranchers thinking about stocking a few exotic big game animals where they also want white-tailed deer ought to think again. Exotics such as as axis and sika deer might threaten the very

 existence of whitetails. 
Parks and Wildlife biologist D. 
E.Harmel of the department s 
Kerr Management Area in the Hill 
Country says the exotics have a much higher survival rate than whitetails. 
Biologists on the Kerr Area began a study of exotics when placed in direct competition with whitetails back in 
197o. Results of the study show that whitetails get the short end of the stick. 

Three 96-acre traps were used in the 

 experiment. One trap contained noth­ ing but whitetails. A second contained a similar brood herd of whitetails, plus axis deer. The third held whitetails and sika deer. 

The ratio by species apparently rocked along fairly well until 1976. 
That year, the control enclosure con­ taining only whitetails started the year with ll deer and ended it with 14, an increase of three. 
Whitetails in the other two traps suffered. The count in trap number two on Jan. I, 1976, was ll whitetails and 19 axis. At the end of the year, the count was six whitetails and 14 axis. 
In trap number three, the count at the beginning of ‘76 was .seven white­ tails and 27 sika. Twelve months later, the whitetails were down to six in number, the sika up to 31. 
The missing animals did not escape. 
Nor were they shot. They simply died. 
They could not compete.for available food with the other animals. 

They’ve seen it before 

Several ranchers who ha\e main­ tained herds of exotics for a number of years have watched whiptail deer de­ cline as the exotics increased. 
And this, in one respect — an im­ portant respect, is unfortunate, be­ cause neither the magnificent axis nor the mediocre sika is nearly as wary. as challenging to hunt, as a trophy class white-tailed buck. ie it ie 
By the same token, bighorn sheep can’t compete with wild burros in the west. and a decision by Interior Secre­ tary Cecil Andrus to delay a planned burro eradication effort in Grand 
Canyon National Park until the park service can complete “ a full enviro- mental impact statement” isn’t doing bighorn herds much good. 

“ Strong public reaction to the plan, 

 described in an environmental assess­ ment issued last December, shows the wisdom of seeking more detailed and specific information on the effect of the plan on environmental resources,” 
Andrus said. 

“ It is not known what Andrus meant by ‘environmental resources,’ but sur­ ely he was not referring to bighorn sheep and other wildlife populations that arc being demolished by the bur­ ros,” said an official with the Wildlife 
Management Institute. . 
“ There is no ‘wisdom’ in letting ex­ otic animals raze valuable native wildlife populations just because there is a public reaction to killing the bur­ ros. 
. 
“ There always is public reaction against killing anything. Interior is responsible for protecting wildlife in 
Grand Canyon and will be held ac­ countable for its actions’ effect on na­ tive wildlife.”

 said that a state district judge had issued a temporary injunction, rilling that the team must play to establish a score.” 
Roosevelt won the AA A A competi­ tion with a 729, though the Crockett 
'team had a tremendous first round by themselves Friday. 
“ I am not going to let the score count,” emphasized Bliss, who again pointed out that the judge merely said that a score had to be established. “ I am going to file a report that Roosevelt won and Harlingen finished second.” 
Bliss said he felt that he made a sound decision and rightly so since Dr. 
Bailey Marshall, UIL athletic director, agreed. 
MacArthur (756) and East Central 
(769) finished behind Harlingen at 75o. 

Cinders 

Meanwhile, back at Buccaneer Sta­ dium San Antonio teams were making their preseence felt on the cinders. 
Houston's sprint relay, composed of 
Sherine Taylor, Betty Pinnix, Shirley 
O’Neal and Toy Roberts, shattered the existing sprint relay mark of 48.9 in its best performance of the season at 48 8. 
Taylor also set an individual mark in the 8o-yard hurdles only minutes after 
Krissy Terpening broke the old mark with a 1o.8 by breaking the tape at 1o.7. 
Holmes, another San Antonio team with numerous entries, qualified, like 
Houston, in both the sprint and 88o relays. And for insurance the Holmes lasses also qualified their mile relay. 
Qualified 
MacArthur^ L ’ Anna Howard quali­ fied in both the IOO arid 22o dashes finishing second and first, respectively, in her heats at 11.5 and 
25.8. Houston’s Debra Pinnix posted the best preliminary time in that event with a 25.3 clocking. 
MacArthur^ Beverly Porter and 
Memorial’s Verlena Mooney carried the top two times in the 44o dash to the finals crossing the line at 59.2 and 59.4. respectively. 
Because there are only eight AAA schools in Region IV, preliminaries were needed in only the 8o-yard hur­ dles Friday in that division. 
The AAA field event finals were completed Friday afternoon and Gre- gory-Portland jumped out to the lead at 28 points with the running finals coming Saturday. 
Austin Westlake held a close second with 22, followed by New Braunfels 
Canyon (17), Belton (15), New Braun­ fels (15), Kerrville Tivy (14), Del Valle 
(14) and Calallen (12). 
New 
Braunfels standout 
Nell 
Fortner, who owns a best of 5-5 in the high jump this season, finished a dis­ appointing third, clearing 5-o. Fortner passed on the first two heights (the competition started with the bar at 4-6) cleared 5-o. missing at 5-1 three times. 
In the AAAA ranks, it is hard to speculate which team had jhe best 

• chance of taking the regional title be­ cause entries and places according to preliminary times were split greatly.

Braves, 6-5 
ATLANTA (AP) — Craig Robinson’s bases-loaded single capped a two-run rally in the ninth inning that gave the 
Atlanta Braves a 6-5 victory over Los 
Angeles Friday night and snapped the 
Dodgers’ seven-game winning streak 
Robinson’s hit ended a game that was delayed by rain three times in the lute innings for a total of 82 minutes 
The Braves’ rally started when Los 
Angeles reliever Charlie Hough walked 
Jerry Royster and Willie Montanez singled off loser Stun Wall, o-1. 
After Jeff Burroughs forced Mon­ tanez, pinch hitter Joe Nolan singled 
Royster home with the tying run and a walk loaded the bases.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday April 23 1977- 
Tire machine prototype built 

Southwest Re asearch 
Institute has developed a prototype automated tire inspection machine with a drive-through design intended for use in as­ sembly line automotive inspection stations of the future. 
SwRI developed the system in a program conducted for the Na­ tional Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. 
Project Engineer J. E. 
Johnson presented the system Friday during the lith 
Sym posium of 
Nondestructive Evalua­ tion at the El Tropicano 
Motor Hotel. 
The triple-function in­ spection device is capa­ ble of discovering inter­ nal flaws in a tire car­ cass. determ ining the depth of rem aining tread, and setting infla­ tion pressure, Johnson said. 
Tire carcass integrity is checked by a mechan­ ical vibration method. 
The inspection machine is designed to check two tires at a time, mounted on the car. 
Complex patterns of vibration are set up in the tire body, and the tire ’s responses are m easured by the two sidewall sensors. 
Flaws are revealed by a difference in signals from the two tra n s­ ducers. 
“Tire defects such as tread chunking, uneven wear, broken cords, and separations will affect the local resonant vibra­ tion properties and will, in general, upset the re­ sponse locally as com­ pared to nonflawed ar­ eas.” Johnson said. 
The prototype machine can perform a complete inspection of two tires simultaneously in about two m inutes, Johnson said. 
The overall vehicle in­ spection system this ma­ chine was designed to fit, a concept under federal study, could be developed to perform an automated diagnostic inspection.

Young hates to deal with 
South Africa 

WASHINGTON (AP) - 
U.N. Am bassador An­ drew Young said Friday that he hates to have an­ ything to do with the governm ent of South 
Africa. 
“ And y et,” the con­ troversial official said, ‘‘I know that if s in our in­ terest and in the interest of the majority of the peo­ ple in that country to m aintain some kind of relationship and in­ fluence.” 
Young told a Foreign 
Serv ice Association lun­ cheon group that by m aintaining ties with 
South Africa the United 
States can help evolve policies “ that contribute to things we hold dear.” 
He said “compromising as little as possible is 

 inayoe the challenge we face.” 
Asked why the admin­ istration wants to have relations with Laos’ re­ pressive regime. Young said “we are reluctant to cut off all contact” because it might be in the long-range interest of the people of such countries for the United States to have diplomatic ties. 
“ T hat’s the delicate balance,” Young said. He went on: 
“Ifs no joke I feel that way about South Africa — that I hate anything to do with that government.” 
Last week Young re ­ sponded “ yeah” when asked in an interview with 
The Associated P ress whether the 
South 
African government was illegitimate..

Monte Carlo given new look by p a ir 

Down in Florida there is a fellow named Jon Tedeseo who thinks he can build a better looking car than 
General M o to rs. 
Sn Jon and his partner. Gerard Schain- uck. formed a firm called Jon/Gerard to tra n s fo rm mass produced C hevrolet 
Monte Carlos into unique one-of-a-kind tars. 
Now whether or not the Classic < ouch. as they call the ir recreation, is better looking than the Chevy is a m atter of judgement. 
The original conversion looked so much like a Rolls-Royce the B ritish firm went Ut court and slopped production. After much consultation the Rolls people agreed not to object to the current design. 
Most of the changes in the car are done with fiberglass, and they w ill be happy to sell you a fully converted Classic Coach ll tor about $1o,ooo. 
Kit costs $1,695 
If you are good with tools and want to do the conversion yourself, they w ill sell you a kit for only $1,o95. t'n lik e many kit companies. Tedeseo says his company provides the whole package — the buyer is not forced to buy a lot of options that are really necessities. 
It would seem unlikely that GM has anything to w orry about. Most people consider the Monte Carlo a better looking car than its more expensive conversion. 
But for the person who wants something unique, the C lassic Coach is unique, without a question.

The “ Cinderella Car” and the “ Silent 
Screamer” — two racing cars driven in the Indianapolis 59o races by Mario An­ t e " ! and Parneiii Jones “ are on display on me tirst floor of the Smithsonian s 
National Museum of History and Techno­ logy and w ill be exhibited through Labor 
Day. 
Marin Andretti’s Hawk, which he drove to his Indianapolis 5oo v ictory in 19o9. was designed by Clint Brawner and powered by a turbo-charged Ford engine. 
The sleek red car received its nickname 
"Cinderella Car" when it was jerked out of storage after the wheel hubs failed on the STP Lotus which Andretti was to have driven in the race. 
Back up car 
The STP Hawk was then a three-year- old back-up car. 
Andretti jumped into the Hawk at the last minute, qualified it in the second spot and won over Dan Gurney and Bobby 
Fuser by a narrow margin. 
The “ Silent Screamer” driven by Par­ neiii Jones in the 19o7 Indy 5oo race be­ came one of the most controversial cars in the history of auto racing. 
This STP-Turbocar was fitted with a light weight Pratt & Whitney turbine en­ gine and was housed in a wishbone frame of enormous strength. 

It ran on kerosene instead of exotic racing fuel, and led every lap only to fail on the 197th lap with a broken gearbox bearing, finishing in sixth position. 
The car aroused a storm of controversy by those who cla im e d it was such a super-car it obsoleted all other Indiana­ polis racing machines. 
STF donations 
The two cars were donated to the mu­ seum bv tilt* STP Corp. 
Donald Berkebilel, curator of motor ve­ hicles. arranged for the cars to lie exhi­ bited and is actively seeking other racing vehicles to add to tile museum’s collec­ tions.

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS NEW S 
LAGOS, Nigeria — This capital city has a unique way of handling traffic violators during peak hours. 
Motorists are pulled from their vehicles and beaten with a three-foot long horse­ whip called a Kobokos. 
T ra ffic jam s are so bad cars w ith even-numbered plates alternate w ith odd-numbered plates on certain days. 
Nigerians driving on the wrong days have to pay $1oo to get their cars back. 

Based on the philosophy that one dissa­ tisfied customer is one too many. Tom 
Benson Chevrolet has embarked on a long-range custom er satisfaction pro­ gram that already had earned the San 
Antonio dealer General Motor’s Service 
Supremacy Award, a distinction held by less than IOO other Chevrolet dealers nationwide. 
The award, which consists of 22 silver medallions, was won bv the Tom Benson staff for meeting 22 rigid standards of service and passing a final inspection by a 
GM team that carefully quizzed scores of customers on the kind of service they received. 
The 22 requirements included employe training, better tools and equipment, an im proved custom er reception area, customer follow-up, availability of parts. increased productiv ity and more efficient work scheduling. 
Long-term program 
Many of these requirem ents were al­ ready being met, and all now have been incorporated in a long-term customer sa­ tisfaction program to include the Tom 
Benson Safety Club, an owner retention program and Mr. Goodwreneh. a national advertising program, the budget of which is second only to Chevrolet’s 1977 national advertising expenditures. rile Goodwreneh program is of special interest to Tom Benson, president of the dealership, who, as a m em ber of the 
Dealers Advisory Council of General Mo­ tors Parts Division, advocated the adver­ tising schedule for San Antonio.

In addition to being certified by the

'I’he auto people who worry about the appearance of the instrument panel, the color of the carpeting or the texture of Hu* seats are rapidly coming into their own. 
They call them interior designers and for most of the auto's long history they have been runner-up to the exterior de­ signers in public importance. 
The day may uut be far away when customers w ill be color-keying the car exteriors to match the inside decor, the 
Autom otive In fo rm a tio n Council sug­ gests. 
One of tin1 most distinctive differences that set top of the line emeries apart front the base or standard offerings in today's cars arc the interiors. The influence is so great interior snecialists are now truns-

 forming the pickup truck and even the van into objects of attractiveness. 
The fact that nearly half the drivers today are women probably has had the greatest effect on interior changes for the better. 
It isn’t just the eye appeal that has brought tne changes about. 
Years ago. manufacturers found out that certain types of upholstery snagged or were not exactly com patible w ith various furs. 
An interior designer for one auto maker believes the industry is at the beginning of a normal nine-year cycle in interior design. 
For the future, he says so-called bench scat w ill decline in favor of seats thai can be individually adjusted.

AUTO TALK 

Continued from Page I F many These involved direct and indirect visibility, windshield defogging, im- proved windshield wiper/washers and head restraints. 
These standards would only slightly improve the equipment already on the 
German cars, as well as other cars pro­ duced in the European Common Market. 
Law not enforced 
Like most European countries, Ger­ many has a mandatory seat belt use law', but the Germans don’t enforce it. Their death rate would be reduced by enforce­ ment if the experience of other countries can be used as a yardstick. 
There is a strong movement to get mandatory seat belt use laws in the Unit­ ed States. Highway deaths and injuries would go down dramatically, almost overnight, if people would only use the belts already in their cars. 
There is a safety law in Sweden that ought to be adopted here. 
The law requires that all children under the age of 13 must ride in the back seat. 
Hardly a day goes by that I don’t see some mother driving down I he street w ith her child, not only in the front seat with her, but standing up! 
A standing child in the front seat of a 

 tar can be seriously injured, or even killed, in a situation of a severe braking. 
• A law of this type would not be hard to enforce, but like the seat belt use law, it’s something we should do just out of com­ mon sense. 
The engineers at Daimler-Benz are especially critical of U.S. standards re­ quiring energy absorbing bumpers, side guard beams and head restraints. 
After a lot of testing, they sell their cars over here too. They concluded the bumpers were only helpful in collisions of three to six miles an hour. 
Their previous bumpers prevented da­ mage at speeds of three miles an hour or less. They also concluded the energy bumper is virtually useless at speeds over six miles an hour. 
The Daimler-Benz engineers also reached the conclusion the federally mandated bumpers not only increased car repairs, but also resulted in increased insurance premiums. 
The bumpers are not worth what they cost, or, in governmentese, they arc cost ineffective. 
I’ve been going over my notes of the news conference held by William o. 
Bourke, executive vice presidebt-Eord 
North American Automotive Operations, at the introduction of the Lincoln Ver­ 

 sailles in Los Angeles last month. 
Bourke spent several years with Ford’s overseas operations in many countries, including the United Kingdom. 
When he first came back to this country he remarked, “ I’ve come back and I have the feeling that I have traded the British labor movement for the U.S. Congress and I think I got the worse of the deal.” 
He said he did not think that statement expressed a great deal of optimism about the outlook in this country, but he added, 
“ With all its problems I’ll take this si­ tuation here.” 
The situation he was referring to here is best expressed, he said, by a line now making the rounds in Detroit: 
“ Congress told us they would design a car called the ‘Washington Runabout’, hut they didn’t promise they would buy IO million of them if the public doesn’t like it.” 
What Ford is doing, and what they hope the public will like, is to completely downsize all of their cars. 
Bourke said the cost is simply stagger­ ing. 
In 1977 and the following three years 
Ford worldwide capital expenditures for facilities and tools will be more than 
$8-billion, with by far the biggest chunk going to North America.

This latest economic forecast was included in an analysis sent to 
Congress on Friday that also included a budget deficit revised sharply, downward. Lance said the deficit is now ex­ pected to be $48.7 bil­ lion, $19.3 billion less than had been anticipated in 
Fe­ bruary. 

The administration's scrapping of the $5o rebates and business tax incentives account­ ed for $12.2 billion of the decrease, while an­ other $6.1 billion came from lesser government spending than had been estimated in February. 

Wednesday, the Com­ merce 
Department released figures putting the gross national 

 product for the first quarter of 1977 at an annual rate of 5.2 per 
• cent. The same figures showed an inflation rate of 5.8 per cent for the year. 
In a message to Con­ gress, Lance said the latest figures for con­ sumer price rises and 
ONP do not include the effects of the severe cold weather in Ja n ­ uary and February br the continued drought in the West. But he said the budget office believed the over-all ef­ fects of the cold weather would be tem­ porary and small, and. that subsequent reports on the economy, in­ cluding retail sales, in­ dustrial production and employment strongly support that view.

COMPILED (BO M WIRE SERVICES 
SEOUL — A new con­ frontation between South 
Korean President Park 
Chung Hee and his op­ ponents has resulted in the detention of more than 5o dissidents — 2o of whom remain in jail — w ithin the la st two weeks. 
Five of them, including the son of the Rev. Kim 
Kwan Suk, general se ­ cretary of the National 
C ouncil of 
C hristian 
C hurches, have been indicted on charges of violating the nation’s an- ti-C om m u n ist law , sources here revealed. 
It was the first time since prosecutors in 1975 accused the internation­ ally known poet, Kim Chi 
Ha, now serv in g a se ­ ven-year jail term, that any known non-Communist had been indicted under the strin­ gen t an ti-C om m u n ist law, which carries pen­ alties up to death. 
The K orean g o v ern ­ ment itself, which made the detention and arrests w ithout w arran ts and cen so rs the n a tio n ’s press, has made no an­ noun cem ent of the detention or the indict­ m ents. They were car­ ried out in a crackdown on an underground m ovem ent seek ing sig ­ natures for a petition calling for restoration of democracy. 

LLS. big iii 
Rhodenia talks 
LONDON - U.S. and 
British diplom ats have agreed on a new set of tactics aimed at ending the gu errilla war and achieving black majority rule in Rhodesia. 
The key elem ent calls for the close involvement of the United States in every negotiating step, thereby exploiting what one B ritish diplom at called W ashington’s poli­ tica l clou t with both black and white leaders in southern Africa. 
Other new steps in the plan, la rg ely the han­ diwork of David Owen, the British foreign min­ ister, are: 
Leapfrogging any tran­ sition governm ent and moving directly to a con­ ference that will write a constitution providing a majority rule, and seek­ ing agreement on central points of the constitution through separate, b ila­ teral ta lk s w ith rival black and white leaders before any conference is held.

San Antonio EXPRESS-N EW S— Saturday April 23 1977 
Hopp’s began with shop in boy’s room 

FORECAST 

Its beginning was sim­ ple enough. 
A lot of teen-age boys like to earn money with hobbies or selling skills. 
But Anoil Hopp was quite a bit more ambitious than the average youth in 
1936. 
He loved to read about radios and quickly showed a talent for mak­ ing them work. He set up the beginning of what is now Hopp’s Television and Appliance Centers in a room in his boyhood 
Porter Street home. 
While he encountered some resistance at first because of his delicate 

 age, word soon spread that the youngster could indeed repair radios, even though he was only 
14 years old. 
“ It was not uncommon to have a customer come in for service, but after seeing me decide I was too young to work on radios,” Hopp recalls. 
In 1942. Hopp’s Radio 
Shop set up its own headquarters, 2311 S. 
Hackberry. The store still operates today in modern facilities. 
Lean years took their toll on the business, and for a time Hopp took an­ other job to make ends 

Krueger calls for rights for disabled 

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS-NEWS 
W ASHINGTON — I S. Rep. Bob Krueger Friday called for nondiscrimination against handicapped persons participating in federally assisted social service programs. 
Krueger sent a letter to Joseph Califano. secretary of Health. Education and Welfare. 
“ Our 28 million disabled citizens are still waiting for the regulations of section 5o4 (of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973) to be enforced. 
“ The approval of these regulations would mark an important step toward the broad accessibility of social services to all segments of the general public. 
“ The Carter administration has spoken clearly in defense of human rights. Certainly, the disabled people of our country have rights and talents, too, and could greatly benefit our society through their greater participation.” Krueger said.

 meet. His wife, Mary 
Boa. ran the shop during the day, then Anvil would spend nights repairing radios. 

Television 

But business grew and 
Hopp returned to the store full-time. When television came into the picture, Hopp’s began selling and servicing 
TVs. adding air condi­ tioners and major ap­ pliances in 1949. 
Over the years, stores have been added at 26oo 
West Ave., 1533 Austin 
Hwy., Wonderland, Cen­ tral' Park, 9o2 SW Mili­ tary Drive and 12o3 Pat 
Booker Road in Univer­ sal City. 
Today Anvil Hopp is chairman of the board while Herb Fry serves as president, as the com­ pany marks its 41st an­ niversary. 
Nance 
Allison, daughter of the founder and Hopp's advertising manager, attributes 
Hopp’s growth to person-, alized service, continu­ ing after the sale. 

School 

“ Our salespeople go to schools so they can know what they’re selling and help the customer select the right TV or appliance for their needs,” Mrs. 
Allison explained. 
“ For example, in our 
‘Man from Hopp’s’ pro­ gram, one of our people goes to the home, mea­ sures it and computes the exact size air conditioner a family needs,” she pointed out.

Beanie is not beaming 

MHW YORK (AP) - 
Mayor 
Abraham 
Beanie was honored, in a manner of speaking, when some Brooklynites dedicated their “ pot-hole of potholes” to him in protest against city street conditions. 

The informally organ­ ized Bay Ridge Pot Hole 
Committee has been painting circles around local pot holes to make them more visible. 

They had painted rings around 9o of them when they came on a monster cavity, 12 feet long. 5 feet wide, and 3V& feet deep. 

A spokesman for the 
Highway epartment said Friday, “ We don’t call this a pot hole; we call it an excavation.” He said the city would cover the sinkhole with a steel plate, but gave no date. 

One committee member said, “ I’d like to see the pot holes go the way of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers — either to 
California or just any­ where out of town.”

Many who would not take the last cookie would take the last lifeboat. 
In the play of today’s in­ te re s tin g gam e, W e s t’s penalty double of three hearts warned declarer that it was time to go for the lifeboats. However, one false move in the play of the heart suit and declarer would wind up in the drink. 
Observe how Theodore 
Kurrus timed the play to make his tricky game. Kur-1 rus, a far Eastern affairs ex­ pert and newspaper feature w riter on a China series,' played today’s hand during one of his trips to Singapore. I 

The opponents were very ! accommodating with their penalty and lead directing doubles. Usually, with misfits of this type, North and South have difficulty in not getting overboard. Fortunately, the penalty doubles warned of the dangers and South was able to stop at four spades. 

East won the ten and con­ tinued with the club king which South ruffed (East would have been much better off had he shifted to a heart instead of leading a second club). Trumps were drawn in three rounds and it was time to play hearts. 
If South had started with the heart ace and then the eight to West’s ten. a low heart exit by West would even tu ally produce three defensive heart tricks and 
IOO points for the defense. 
H owever, Kurrus knew where the hearts were and he started the suit by leading his eight. West was forced to win the ten and he had an insolu­ ble problem. He couldn’t lead diamonds to dummy’s ace and king, so he had to lead a heart. West's heart seven went to declarer’s nine and

Answer: Four hearts, a closeout bid. Maybe the hearts can be useful at no trump and maybe not. At four hearts, they are sure to yield some tricks.

South Texas skies are fair 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
An area of cloudiness moved across North Texas. Friday, but the rest of the state remained under fair skies bringing some relief after several days of heavy rains. 

The cloudy to partly cloudy skies were evident north of a Childress to 
Waco to Longview line. The cloudiness was moving east and on its way out of the state. 
Elsewhere skies were mostly fair with some high cloudiness evident in southwest portions of the state. 
Early afternoon temperatures ranged from 65 at Abilene to 8o at 

Victoria and Beaumont and Port Arth­ ur. 
The National Weather Service said it would be mostly fair and clear Satur­ day and Sunday.
