Southgate Fire Chief Dick Riesen- 

 berg said there were 12o known dead and more bodies inside the rubble when the fire was put under control shortly before I a.m. EDT Sunday . 
The fire chief blamed many (if the deaths on panic. He said a number of 

 people had been trapped inside the 
Beverly Hills Supper Club in this northwestern Kentucky com munity , just across the Ohio River from Cin­ cinnati.

Selling phony or worthless coal mine stock to the unwary appears to he the current hot item among swindlers in Tex as and elsewhere 
Con men working these coal scheim>s have mo\ed into South Tex as and the 
Houston area after having bilked peo-* pie in .some Southeastern slates, parti- enlarly Kentucky and Alabama, ae- eording to police. 
Many of the fraudulent oiieralors are lielieved to lie the same people who pre\ lousiy were oil drilling swindlers. represenlati\e of the Tex as Secur­ ities Commission said some of the pri- 
\ale offerings of coal mint* stock “ re­ 

 semble very much the offering of oil and gas stock.' 
William Hill, who li\es near EIukmi - dorf, said he had been contacted by an alleged broker, who told him he ha(l shares for sale in lignite m ines in 
South Tex as and Wy oming. 
“ My name was given the man by a cousin, who thought the guy was on the up-and-up,” Hill said. “ He asked for a minimum of $911o and said it was a sure thing. 

“ But when I (¡uesiioned him at length, he began getting angry and left my home in a huff,” Hill .said. 

,\ Houston attorney told the Ex - press-Nev\s one of his elients asked his advice about two weeks ago aliout 

 purchasing some coal mining opera­ tion stock. 
“ Having been the lawy er for another man who was cheated on an oil drilling scheme three y ears ago, I must say we cheeked out the eoal mining operation carefully ,“ he said, 
“The name of the company the man said he represented was not registered with the Secretary of State’s office nor was there any registration with the 
Tex as Securities Board, We eouid find nothing on the man nor the company ,“ he said. 
“ I advisi'd my client to forget the deal and said he probably should con­ tact the authorities.“ the attorney said.

The battle lines arc clearly drawn. 
The issue — whether homosex uals should be g ranted civil rig h ts in 
Miami—has split the metropolitan ar­ ea in two. .V special referendum on the issue will be held on June 7. 

The most conspicuous battier is 
Anita Bry ant, who has captured na­ tional attention with her outspoken 
\iews against any legal recognition of homosex ual rights. This Is the second of a two-part series about the battle.

Xot Anita Bry ant. 

She’s an uutdunrs girl who jugs, bikes and g<tes fishing with her family . 
At home, she enjoy s sitting in her garden — w heix * she and her husband raise orchids — sipping orange juice and kc('i)ing in toiieh with campaign head(|uar(i*rs via ex tension phone. 
S h e's still furious that Dude Coun­ ty 's homosex ual rights ordinance was nitrodneed bv a woman whose eandi- d a ry she’d endorsed.

................................. 

AN ITA BRYANT 

“ 1 know the ordinance sounds like just a civil rights things for homosex ­ uals. but it is giving sanction to an act that is not only immoral but illegal.” 
She is concerned that homosex ual teachers would have the legal right to flaunt themselves in front of children, and to show up for work “ in drag” — wearing clothes of the opposite sex . 

But the nub of the issue is whether or not homosex uals prey upon children. 
Miss Bry ant say s they do. Homosex ­ uals cannot reproduce biologically , she 

She claim s to have interview ed former homosex uals who support this statement. She .say s her only concern is to protect her children from ad­ vances by keeping homosex uals out of the teaching profession. 
A bumper sticker on her car say s: 
“There’s no human right to corrupt our children.” 
Miami homosex ual organizations say Miss Bry ant is grossly naive. 
“ There are already so many gay teachers that if they left the school sy stems of this country , the schools would fall apart,” say s Robert Kunst, director of the Miami Victory Cam­ paign. “ They ’re not out there recruit­ ing. They 're only out there to teach. 
How many parents would object to having their children taught by So­ crates or Plato or Gertrude Stein or 
Michelangelo or Leonardo da Vinci — ail known homosex uals? 
“ Her assumption that all a child has to do is see an upfront gay and he’ll l>ecome a homosex ual is a big slap in the face to the heterosex ual communi-

La wma ker: Press ta kes ^chea p sho ts’ 

WASHINGTON POST SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - Rep. David Obey. 
D-Wis.. accused the Washin gton press corps Frid ay of “cheap shot” journ alism that focuses more on attackin g con gress­ men for free parkin g privileges an d legis­ lative recesses than on major n ation al problems like “ the (iiiality of our air an d water, ed ucation an d health programs.” 
Obey, in an ad d ress to the Western 
Wiscon sin Press Association at Eau 
Claire, said man y reporlers like politi­ cian s — are “ susceptible to the same temptafion , tlie temptation to overd rama- tize. to overreach for stories an d hi*ud lin es an d , 1 am sorry to .say, jian d er to popular prejud ices." 
Free benefits 

While attackin g con gressmen for pcrq- uisities an d privileges of office, the press seld om men tion s. Obey said , all its own fr(*e ben efits from tlie govern men t which amoun t to “ way over $ 1 million a year.” 
These in clud e, he said : 
• Space an d equiiimen t in the House an d 
Sen ate press galleries, in clud in g the st‘r- vices of 24 employes to d istribute mail, an swer phon es, make press releases avai­ lable. keep equijimen t workin g, plus spe- eiu! d oorkeepers an d mi*ssen gers, all at a lota! cost of $ 592.517 in 1977. 
• 181 free reserved parkin g places on the Capitol groun d s worth roughly $ 13o.ooo 

 to the press, based on fees for comparable commercial space. 
• About 18o free telephon es costin g the govern men t $ 23.ooo a year. 
• Desks, chairs an d typewriters worth 
$ 4o,ooo. 
• Semi-private elevators, exclusive press d in in g rooms, free station ery, an d access to the same office supplies, meals an d barbers an d man y other facilities av ailable to con gressmen 
Obey said he d oesn ’t min d serious stories about con gression al waste, but he d oes object to the “ m isplaced satuTi- mon y” of a TV reporter, for example, 
“ who d oes a three-min ute n etwork clip on con gression al ‘perks’ such as free parkin g without ever gettin g aroun d to tellin g his viewers,that he himself has a free space on that same Capitol Hill.” 
Doesn 't the public have a right to kn ow if a scien ce writer has large hold in gs in d rug comjian y stocks? 

Obey said reporters in creasin gly ten d to emphasize superficial person ality storifs an d trivial revelation s of a “ titillatin g n ature at the expen se of serious issues. 
He said . “ Workin g reporters have told me that it is far easier to con vin ce their ed itors back home to make room for stories about the person al lives of members of Con gress than stories about the misd irection of the Occupation al Safe- 

 ty an d Health .Act. the waste of research d ollars at the Nation al Can cer In stitute, or the immen se social con sequen ces of the hun d red s of policy d ecision s foun d in an appropriation s bill for the Ht*alth, BMuca- lion s an d Welfare Departmen t “ 
Obey said that while “ cheap-shot artists in the press are in a d istin ct min ority.” there Is much to great a ten d en cy to d is­ tort. or stretch an d to emphasize the un importan t.

For exam ple, he said the House is

At one point. Councilm an Glen H artm an voiced puzzlement over certain aspects of a water board proposal, and Schaefer cam e back haug htily , “ if y our memory is vag ue, I sug g est y ou refresh it by reading the m aterial we g ave y ou.”

Councilman Rudy Ortiz, did in fact g o ahead and cast a mindless “ no” vote on the bond issue.

Today , almost II months later, that resolu­ tion for one reason or another rem ains dor­ mant. 

Meanwhile, with all the dark speculation about “ a Cry stal City takeover” at City Hall, 
Schaefer has to be rati'd as a walking powder keg .

And while the City Water Board technica lly is a crea ture o f City Ha ll. Scha efer a nd bo a rd ma tes ha v e a pro blem understa nding their inferio r po sitio n. 

He put a cap on his virtuoso performance after the sam e Councilman E ureste an­ nounced down the line that he would vote ag ainst an admittedly necessary sale of CWB bonds because he disliked Schaefer. 
“ In that case.” retorted the board ch air­ man, “ y ou will only be showing y our ig nor­ ance.” 
Whacko! No question but that the city will g o down the dum per in a h urry if council m em bers decide critical issues on the basis of 

This man mig ht well be the cataly st needed to turn w hat’s already a hig hly sensitive situation at City Hall into a blazing inferno, 
Schaefer, a developer, seem s tem peram en­ tally unsuited to play any kind of role at all in the g ive-and-take world of politics. He's the ty pe Paul Anka m ust have had in mind in composing the little num ber, “ I DID IT MY 
WAY!” 
His essential beef with City Hall has its roots in last J uly ’s council resolution to 

Councilman 
H artm an calls this 
“ an altitudinal deficiency .” and say s someHung must be done to “ correct it "

NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE vST. SIMONS ISLAND, Oa. - Presi­ dent Carter says that Secretary of 
State Cyrus R. Vance and Soviet For­ eign Minister Andrei Gromyko will discuss arms limitations in Geneva at least twice more by mid-Sept(*mber. 
The President had no spi'cific dates for the meetings but spoke optimisti­ cally of previous talks fietween the two men, “ I think we’ve got it back to the stage where actually, siuiously. we’re trying to find some eommon ground to reach an agreement,” he said. 
The I*resident said the recent remo­ val of Soviet President Nikolai V, 
Podgorny from that country’s ruling body strengthened the role of Soviet party chief I.eomd Brezhnev. 
He said he studied the possible im­ 

 pact of Podgorny's “ ouster” on his trip 
Friday to Cape Canaveral, f'la., for a nin*' hour cruise aboard the U.S.S. Los 
Angeles with his wife, Rosalyiin, and 
.\dm. llyman G. Hickoser. 
Carter’s annouucemcnt tif llu' con- tiniiation of the negotiations between th(‘ United Slates and the Soviet Union came in conversations F’riday night with reporters on his return here from the cruise aboard the nueleur submar­ ine in the Atlantic off the coast of 
Florida. 
Kickover, in a characteristic defense of the virtue of submarines, said, aboard the Los Angeles, that if Gt'r- many had had more of them in World 
War II, it probably would have won. 
“ He's probably right,” said the Presi­ dent.

ST. SIMONS LSLAND, 
Ga — President Uarler’s personal review of tlu' 
U.S. defen.se esta blish­ ment, which eurrii'd turn 
F'riday under the Atlantic* in a nuel(‘ar submarine, is likely to turn next to the Strategic Air Uom- mand. 
An intention to inspect the SAC luochpiarters in 
Omaha on his next trip west was mt'ntioned by 
Carter in a chat with re- fiorters as he flew back 
F'riday night after nine hours at sea off F lorida aboard the nuclear sub­ marine Los Angeles. 
The President said he likes to make personal inspections of pn»grams he studies on paper. 
He addtul, however, there were no firm plans for the trip, and aides said It was the first they had heard of it. 
They were unable to confirm a rc'port Carter will participate in a De­ m ocra tic fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles eommeinoraliiig his 53rd birthday on Oct. 1. 
Despite his strenuous day F'riday, Carter was up and out at H:ll a.m. 
Saturday for a day of fishing for bass and bream with three old friends on another of 
G eorgia ’s offshori' is­ lands. 
They caught 25 to 3{l,

Coiitinufd ironi Pa«<c lA and solar onor^ y srhoinos poppinii up. thrso ])romotors go for \vhato\or hot," said Tt'vas Socuntk's Com in 
Hu'hard laitham. 
Latham urged Texans to lie wary of any such get-rieh-quiek schemes. 
“ \Vc’\i* had some real crackdowns on companies and indi\iduals who liave bilked peojile out of millions of dollars in worthless Texas oil and gas wells in recent years." Latham said 
According to Latham, one method popular among con men in southern stall's operates like tliis; 
Tlie swindlers buy rigiits to mine or purchase land inxolved in played-out or unprofitable coal mines. 
They tell the owner of the land they ha\'c a large buyer, usually sa.\ing lie 

 is from out of the countr\, then they start the actual mining operation and sell stock. portion ot the mone\ taken in trom stock sales is used at first to appease the landowner, if that is necessary. 
Often It isn't. 
Because the mines are uiiprofituble, the company collapses, forcing bank- ruptcN proceedings The operators, with Iheir mining equipment, often 
>tolen, mo\e on to newer and greener l>astures. 
The landowner loses because he got little or.no monev from the land "sale” and those who bought the stocks lose because the "compan>" bought into evaporates they will ever rival Ihe oil drilling schemes, which he claims now are at a minimum. 
"B u t the word from some other states IS they have had many problems with coal mine swindlers This has bei'ii particuiarlv true in Alabama and 

Kentucky," he said 
He noted that in 1975 and 197(> a total ol HtH) cease and desist orders were issued against 16o so-called oil drilling companies in 33 slates. 
'I hi're were !5t) injunctions ordered by courts against another 13o com­ panies and 8o individuals, involved in the oil schemes, he said 
In Texas, during that period, there were 83 injunctions issued against 34 companies and 49 people i 
In addition to that, last year there were 11 criminal actions filed in Texas. 
In the oil schemes, some companies make a half-hearted stab at drilling. 
But the fraudulent operators rake off 
25 to 5o per cent of the money they have taken in slock for so-called expenses before drilling starts. 
Latham said his office is keeping in close contact with securities offices ol olhi'r states, observing the movements of coa) mine '^ wlndlers

REP. BILL SULLIVANT 
Sullivant aims for speaker 

A S S O C I A T E D PRESS 
AUSTIN - Rep. 
Rill 
Sullivant, 
D- 
Gainesville, formally announced Saturday as a candidate for 
Speaker of the House of the 1979 legisla­ ture. 
" I intend to run regardless of who else may be in the race," 
Sullivant told a news conference. 
Speaker B ill Clayton has announced that he will be seeking a third terpi and claims to have enough pledges to guar­ antee his election. 
Also in the 
1979 speaker’s race is Rep. 
Buddy Temple. D-Diboll 
Sullivant said he had supported Clayton during his first two terms and delayed his announ­ cement to avoid any dis­ ruption of this legislature. 
“ With this term. Bill 
Clayton will have served the stale for 16 years, four of that as speaker," he said. “ Whatever pro­ grams he had for the benefit of the Texas 
House and our state, we must assume he has had time to accomplish.” 
Sullivant said until recently he had assumed 
Clayton would not seek a third term, despite Clay­ ton’s earlier announ­ cement. 
Governor 
“ Mr. Clayton has said he wants to run for governor in 1982. This is a laudable goal. But I had thought he would agree that the people of Texas deserve more than for the speaker’s office to b e used as a place to hiber­ nate for four years while waiting the spring of an­ other statewide election year,” Sullivant told the news conference. 
“ The House need fresh new leadership to meet the needs of modern 
Texas.. . We have had 
(this session) govern­ ment by log-jam and cri­ sis. Very frankly, the 
House this session has been like a bus load of good old boys on a trip. 
And no one goes up front to see where we are going until the bus hits something.” 
Sullivant said he plans to travel throughout the state visiting with members and political candidates. 
Sullivant, 37, is a na­ tive of Gainesville. He was elected to the legis­ lature in 1972. Prior to that he was Cooke County attorney and district at­ torney. 
Also in the race is Rep. 
Buddy Temple, D-Dibull, generally regarded a.s a liberal. 
Pledges 

Sullivant said he had 46 pledges ~ but some of them are contingent upon 
Clayton’s not being a candidate. He said, how­ ever, that Clayton’s sup­ port is softening, 
“ In the past two weeks, several have advised me that they are no longer second pledges but are firsts,” Sullivant said. 
He indicated that the third term issue and the death of some members’ bills in the eorrimittee system had contributed to the switches that h(> claims are oeeurring.

W ILL controversy take a w a y A nita B ryan t’s desirability in the eyes of television sp onsors? 
GAY FIGHT 

( ontinued from Page IA 
(y. It says that heterosexual relations can’t he very attracti\e,” 
The Dade County Coalition, another homosexual organization, claims that far more children are the victims of heterosexual than homosexual attacks. 
•The Coalition says it supports laws making child seduction a crime. 
Miss Bryant is also bucking stiff op­ position from liberal organizations. In 
1975, the National Council of Churches declared that discrimination against homosexuals is morally wrong. And it urged churches to work for legislation that would guarantee the civ il rights of everyone, regardless of their sexual preferences. 
When Miss Bryant began her cam­ paign against homosexuals in Dade 
• ounty, Rev. G. William Shock of the 
National Council sent a sharp note, saying: “ The Save Our Children cam­ paign implies that human rights have to be earned and are only given to those persons who pass certain moral tests. 
“ Our Constitution states that rights are inalienable and are not based on social codes. When you grant human rights to a person you have not neces- sarilv granted approval of his lifestyle. 
“ The campaign also im plies that children are at the mercy of every role-model they come in contact vwth, and that every role-model has to meet all the standards of a set of parents. 
Should we ban teachers who smoke? Should we ban teachers who are divorced? Freedom of religion also means the freedom from having a single moral code imposed on all citi­ zens.” 
The American Psychiatric Associa­ tion has taken a similar position. 
Rebutta l 
Miss Bryant offers a strong rebuttal 
— clippings from homosexual publica­ tions. 
“ Fag Rag" says the aim is to turn half the population “ g ay" by seduc­ tion, and gives a full page of explicit instructions on liovv to turn normal males into homosexuals. “ Gav crusader" recently published an arti­ cle which spoke glowingly of so­ meone s sexual relations with a three-year-old boy. 
Mrs. Shack, sponsor of the Dade 
County gay rights ordinance, claims

 the 3(j cities which have passed similar legislation. 
That's not true. 
In 1974. Minneapolis adopted an or­ dinance that grants homosexuals free­ dom from discrimination in areas of housing and em ploym ent. Shortly alter, a “ M r. Johnson” presented him self to the M inneapolis 
Big 
Brothers as a prospective volunteer. 
Big Brothers is an organization that finds men to act as companions for fatherless boys. 
Johnson gave as a reference a known homosexual rights advocate. Ques­ tioned on this point. Johnson admitted to being a homosexual. 
Because of the c ity ’s anti-discrimination ordinance, he was nonetheless accepted as a volunteer. 
But before matching him up with any child. Big Brothers decided they had an obligation to tell mothers of John­ son s sexual preferences and allow them to decide if they wanted a homosexual companion for their chil­ dren. 
Johnson protested to the Minneapolis 
Department of Civil Rights that pass­ ing along such information was a vio­ lation of his civ il rights. 
A civil rights staff decision was made ordering Big Brothers: 
• 
To stop inform ing mothers of 
Johnson's homosexuality. 
• To begin advertising m homox- sexual publications for additional vo­ lunteers, 
• To pay Johnson for damages, 
• To send its staff to study homo­ sexuality at a center called “ Gay 
House.” 
Big Brothers appealed this decision to the civil rights commissioners, and

An encounter that a woman claims she had with actress Shelley Winters at a 
Beverly Hills health club was not the kind of treatment usually sought in 
Such a place. 
Ellen Oher, in a suit filed in Superior 
Court, seeks $3oo,ooo damages from 
Miss Winters. She claims the actress beat her with hands and fists at the club restaurant last February, causing her to seek medical treatment. 

 won a reversal on all points. 
But Johnson is now appealing his case to the courts. 

The Miami dispute has caused ou­ trage on both sides of tin* issue. 
Mrs. Shack says she has received abusive phone calls and letters and can’t understand why “ Some people who attack homosexuality on moral grounds can use pornography to de­ fend their position.” 
In California, Miss Bryant has be­ come the target of obscene T-shirt slo­ gans. At home, she has been the target of bomb threats 
There have also been attempts to organize orange juice boycotts. “ How can they attack somebody’s livelihood?” she asks. “ Some of those people run massage parlors and places like that, lint I wouldn’t think of trying to run them out of business because of a political difference. What kind of people arc they!” 
Miss Bryant's foray into sexual poli­ tics had been easily. Last May, she earned $3(1,ooo in personal appearance lees. This May, she earned nothing. 
Two conventions she was booked to appear before in June have cancelled her act. She won't reveal which con­ ventions they are. Especially stinging was the cancellation she received from llu1 Singer sewing machine company. 
M iss Bryant's burning ambition has been to have a TV show of her own, and she was thrilled hist year when she was offered a contract by Singer to do u pilot program to be called “ Sew.” 
She was to act as hostess, sing, and interview dress designers, discussing fabrics and sewing techniques. Singer calls it a “ Dinah Shore-type sh ow .” 
Assura nces 
Miss Bryant says that just before she was to start shooting the pilot, she re­ ceived a call from Barry Drueker. producer of the show, assuring her that when she arrived in New York she would he given a contract to do not only 
(he pilot. but I he full series of six shows. Drueker no has “ no comment” on that telephone conversation. 
A few days later. Drueker sent her a telegram say ing she’d become too controversial and that Singer would not go on with the show. The telegram was sent with the blessing of someone at Singer. 
The following day, M iss Bryan t called a press conference to announce the cancellation and to suggest that it was the result of pressure tactics from homosexual organizations. 
Irate American housewives by the thousands bombarded Singer with let­ ters of outrage. Even newspapers that had editorialized against Anita at­ tacked Singer. Within a week. Singer issued a statement that top-manage- ment had overruled the original de­ cision, and hoped that negotiations with Miss Bryant could continue. 
A Singer spokesman says top man­ agement had anticipated the problem and had decided in advance that Miss 
Bryant s political activity was none of their business — but that this decision had not filtered down to the person who cancelled the show. 
No t the sa me 
Newspapers across the country re­ ported that Singer hud recanted — and the angry mail stopped. But M iss 
Bryan t’s husband. Bob Green, says that all is not us it appears to be. He says that Singer is now offering a con­ tract for just the one pilot program. 
“ Where.” he asks, “ is the contract to produce the six shows we were promised?” 
Green says it looks like a ploy by 
Singer to escape the heat — that once a pilot is made, they’ll find some reason lor not liking it and will scrap the vv hole project. 
Miss Bryant was to have been paid 
$7.5oo for the pilot and $5,ooo for each of llu* six shows. 
So far, her contract with the Florida 
Citrus Commission is not in jeopardy. 
“ Since we hired A n ita ,” said a spokesman, “ orange juice sales just keep going up and up.” It's not certain if that contract can withstand her go­ ing national with the “ Save Our Chil­ dren” campaign, as she vows. 
Ko ch b ill 
She's doing so partly because of a bill introduced in Congress this year by Rep. Edward Koch of New York which would outlaw discrim ination against homosexuals nationally. 
Another reason is that her work with 
Save Our Children” has exposed her to other areas of moral laxity. 
She broke into tears as she described her discovery that a book on ‘‘how to become a lesbian*’ was available to children in public libraries in the 
Miami area. 
Bob Green says: “ When we go na­ tional, we re going to zero in on a lot of things that threaten the American fa­ mily — like v iolence on television and children\s pornography. ’’ 
Miss Bryant agreed, adding: " I am creating a better atmosphere for our children and other children. I don’t have a cause — I am being obedient to 
God."

Wa ter, hea rt illness linked

Haae 

WASHINGTON (A P ) - A scientific report suggests that U.S. deaths from heart disease and related illnesses could be reduced by 15 per cent an­ nually through improvement of drink­ ing water. 
The reduction would be possible if water contained just the right amount of inorganic and mineral components, according to the study ordered by the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
“ In the United Stales, cardiovas­ cular diseases account for more than one-half of about two million deaths 

 that occur each year.” the report said. 
“ On the assumption that water fac­ tors are causally im plicated, it is estimated that optimal conditioning of drinking water could reduce this an­ nual cardiovascular disease mortality rate in the United States by as much as 
15 per cent.” 
That would mean 15o.ooo fewer deaths a year. 
The report was written for the E P A by the National Research Council, composed of engineers and scientists. 
The study was required by the Safe 

Drinking Water Act of 1974. The re­ sults will serve as the scientific basis for revising preliminary regulations on drinking water. 
The 18-month study is mostly tech­ nical as it reports on the 22 organic compounds found in drinking water that are known or suspected cancer- causing agents. Of the 22 compounds, only vinyl chloride is known to cause cancer in humans, the report said. 
But in a section on “ Water Hardness and Health.” the study says: 
“ A large body of scientific informa­ 

 tion indicates that certain inorganic or mineral constituents of drinking water are correlated w ith increased mor­ bidity and mortality rates.” 
Basicatly. the report said that 
“ hard" water is linked to a decreased incidence of heart disease, hyperten­ sion and strokes. 
On the other hand, “ soft" water is considered harmful because of its high levels of cadmium, lead, copper and zinc. The report offered no medical explanation for the apparent correla­ tion betwet*n water and health.

 d eposit in central Somalia in a bid to resolv e the company 's present critical problem of su pply ing its cu stomers with su fficient q u antities of nu clearpower plant fu el. 
The d eal is reported to inv olv e both the Somali gov ernment and an Eastern bloc cou ntry in an u nu su al tripartite mining consortiu m that wou ld almost certainly become the largest bu siness in this pred ominantly cattle-raising and bananagrowing 
Ind ian Ocean cou ntry , accord ing to informed Somali and Western d iplomatic sou rces. 
Howev er, a Washington report that the Sornali gov ernment has giv cm the go-ahead to Wt'stinghou se to bcigin ex ploring the ex tent of the d eposits located in Mu d u gh. 
Diplomatic sou rces here said that the ou tcome of the com plicated negotiations u nd er way now bi'tween Westinghou se and the Somali gcnernment 
{•ou lci well d epend on whether there is any signifi­ cant im prov em ent in Somali-American relations, which hav e been poor for the past eight y ears. 
In fact, the Somaili reaction to the Westinghou se proposal is now being taken here and in Washington as a test and ind ication of the fu tu re d irection of relations between the two cou ntries. 
The Carter ad ministration is making a new ov er­ tu re toward Somalia following the sharp d eteriora- ttion in the once - close ties between the United Slates land neighboring Ethiopia. The two East Airican 
« cou ntries both hav e Marx ist gov ernments bu t are isworn enemies becau se of a territorial d ispu te. u ntil reccmtly the United States was Ethiopia’s principal foreign ally and arm s su pplier, making it v irtu ally impossible for Washington to hav e good relation's at the same time with this cou ntry , whose main hig-powcr su pporter is the Sov iet Union. 
One important factor in the proposed Westingh- ou sc u raniu m v entu re, acc<» rd ing to some Western sou rces here, is the reaction of the Sov iet Union to an 
Am erican M u ltinational com pany becom ing the largest foreign priv ate inv estor in Somalia, particu ­ larly since it inv olv es a strategic mineral like u ran­ iu m.

Rho desia ns 
SALISBURY, RHODESIA (AP) - Rhod esia's white-minorily gov ernment has accepted the id ea of black majority ru le, bu t the main q u estion is how big the majority will be, a d iplomatic sou rce said 
Satu rd ay . 
A key issu e is which ad u lts will be allowed to v ote. 
Word of the gov ernment’s position came as Stev en 
Low, the U.S. am bassad or to Zambia, and Und er­ secretary John Graham of the British Foreign Office conclu d ed two d ay s of talks with lead ers here. 
Graham and Low were in Salisbu ry to lay the grou nd work for a conference to d raw u p a new constitu tion for Rhod esia allowing black m ajority ru le. 
The sou rce said it was loo early to say when the conference wou ld be held . He said the main stu m ­ bling block was whether to let all ad u lts v ote, or only those meeting certain q u alifications. 
The proposed conference is part of the latest 
Anglo-American plan to arrange a peacefu l transi­ tion to black ru le and end y ears of gu errilla war with black nationalists. 
Success 
The .sou rce said no conference wou ld be conv ened 
“ u ntil it's absolu tely certain it is going to be a su ccess.” 
He also said Prim e M inister Ian Sm ith’s gov ern­ m ent was seeking “ iron-clad ” gu arantees that whites wou ld be protected in a black-ru led Rhod esia. 
“ In practice constitu tions with su ch safegu ard s hav e been written before and hav e then been torn u p,” he said . “The key to su ch safegu ard s is to allow for an early transfer of power and then to bu ild u p confid ence” between whites and blacks. 
None of the parties wants to see a flight of white resid ents like those that occu rred in Angola and 
Mozambiqu e. 
The two env oy s planned to leav e Su nd ay for 
Johannesbu rg, Sou th A frica, and theij M apu to, 
Mozambiqu e, where they are to confer with Robert 
Mu gabe, lead er of the Zimbabwe African National 
Union. 
Guerrilla s 
ZANU is one of two gu errilla arm ies fighting to topple the Rhod esian gov ernment. Zimbabwe is the nationalist name for Rhod esia. 
The env oy s will fly on to Lu saka, Zambia, before trav eling to Lond on nex t w eekend to m ake a preliminary ’ report to their gov ernments. 
The two alread y hav e v isited lead ers in Botswana, 
Mozambiq u e, Tanzania and Zam bia, the fou r so- called frontline states backing the gu errillas.

Kidna ping s, hea v y fig hting in Ang o la 

JOHANNESBURG, 
Sou th Africa (AP) — An­ gola's M arx ist gov ern­ ment ad mitted on Satu r­ d ay that some resistance still remained following a blood y u prising by ex ­ trem e le ftists in the capita! of Lu and a. 
P resid ent A gosthino 
Neto said som e of the rebels — believ ed to be d issid ents in his ru ling 
Popu lar M ov ement for the Liberation of Angola 
(MPLA) — escaped after 
F rid ay ’s abortiv e cou p and took sev eral gov ern­ ment officials hostage. 
In Rome, the Angolan em bassy issu ed a s ta ­ tem ent say ing 
“ the stru ggle is still continu ­ ing” bu t ad d ed “the final v ictory is certain.” 
Neto, who won control of the foroer Portu gu ese colony in 1975 with the help of Sov iet arm s and 
Cu ban troops, claimed on 
F rid ay that his forces had “ totally c ru sh e d ” the u prising after street 

 battles in which m any men and women d ied . 

The Angolan lead er, in a rad io ad d ress m oni­ tored in Johannesbu rg, d id not id entify the kid ­ naped officials. Bu t a 
Portu gu ese new spaper, 
A Capital, said they were 
Finance M inister Say d i 
M ingas, F oreign M in­ istry official Garcia Neto and a secu rity man id en­ tified only as Ngazi. The new spaper said they w ere being held in a 
Lu and a su bu rb. 
No t sure 

Neto said he was “ not su re” whether “ we will find th e ir bod ies, or w hether we will find them a liv e ....” 
He promised the rebels “can ex pect no consid eration, no patd on. We hav e no 

 m ore tolerance in An­ gola. We shall proceed in a firm and tou gh m an­ ner.” 

The broad cast mad e no mention of the fate of two form er MPLA officials accu sed of instigating the rev olt. The two — former 
Interior M inister N ito 
Alv es and form er poli­ tical com m issar Jose 
Van Du nem — w ere jailed May 21 after being pu rged from the party . 

A Capital said the two were set free when the rebels stormed the prison bu t were back in cu stod y . 

In the Rome statement, the gov ernment said the u prising began when the rebels trie(l to stage a m assiv e d em onstration near the pre sid e ntia l palace on Alv es’ behalf.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) 
— Anita Josefowicz had not se^n any thing clearly for 27 y ears, and for the past two y ears she was completely blind. 
Then, in an u nu su al operation, a tiny teles­ cope-lik e dev ice was im­ planted in one ey e. 
When her doctor remov ed the bandages, the 48 -y ear-old woman y elled: “ I can see y ou r face.” 
With that, she said, 
‘‘My doctor started to cry with me. I k now he cried. 
I saw his tears.” 
“ I can’t wait to go home," she said from her hospital bed after the 
(jperation which restored sight to her right ey e. 
"I want to see flowers and trees, bu t most of all 
I want to see my grand­ son. 
He’s only two months old, and it hu rt so mu ch when I cou ldn't see my only grandchild,” she said.

“ A lot of su pport has been coming from chu rch people, ministers and the lik e,” Simonson said. 
Besides, he said. “You can’t recall a ju dge for an u npopu lar decision.” 
Bu t the ju dge's critics were angered more by his cou rtroom remark s than by the pu nishment he meted ou t Wednesday at a hearing for a 
15-y ear-old boy . The y ou th, who had not con­ tested charges of second-degreee sex u al assau lt in the rape of a 
16-y ear-old girl, was or­ dered to spend a y ear at. home u nder cou rt su per­ v ision. 

“ This commu nity is well k nown to be sex u ally permissiv e,” Simonson said in cou rt. Referring to prov ocativ e women’s clothing, he ask ed, 
“ Shou ld we pu nish sev erely a 
15-or 
16-y ear-old who reacts normally to it?” 

One y ea r 
A 14-y ear-old boy ac­ cu sed in the case was sentenced to one y ear at a grou p home in Milwau ­ k ee. A third boy was giv en immu nity from prosecu tion in ex change for testimony against the others. 

Protesters, most of them women, who were angered by Simonson’s statements marched in front of the cily -cou nly bu ilding Thu rsday , and annou nced plans for a petition to force a recall election. The clerk of 
Dane cou nty , with a 1974 popu lation of 3oo,8 oo, said they wou ld need

He su ggested that feminists spend their time work ing to prev ent rape rather than pick et­ ing his office. 
“ If y ou eliminate the tease and prov oeation. y ou may well hav e a decrease in the incidence of sex u al assau lt,” he said. 

Simonson. 52, said 
Friday that his position had been misconstru ed.

Bu t the protesters, or­ ganized by the local ehapti'r of the National

Sena te ta x bill rejected 

AUwSTlN (AP) — Heeding a complaint that the Senate’s rewrite of a lax relief bill was a jok e and an insu lt, the Hou se rejected it Satu rday and called for negotiations. 
A test v ote showed 111 representativ es wanted to send the bill to conference while 29 were ready to accept it. 
Conferees will hav e little time to reach a com­ promise, since the legislativ e session adjou rns at midnight Monday . 
The Senate left intact the Hou se’s increase in tax -ex empt inheritances from 125,ooo to $2oo,ooo, which will lose $28 million in rev enu e ov er the nex t two y ears. 
Bu t it scrapped a prov ision repealing the stale sales tax on u tility bills. Instead, they v oted to drop the sales tax only on bills showing consu mption of no more than 5oo k ilowatt hou rs of electricity or 5,2oo cu bic feet of natu ral gas a month. 
“What k ind of home wou ld u se only 5,2oo feel of gas a month?” ask ed Rep. John Wilson, D-La 
Grange. 
Very sma ll 

“It wou ld be a v ery small hou se or a lak e hou .se,“ said Rep. Joe Wy att, D-Victoria. 
He added that only a poor family wou ld u se less than 5oo k wh of electricity monthly . 
Those getting the u tility tax break wou ld only receiv e a benefit of 98 cents a month, he said, w hile the bill wou ld cu t state rev enu e by $56 million ov er the nex t two y ears.

Hugh es aide out as director 

>iEW YORK tim es s er v ice 
SAN FRA N C ISœ ~ Chfstor ( ’ Da­ vis, for many years the powerful chief counsel for flnward Miigh(‘s. has been removed as a director of Summa 
Corp., accord in}? to a statement re­ leased in Las Vcifas Saturday. 
William R. Lumnus, a cousin of the late Hughes, removed Da\1s. 
Davis, 
F.W. Gay. 5ti, who con­ tinues as a director and as pri'sidenf of 
Summa; and Nadine Hanh'v. 7(1, who also remains as a director and senior vice president, were left by flughi's to administer his e,state. 
The removal of l)a\is is of major importance in the unfolding affairs of the Hughes empire which continues to employ thousands. 
The three close associati’s were left by Hughes in charge of the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute, a rest'arch foundation to which it was assumed the reclusive industrialist would leave his fortune. Had he done so. tiu'se three would have operatf'fl his businessi's 
However, it appears fhal he never signed a will, so his relatives will in­ herit his estate. 
The leader of the relatues on ins mother’s side' is Ltimmis. 17. a Hous­ ton lawyer, who has siMwefl smee soon after Hughes’s d('af.h as the court-ap pointed administrator of the Summa 
Corp. 
Lummis dismissed Da\is as a direc­ tor but allowed him to eonfimu' as 
Summa general eounse!

My stery ev ent 

No doubt, you will be able to find an answer to the question I have. 
VVhat sort of activity at the Lady Bird Park on 
Nacogdoches Road could require all that huge battery of floodlights to be burning at 5:43 a m during a heavy thunderstorm? 
This appears to be a recurring event inasmuch us it happens quite frequently during the very early hours of the morning, come rain or whatever. 
Aside from w hat may appear to some as a horrible waste of precious energy, I don’t want to miss something important that may be going cm if it’s rtpen to the public.

H’ell, we will firet as­ sure you that you were not hallucinating. 
The lights were on, 

 confirms City Parks and 
Recreation 
Dir. 
Ron 

Darner. 

That weekend, the park 

 there was the site of a fast pitch softball tour­ nament. The tournament started at 8 a.m. Satur­ day morning. It had gone on until midnight or so the day before. 

The lights were turned 

 on early in the morning so cleaning crews could see to make the park ready for Saturday's events. 

The downpour hit at 

 about the same time, but the crews had to wait until the rain eased a bit to proceed with the 

 cleaning. 
That day’s tournament 

 the action lasted all day and ended in the wee hours of Sunday morn­ ing. 
So, the crews were out 

 there before sunrise Sun­ day morning cleaning up again. 
Darner says that when 

 you see the lights on at strange hours like that — particularly just before dawn, it is usually going to be a major clean-up that is under way. 

Fluo rescent lig hts 

Can you please clarify something for me? 
1 recently had a fluorescent bulb break in niv house and some friends of mine fold me it wae dangerous to stay inside the house when these bulbs break. 
They said there was some poisonous gas inside and that you can get sick or die fnnii a broken fluorescent lube. 
1 have never heard of such a thing. 
Can you find out the facts on this? If this is true, why don't they have some .sort ot warning printed right on the tubes. 

O. A . M . 

Well, poison gas i.s the 

 least of your worries about fluorescent lights. 
There are reports out 

 now that too much expo­ sure to fluorescent lights causes cancer. 
Those reports have not 

 been confirmed, we must stress, but thev are the subject of intensified study. 
As for the gas inside, it 

 is not deadly or even harmful. 
There is, however, 

 berrylium inside the tubs that can prevent sores from healing should it come into contact with an open wound. 
It is not a health ha­ zard, but the m etallic substance can retard healing. 
That is the only 

“ DANGER” according to 

 experts with City Public 
Service. You wiil not be­ come sick or die or an­ ything else if you acci­ dentally break a tube. 

In defense of your 

 friend, however, the 

 story about the gas inside fluorescent tubes being poisonous is one of the widely accepted old 

 wives’ tales. 

It Is like the one that 

 kids learn that if you cut a golf ball open and un- wide the rubber, there is a liquid inside that will kill you instantly. Doubt­ less, both of these stories started when a parent didn’t want their kids to break fluorescent lights because the glass shatters so much and b. ruin their good golf balls. 
Okay? 

Va lley -Hi tha nks 

Boy, do you get prompt action. 
^’ou got a complaint abcmt the whole row of str('et lights being burned out on V'alley-Hi Drive and the next day they were all fixed. 
Just a big thank you from all of us in Valley-Hi. 

R. U. V. 

 lights had been out for three weeks or so. 
We don’t know if the 

 matter had been earlier reported by residents or by the police, but we do know nothing had been done. Glad to help. 

W ell, actually. City 

Public Service had more to do with it than we did since they’re the ones who actually made the repairs. 
We merely brought it 

 to their attention that the 

 on 
Fluo ro ca rbo ns 

(’an you explain to me about the ban fluorocarbons'.’ 
First. I hear all spray cans are going to be eliminated. Then I read that HO per cent of them are going out. 
Then I heard somewhere than 3o per cent of them are already off the market. 
Now, what does this do to things like canned freon, which I understand is the same substance? 
And what is an "environmentally safe” aerosol spray that they keep advertising? 

H O USEW IFE 

The ban on fluorocar- 

 bon sprays applies only to propellants, not to freon or other forms of fluorocarbons. Even at that, about a third of the fluorocarbons used as propellants cannot be eliminated because 

 fluorocarbons provide the needed propellant for certain medicines and other essentials and sub­ stitutes are simply not satisfactory — at least yet. 
The “ environmentally 

 safe” aerosols are pro­ pelled by carbon dioxide 
—■ Co2 —■ the same stuff that makes the bubbies in your soda water. For most things, it works al- 

 most as well as fluoro­ carbons and that is what companies like Johnson 
Wax use in their furni­ ture polish and other 

 sprays. 
There is still debate 

 over the whole spray bu­ siness, but the order has been given to start get­ ting the fluorocarbons off the market. 
But, again, it applies 

 only to propellants. 
The average consumer, 

 however, will probably never notice the differ­ ence. Those items which cannot use Co2 propel- iantVill switch to hand- operated pumps — the way things were before the fluorocarbon fad hit.

AUSTIN - It took the 65th Legisla- ture less than a half-hour last Thurt its ffm p of approval on a for 19m.7lf" appropriations bill 

The bill is now on Gov. Dolph 
Briscoe’s desk where he has 2o days 
Irom the day the session ends to veto 
«ponding items in the measure 
By a unanimous 31-to-O vote the 
Senate adopted the conference com­ mittee version of the spending bill in less than two minutes. 
Thursday night, the House also con-' curred in the negotiated measure by a fb-to-59 vote after only 2o minutes of debate, 
HB 51o increases state spending for the next two years by $.3.4 billion over the 1o76-77 biennieum. 
San Antonio area schools and insti­ tutions may have fared better collecti­ vely than any other area in the state. 
Most escpaed any serious cuts between the House and Senate versions 
Hea ring set fo r 8 o n po t cha rg es 

The final pre-trial conference for eight people who are allegedly part of a marijuana importing ring is set for 
June 3o before U.S. Dist. Judge D. W 
Suttle. 
Those eight people pleaded notguilty to charges in arraignment proceedings 
Friday’. 
Fifteen people ha\ e been named by a federal grand jury in connection with operating the ring. 

 of the bill and one. the San Antonio 
State School, got a healthy increase in funding through the compromise. 
In its final form, the bill combines the school for the mentally retarded with the San Antonio State Hospital with a total two year appropriation of 
$36.4 million. 
An additional $5.4 million is now tagged for conversion of 1o ward buildings of the San Antonio Chest 
Hospital to house the new state school due to open in March 1978. 
Total general appropriations for other San Antonio schools and institu­ tions include: 
• San Antonio Chest Hospital: $1o.1 million. 
• San Antonio College: $5o.2 million. 

’ • University of Texas at San Anton­ io; $18 million. 
• 
U niversity of Texas Health 
Science Center at San Antonio: $77 2 million. 
PHONE CHARGES 
A bill approved by the House and returned to the Senate will cut into 
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.’s charges for directory assistance calls. 
SB3 prohibits Bell from charging for directory assistance or 1411 calls on long distance numbers, numbers not listed or incorrectly listed in phone books and certain businesses which cannot control them or correctly charge for them. 
The company is now charging 
2(i-cents per call for every call over 1o a montli under a rate case order issued by the Texas Public Utility 
Commission last January. 

GAS STORAGE 
The Senate concurred Thursday in 
House amendments to Sen, John 
Traeger’s bill allowing gas suppliers to use the right of eminent domain to complete underground storage units for natural gas. 
The House passed the bill Monday by an overwhelming 137-to-5 margin. 
SB8o1 is now on Bri.scoe’s desk with signing into law assured by the gover­ nor’s own promise made earlier in the 
.session. 
The bill will enable one project by 
Lo-Vaca Gathering Co. to be completed near San Antonio. 
^ 
The $65 million project will have a capacity of 19 billion cubic feet of gas 
— considered sufficient to prevent curtailment of supplies during peak demand times in San Antonio. Austin and for customers of the Lower Color­ ado River Authority. 
The gas supplier would be allowed to condemn anjihing over three quarters of the land in a site it had not been able to secure by direct negotiations. 

RIGHT-OF-HAV 
Cities and counties would save $1o million a year when the state begins paying 9o per cent of the cost of highway right-of-way. under a bill sent to the governor Wednesday. 
Right-of-way costs are currently shared 3o-5o. 

TAX INCREMENT 
A bill allowing San Antonio and 2o other cities in the state to establish special funding for urban renewal projects cleared the Senate Friday and was sent to the sovernor. 

HB2o2B by Rep. Mati Garcia of San 
Antonio, would allow the local taxing agencies to freeze taxes on’an area for a period of 2o \ oars. 
The difference between th(> frozen lax base and the higher value, as improvements are made, would be used to retire special bonds used to finance the renewal projects. 
Property owners in thi' area, Garcia says, would Ih' encouragc'd to improve their holdings as the city upgraded the area's services. 
The end result, he says, will be upgrading the area and its tax base where otherwise it would only be faced with continued decline 

TRANSIT 
,\lso Friday, the Senate passed and sent to Briscoe a measure that would allow the cities of San Antonio and 
Houston to use their rebate from state sales taxes for operation, maintenance and improvement of the city transit systems. 
GARNISHMENT 
The House refused Friday night 
67-to-54, to let Texas voters decide whether garnishment of wages for non-payment of child support should be allowed. 
The Texas Constitution prohibits garnishment of wages. 
HJR17 , by Hep. Abe Ribak of San 
.Antonio, would have put the (piestion of amending the constitution before Tex­ as voters in a 1978 referri'iiduni. 
Since Ribak’s measure involved a constitutional amendment it required a two-thirds vote of the 15o-member 
House, or 1oo. to be adopted.

(P) — Gerald Ford took time out for stmie golf at the .Myopia Hunt Club course while in town for his stin .Michael's gra ­ duation from a seminary. 
But the tangleil, rough cours(' proved loo much for the former President who shot a 9 4 — 24 strokes over par. 

Hill lo hpeak 

ARLINGTON (AP) - 
Atty, Gen. J ohn Hill will be among the speakers 
Tuesday at a eonferenee here on “ The future of the American fa mily.” 

From his spacious brick home on a gra ssy knoll in the O kla hom a City suburb of Edmond, Davis, 27 , runs an orga ni/a tion ca lled Ta x F a c ts , a growing corps of citizens opposed to the income tax and d eterm in ed to avoid paying it — legally. 
“ You can’t fight the Internal Reven­ ue Service on moral grounds and w in,” says Davis. “ But you can do it on con­ stitutional grounds and win 9 9 per cent of the time.” 
What’s that“' To document his point, 
Davis walks over to his ceiling-high btmkshelf and pulls down an armful of legal tomes, booklets and pamphlets. 
Though his profession is helping run a family grocery business, Davis’s pas­ sion is the I' S, Constitution. He recites passages from it as glibly as a grocer quoting the price of vegetables. 
Fourth Amendment 
“ B a sica lly, the IRS v iola tes our 
Fnurth .Amendment right to be secure in our persuiis, houses and papers, and our Fifth Am endm ent right to due process and a ga inst self-incrim ina - tion,” he .says. 
Davis did not pay his income tax this year and last year he “ paid only some t)f It.” But, he vows, “ I’ll never pay again.” 
Tax F a cts is a loca l orga niza tion linked in spirit with sim ila r groups cropping up in other states. They all talk of the impending “ Tax Revolt.” 
They all ca ll them selves “ Pa triots” and “ Constitutionalists.” The all claim their numbers are growing as quickly as the taxes they abhor. 
They a re b u sin essm en , la w yers, farmers, young, old, libera ls, J ohn 
Birchers. They are indignant. 
They object not only to the govern­ ment’s method of tax collection, but also to the way the money is spent. 
Foreign a id, a b ortion, socia l pro­ gra m s. subsidies, excessive govern­ ment regulations ^ all these spawn discontent. 
How to fight 
Da vis sa ys the con stitution a l a r­ gument against the income tax is sim ­ ple to understand. But know ing how to invoke it properly on one’s 1114o form is crucial. So beginning last Selem ber, he began organizing sem ina rs featur­ ing spokesmen from the tax movement to demonstrate how to fight the IRS and win. 
“ We had about 1oo people at the first sem ina r,” he reca lls. “ At the la st sem ina r, a two-da y a ffa ir in ea rly 
April, we had about 25o people from 14 states.” Participants paid $25 for two days of lectures and m eetings. 
The seminars have been so popular, 
Da vis ha s begun holding m onthly m eetings in Oklahoma City. At the first such meeting in mid May, held in a local bank’s conference room, about 
7 o people turned out to hea r Bert 
McCarty, a Fort Worth, Tex., busin­ essman who rails against the IRS with pentacosta! zea l that would hum ble most prea chers. McCarty cla im s he has not paid a cent of state or federal tax in six years. 
Like Davis, McCarty em bra ces the 
Constitution fervently, calling it “ that holy inspired docum ent.” He begins his three-hour presentation saying; “ I bring greetings from pa triots every­ where in the na m e of the C onstitu­ tion.” McCarty’s lectures are in such demand he spends w eeks at a tim e away from his ca r wash and m otel businesses exhorting and instructing tax resistance groups in the Southwest. 
Also, lik e D a vis, M cCa rty ha s compiled a manual spelling out in de­ tail how to fill out a proper 1o4o form claiming constitutional objections. It costs $15. 
‘Tea Party 19 7 6 ’ 

Several leaders of the tax movement throughout the country publish their own "how' to” booklets. Some of the more ela bora te ones — with na m es such as “ Tea Party 19 76 ” and “ Bill of 
Rights Income Tax Return Pa cket” — include everything from the Magna 
Carta to recent court decisions a ffect­ 

 ing the movement. 
According to these authors, there are three principle ways to avoid paying the income tax; invoke the Fourth and 
Fifth Am endm ents; use the “ lega l tender argument.” In that one cla im s he didn’t earn taxable income because dollars, defined by federal statute in term of gold and silver content, are no longer backed by those m eta ls. With­ out such backing, the argument goes, dollars are merely lOU’s — and lOU’s ca n ’t be ta xed a s incom e; the third method is settin g up a ta x-exem pt home church. Whichever one chooses, the m ovem ent can supply the blue­ print. 
“ Remember, we’re not rebels with­ out a ca use,” McCarty tells his atten­ tive audience. “ Our cause is this great country and our unequalled Constitu­ tion.” He adds that everyone in the room should be there because of moral convictions, not out of a greedy desire to sidestep the IRS. Of course, some pt'ople are attracted to the movement for just that reason; it can be used a s a 
•stif-righteous facade to avoid disclosing hidden incom e. But lea d ers of the m ovem ent in sist the p ercen ta ge of 
“ tax cheaters” is miniscule. 
Convictions 
“ If you don’t have those convictions, you shouldn’t be here,” McCarty tells the group. 
McCarty and Davis cla im the IRS is 
“ 9 o per cent bluff” and tha t anyone armed with knowledge of constitution­ al rights can beat it. 
“ K nowledge is pow er.” McCarty blusters, clenching his fists. “ The IRS 

They itb jeet uo l o nly to the g o veniment''s metho d o f ta x co lieetiitn b a t a I Hit to the ira y the miuiey is sp tmt 

 only goes a fter the ea sy m a rks, the people who are scared because of all the threats the IRS m a kes.” He sa ys the governm ent has left him a lone 
“ bwause they know I'm ready to go to court.” 
McCarty insists the income tax, es­ tablished in 19 13 with pa ssa ge of the 
16 th Amendment to the Constitution, is on shaky ground, and the IRS knows it. 
Easy marks 
The num ber of “ ea sy m a rk s” is d ecrea sin g d a ily, a ccord in g to m ovem ent lea ders. T hey cite pub­ lished reports, attributed to IRS , that an estimated 5 m illion to 1o m illion 
Americans don’t file tax returns; J ack 
Anderson said in a column la st year that the tax resista nce m ovem ent is gaining 2,ooo members a day. 
Davis points to a remark two years ago by then-Treasury Secreta ry W il­ liam Simon, who sa id, “ The rate of compliance has begun lo drop...We are fa ced with an in cip ien t ta xp a yers revolt.” 

But IRS disputes cla im s that resis­ tance is swelling, saying that if anyth­ ing, tax com plia nce na tionw ide a p­ pears to be improving. 

According to government sta tistics, in 19 55 the IRS received one tax return for every 2.8 Americans; by 19 75 that ratio was one return per 2,5, But those figures could be a ffected by fa ctors other than the compliance rate, such as the percentage of Americans in the labor force. 

In Oklahoma, the acting director of the IRS office, Mike Kelly, declined to d iscu ss loca l ta x p rotester s. “ He doesn’t like to make any com m ents on it,” a public relations spokesman said. 
Tax protesters say IRS refuses to talk about the movement for fear pub­ licity will fuel the fires of resista nce. 

Kelly did offer a written statement, however, saying; “ The number of pro­ testors in Oklahoma is rela tively m i­ nor...we are concerned that people who follow the protestors’ instructions are opening th em selv es to p ossib le criminal prosecutions.”

SF tC IA l TO TH£ EXRBESS N EW S 
WASHINGTON - Here is how area members of 
Congress voted on key roll calls for the week ending May 27: 
HOUSE 
AUTO POLLUTION 
In a major \1ctory for the auto industry, the 
House voted 255-139 to delay some auto exhaust standards for two years and to cancel others. The vote came on an amend­ ment to the Clean Air Act of 197o. 
Supporters of easing the pollution standards argued the delay was ne­ cessary because the auto industry could not meet the existing standards for 
1978 model ears. 
Opponents of delaying the pollution standards said the auto industry could have already met the tougher standards if they really wanted to. 
Voting to delay auto standards: Gonzalez (D), 
Kazen (D), Krueger (D). 
AFRICAN AID 
By a 2o4-2o8 vote, the 
House refused to shelve a proposed $1oo-million 
African special require­ ments fund to aid African statt's affected by the ci­ vil strife in Rhodesia. 
Members seeking to eliminate the special aid to Africa Oom a foreign aid hill argued the fund would involve the United 
States in a foreign con­ flict. undermine efforts to resolve the Rhodesian crisis peacefully and as­ sist Mozambique and other 
M arxist governments. 
Members against shelving the special aid said the fund would simply provide financial assistance to those Afri­ can states whose rail lines and other economic channels have been dis­ rupted by the conflict in 
Rhodesia 
Voting against African aid fund: Gonzalez (D). 
Kazen (D). 
Voting no to eliminate fund: Krueger (D). 
SENATE 
FOOD STAMPS 
By a 31-84 vote, the 
Senate voted to make food stamps free. The vote was against an amendment to restore the provision in current law which requires food 

 stamp recipients to pay cash for a portion of their coupon allotment. 
Proponents of free food stamps argued that the 
“ poorest of the poor” could not participate in the program because they are unable to get together th" cash necessary to buy food stamps. Also, they said, doing away with cash transactions would eli­ minate a lot of the fraud in the program. 
Opponents argued free food stamps would greatly increase the cost of the program and would change food stamps from a nutrition program to a welfare giveway because reci­ pients would no longer have to spend a certain amount of their income on food. 
Voting to retain charges for food stamps: 
Tower (R). 
Voting not to retain charges: Bentsen (I)). 
WHEAT PRICE 
SUPPORTS 
By a 48-6o vote, the 
Senate rejected a farm bill amendment that wduld have cut the sup­ port price for the 1977 wheat crop to $2.85 a bu­ shel, instead of $2.9o. 
Supporters of cutting the wheat support price said the administration opposed the top price as being too expensive and 
President Carter would veto the entire farm bill because of it. In addition, they claimed the $2.9o level would bust the con­ gressional budget, be­ cause it would raise the agriculture part of the budget far above the levels already approved by Congress. 
Opponents of cutting the wheat support price said U.S. wheat farmers are in serious financial trouble because huge surplus has caused w heal prices to plummet with­ out a higher support price. They warned many wheat farmers will go bankrupt. They argued it is more important to keep American agricul­ ture healthy and that budgets could always be adjusted later. 
Voting not to reduce supports: Bentsen (D ), 
Tower (R).

AGENCE ERANCE-PRESSE 
PEKIN G — China has formally warned Japan not to ratify a treaty with South Korea for the Joint development of the resources on the continental shelf between the two countries. 
The warning was delivered on Friday afternoon in 
Peking to Japanese Ambassador Heishiro Ogawa by 
Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs lío Ying. 
Japan would bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from ratification of the treaty, the Chinese warning stated. 
The text of the Chinese warning was published 
Friday night by the New China News Agency, and diplomats in Peking noted it was couched in stronger terms than previous Chinese statements on the Japanese-Korean treaty. 
Peking has demanded that any decision on the future of the zone must be tripartite. Japan does not agree with this interpretation.

Tex a s ho lida y wea ther perfect 

For a Memorial Day weekend, Saturday’s weather across Texas was almost perfect for outdoor holiday activities. 
The sun blazed down through clear to partly cloudy skies over most of the state causing temper­ atures to approach summer-like readings. 
Clouds covered skies in parts of South Texas while morning haze reduced visibility in extreme East 
Texas. By early afternoon, the haze had been re­ placed with partly cloudy skies. 
Temperatures reached into the upper 8os and low 
9os in many cities with Dallas and Midland reporting readings of 93 degrees. San Antonio and Del Rio had readings at the same time of 76 degrees under cloudy skies. 
Southerly winds between 1o and 15 miles an hour., sifted through the eastern two-thirds of Texas while westerly breezes caressed the remainder of the state.

Energ y pla n pro m o tio n ca lled tepid 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — The cha irma n o f the 
Ho use co mmittee with prima ry co ntro l o v er the fa te o f President Ca rter’s energ y pro ­ g ra m sa y s the a dministra tio n ha s been 
“ tepid” in its effo rts to ex pla in the pro po ­ sa ls to Co ng ress. 

“ The White House has not made as compelling a case for the plan as it might have,’’ 
Rep. 
Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio, said in an interview. 
“ There hasn’t been a very lucid description of the kind of dislocations — economic, social and political — that are cer­ tain to befall us if we continue our random ap­ proach to the energy problem,” he said, 
Ashley, an 
11-term congressman, chairs the 
House Ad Hoc Energy 
Committee, created by the House to consider 
Carter’s energy pro­ gram. 
Ex pla na tio ns 

He said administration officials have not only failed to explain the domestic dangers of in­ action, but have also ig­ nored the need to spell out the foreign policy implications of allowing the United States to be­ come increasingly de­ pendent on foreign oil. 
Ashley was particular­ ly critical of Charles L. 
Schultze, chairman of the 
White House Council of 
Economic Advisers; Burt 
Lance, director of the 
Office of Management and Budget; and Trea­ sury Secretary W. M i­ chael Blumentha 1, for failing to provide projec­ tions of likely inflation, unemployment and econ­ omic growth rates if no energy plan were enact­ ed. 
“ I think they have done a tepid job,” Ashley said of administration efforts to explain the need for the energy program. 

W ill return 
In the long run, Ashley said if the tough-to-swai- low portions of the en­ ergy plan fail to get through the Congress this year, persistent predic­ tions of shortages will bring them back again and again in subsequent legislative sessions. 
The 1977 Carter energy plan “ isn't an all or nothing proposition,” 
Ashley said. “ But one day we are going to do it.” 
Ashley said Congress will likely make major revisions to the proposed energy package, which 

REP. TH O M AS ASHLEY 

 now includes a standby gasoline tax, a tax on cars with low gasoline mileage and a rebate for buyers of cars which get high gasoline mileage. 
“ The strategies of the 
White House are not sacrosanct,” said Ash­ ley, who is frequently blunt and caustic in pub­ lic statements on various issues. 
Ashley said while 
White House energy ad­ viser 
Jam es 
R. 
Sehlesinger has been in­ sistent that the final en­ ergy plan meet conser­ vation goals set for 1985, the Carter adm inistra­ tion is willing to com­ promise. 

Cha ng es 
“ l have sensed that the 
White House and Sehle­ singer are willing to see changes made in strategies... They are not being obdurate.” 
Some House members have suggested gasoline rationing as an alterna­ tive to the gasoline and gas guzzler taxes. 
“ 1 think we would be reluctant to go the ra ­ tioning route,” Ashley said. “ There is prefer­ ence for the free market system.” 
While Ashley’s com­ mittee has been holding hearings on the energy package, other House panels with jurisdiction over specific parts have been making their own critical examination. 
House Speaker Thomas 
P. O’Neill has set a July 
12 deadline for subordin­ ate committees to com­ plete work and report to 
Ashley’s panel. 
Well-known writer 
Bruce Bliven dies 

STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Bruce Bliven, well- known author and former editor of the New Repub­ lic, is dead at 88. 
He had been hospitalized for three weeks at 
Stanford Medical Center, suffering from bones bro­ ken in a fall at his home on the Stanford University campus. He died there Friday night. 
Bliven, a major contributor to magazines and author of numerous books, was perhaps best known for his annual Christmas letters to 5oo friends, full of his wry comments on the current scene and jokes about old age. 
His articles appeared in the Saturday Evening 
Post, Ladies’ Home Jou rnal, Readers Digest, 
Harper’s, Redbook and others. 
Among his books were “ The Men Who Made the 
Future,” “ Preview for Tomorrow,” “ The Unfin­ ished Business of Science,” “ The World Changers” and a 197o biography, "Five Million Words Later.”

New York, she was offered a joh in 111«' garment district, which he aeeei)led. 
“ I sweated blood to get tny 
Green Card, but with it I can work and come and go us I please. 1 retained my South 
African eiti/enship. but I am considered a permanent resi­ dent of New York,” 
In her [losition us salesperson for children’s clothes in a wholesale showroom, Gail met 
Mrs. Hoberl Stephens, a buyer and manager of Courtney. Seott and I'riends. 
Mrs. Stephens in\ited the personable yomig miss to San

This idea had to he given up when she discovered that with­ out a permit requiring a four to six-week wait. South African passports are not allowed to enter Mexico, Instead, Gail left for California to visit friends she had met in San Diego, Los 
.Angeles and San Francisco. 
Hawaii is also on (ia il’s itin­ erary before returning to .lo- hannesburg in St'ptembcr. She is still m ur\cling at how friendly Americans have Itt'cn lo her. The majoi ily of her contd<-ts have been friends of friends. 
However, in 
Beverly 
Hills she met a travel agent who had t'lijoyed a trip lo so South .Africa so nuieh he gave her a “ no strings” five-day trip to Las 

Vegas. “ That’s the way every­ thing worked. I ’d be in one town with no plans, and a week later. I ’d wake up in another town” 

Now that Gail has seen the 
United States, she’s not sure she will be happy returning to the home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Turner, and resum ing her position as a children’s wear buyer. Turner is a Datsun car dealer and Mrs. 
Turner is .Mayoress of Honey

Summer Sunset.” Both male and female models will show how' to utilize and coordinate your summer clothes with the first fashions of fall. 

Honorees will be the staff of Frost 
National Bank. And highlighting the evening will be the feature models-of- the-month — Laurie Benedict. Tom 
Karam and John Stover of Frost Bank. 

C o m m e n ta to r 

KTSA’s Bruee Hathaway will share the podium with Joske's fashion com­ mentator Jacqui Zock who predicts an evening of “ fun, food and fashion.” 
Doors of the third floor restaurant will open at 6:3o p.m. with a cash wine 

 fashi on 

 bar. Dinner will be served at 7, and the show will begin at 7:3(1 p.m. 
Tickets must be purchased in ad­ vance at Joske's North Star Ticket 
Service (Ext. :1o7). Deadline for pur­ chase is Saturday. June 4. Cash orders must be picked up by that date, and charge orders will be held at the door. 

Says New Yorker Ellie Grossman in a story for the Express-News: 
“ For 2o of his 37 years, George 
Masters was almost consumed by 
Jennifer Jones, Marilyn Monroe and a stable of other Hollywood beauties who made a liv ing and a lifetime out of an obsession with their looks. 
“ No one but George, they swore, could focus such pretty blue eyes on them and say. ‘With this hairstyle and such and such makeup, I can make you a knockout!’ 
“ Then he did it, spectacularly. He still does. 
“ They paid dearly for his talent, and often they gave him little gifts: houses, boats, motorbikes. 
“ He, in turn, was steadfast. During all those years, he never once betrayed their confidences, their weaknesses to Louolla or Hedda. 
“ What he did. it seems, was save it all for his book, ‘The Masters Way to 
Beauty.” ’ 
And, adds Ellie, the book “ is obese with gossip.” Wait until you read his observations on Rita Hayworth and 
Doris Day, 
Start 
“ Amazingly, the Masters’ touch must have been there bum the start,” she says. “ Twelve year-old 
George left his mother and two older sisters in Detroit and found his way into a chic salon in Grosse Pointe, 
Mich, as a shampoo boy — there to work fearlessly on women like (the then) Mrs. Henry Ford. 
“ At 13, through Anne Ford, he became Elizabeth Arden’s favorite apprentice In New York; at 17, he was heading Sak s beauty salon in Beverly 
Hills — and (lie whirl began.” 
Says Masters: “ I loved it then, but I wouldn’t do it again I was getting ulcers from ‘HO to ‘65 running from one star lo another.” 
In recent years, Masters has tra­ velled through the country explaining lus beauty basics to thousands of women who flock to see him for 
2o-minute consultations for which lie charges $15o. 
Line up, gals. This time you can see him for free! — Mildred Whiteaker 

The ma ster ma keup a rtist — 
Geo rg e Ma sters — is co ming to to wn, 

Sure, you’ve heard of him Almost everybody has by now. He hit the 
Texas scene full force when he turned 
Lynda Bird Johnson (now Mrs. 
Charles Robb) into a full-fledged glamor girl for a Hollywood Oscar night. 
Remember? Of course, you do. l ie ’s on a first-name or nickname basis with more stars of stage, screen, television — not to mention the social and financial scene— than any other makeup artist in the world. 
Knows more secrets, too. 
That's why George is cominc to town — to share the secrets of “ the 
Masters touch.” He’ll be in Joske’s 
North Star Mall Restaurant at 7:3o 

 p.m. Friday to chat about his exper­ iences. answer questions from the audience (you'd better get there ear­ ly!) and autograph copies of his new l>ook “ The Masters Way to Beauty.” 
Complimentary tickets are availa­ ble in the 
Book 
Department of 
Joske’s North Star. The evening will include refreshments and a minia­ ture fashion show. 
If you miss him Friday, don’t fret. 
You'll have a chance to ask the arti­ culate artist your questions about 
Marilyn Monroe, Ann-Murgaret. Liza 
Mineili, or whoever on Saturday, 
He'll be in the Book Department of 
Joske’s Downtown from 11 a.m. until noon; Windsor Park from 1:3o to 2:3o and North Star from 3:3o to 4:3o. 
You might have a chance to ask a question about your own beauty problems But bo prepared for a can­ did answer. That’s the Masters' re­ putation!

There’s nothing worse than getting on a plane bedraggled and exhausted. a rat ion 

 cities you visit. 
Try a facial, a massage or a make-up lesson so that you can bring home some new tricks. Take careful note of trends in eye make-up or hair styling. Latch on to the look you like the best and try it out on yourself. 
Long plane flights can be tiresome, so wear loose and comfortable clothes. 
Keep make-up light and apply extra moisturizer to your face during the flight. 

Last, but possibly most important of all, be sure and buy the most flattering sunglasses you can find and take scarves to wrap up a wilted hairdo. It’s a chic disguise for the times you are too busy having fun to bother with the rest.

 j e n n y M ARTINEZ finds right book assisted by Sister 
Concepcion Garcia 
PHOTOS BY RON JONES 

Ev en the legendary warm hos­ pitality of Alamo town some­ times fa ils to penetrate the lone­ liness and occasional fear ex ­ perienced by y ou ng women new to o ur Riv er city . 
Bu t Sister Maria Lu isa Cin'neta rev eals. “This is a situ ation as old as time and will continu e. Not only in 
San Antonio, bu t in all corners of the world.” 
A centu ry ago in Madrid, Spain. Vi- centa Maria Lopez Y Vicu na saw many y ou ng v illage girls coming into the city atmosphere with no place to go. 
She organized Dau ghters of Mary 
Immacu late Order of Catholic Sisters whose liv es were dedicated to helping the y ou ng girls while they look ed for domestic work . 
Almost 1oo y ears later, she was can­ onized in 1975 for her dedication and work in fou nding the congregation and filling a v ital hu man need. 
Vatican II changed the name to Re­ ligiou s Mary Immacu late Order and the m etam orphosis of civ ilization changed the reason for girls coming to the big cities — bu t the job of the Sis­ ters remains basically the same. 
Ha v en 
San Antonio has it’s own hav en. Villa 
Maria, bu ilt in 195 4. and now located at 
Au gu sta and McCu llou gh. The original home was on Sou th Flores. 
The laree. air-conditioned, modern, light brick dormitory sty led residence for girls is ru n by the Order. You ng stu dents or work ing girls of any creed with good moral standing are welcome. 
Sister Maria Lu isa, Mother Su perior at Villa Maria, say s. “ Parents of y ou ng girls often decide to let their dau ghters come to San Antonio, only after talk ing to u s here.” 
Girls from 16 to 26 are accepted. 
Ijength of their stay depends on their reason for coming. Girls in training or college stay for months while work ing girls sometimes stay sev eral y ears. 
Sister Mary Garcia, cou nselor who recently work ed in New York City , say s, “ If those girls saw this modern and comfortable home with its gener­ ou s facilities, they wou ld be shock ed. 
They pay more for less.” 

Becau se the cook ing, cleaning, cleri­ cal work , cou nseling and other work is done by the Order, rent is cheap. Girls pay $1oo per month for priv ate rooms and $8 o for dou bles. Two meals daily and three on Su nday are inclu ded. 
A well-eq u ipptHi lau ndry offers the girls a safe, handy place to tak e care of this continu ing chore. 
Lifesty le 
One of the three floors has priv ate rooms with sem i-priv ate baths for those who prefer a q u ieter lifesty le. 
Others are planned for those who lik e the sharing, lau ghter and togetherness of dorm-sty le liv ing. 
Sister Maria Lu isa say s, “We can accommodate abou t 1oo girls and right now we hav e only 6o. We wou ld lik e to feel that people k now we are here — especially those who need u s.” 
F’ou r y ears ago, the Sisters changed to the shorter, less traditional habits. 
Ou tside their small chapel stands a statu e in the habit of y esterday . Bu t the joy of serv ing others is the same on her face as the smiling faces of the resident 
Sisters. 
Each floor has a small office where a 
Sister is on call for any girl who has a problem or needs a friend. 
Cu rfews are maintained bu t are not ex treme. Midnight is work or school day bedtime and I a.m. is maintained for week ends. 
Besides an efficient cafeteria sty led k itchen and bright cheery dining hall, the girls hav e a small k itchen for priv ate snack ing. A small stov e and a refrigerator hold su pplies for occasions when they can’t schedu le meals at regu lar times. 
Tra v el 
With their downtown fringe location, the girls hav e q u ick access to bu siness and cu ltu ral centers. For those who hav e cars, there is park ing space. 

Bu t if a girl arriv es by bu s at night anti doesn’t k now her way arou nd, a call to Villa Maria will bring a member of her “new family " in a car to tak e her home. 
And if there's no way for her to go apply for a job or chwk on her college cou rses, a chau ffeu r in short black habit will help her get the situ ation u nder control. 
Many of the residents are Mex ican- 
Americans from the Valley and other art‘as in Tex as and many are of the 
Catholic faith. Bu t adding the spice of v ariety are girls of all nationalities and different faiths. 
One y ou ng resident completed her nu rsing traininji while at Villa Maria and IS n(» w practicing her profession. A pt'tite girl from India with dark ey es and long dark hair, she say s. “ It’s been great being able to stay here I lov e it.” 

Hmtms are personali/ed by the girl? with {posters, slwfftHi animals. re<*ord play ers, ex tra pillows and other bright d(H*orations 
They an' pleased to ha\e su ch economical lodging with secu rity as an addl'd plu s. 
Spanish, English, sewing and cook ing lessons are giv en by the Sisters to those who are interested. 
Each girl has her own lock wl mail­ box . There is a sew ing rormi. ctinfer­ ence room, lou nge, telev ision n« » m and library . 
“ No girl is tu rned away if she can't pay ." Sister Maria Lou isa say s, “We tak e her in and help her lH*conie self- su pporting.” 
Yards of glass let in San Antonio su nshine to add to the warm glow the girls hav e already fou nd at Villa Maria 
—• "their home away from home.”

NOT AUL FABRICS AT ALL STORES 

Last week we pu shed ou r carts together inside a large discou nt depart­ ment store. I noted that two brands of paper napk ins were on sale at a terrific price! 
One was a fam iliar q u ality brand - - - the k ind that clings to y ou r lap, not y ou r hands. I reached for a pack age. 
“ Hey .” Nancy called from the other side of the display . 
“ These are cheaper! Look , there’s 3o m ore napk ins in each pack age.” 
“ Hav e y ou tried them?” I ask ed. I was hesitant to bu y an u nk ­ nown brand. 
“ They ’re fine,” she said confidently . “ A nap­ k in’s a napk in! They ’re fine.” 
1 believ ed her, followed her ex am ple and re ­ placed my first choice with the bigger bargain brand. 
Discovery 
Later that day I disco­ v ered 1 had pu rchased 28 o paper napk ins which wou ld m ak e great no- tepaper bu t were of no v alu e whatsoev er, at the dinner table. The first time, I u sed one, I cu t my lip! 
Nancy does this to me all the time! And ev ery - time she does it, I v ow to nev er go shopping with her again. 
She once persu aded me to bu y fiv e pack ages of school binder paper on* sale. Later we learned the lines were printed on the clear plastic wrapper on­ ly - - - not on the sheets of paper! 
On one trip, Nancy in­ sisted we share a large bag of potting soil be­ cau se it was cheaper to bu y in q u antity . 1 spent 
$3.98 for a plastic container in which to store my half of the 1oo pou nds of dirt! 
“ These napk ins are terrible!” I complained to Nancy y esterday as 1 peeled paper from my finger tips and sweet roll. 
“You said y ou had u sed them before." 
“No. I didn’t.” Nancy insisted. “ All I said was, 
‘A napk in’s a napk in' and that they were fine.’* 
“Well,” I complained. 
“ These napk ins aren’t napk ins at all. And they are NOT fine • - • they ’re worse than newsprint. 
“I ju st hope,” 1 went on, “that y ou ’v e learned a lesson abou t bu y ing strange brands, now that y ou ’v e u sed them at y ou r dinner table.” 
“Oh, I didn’t bu y them for the dinner table,” she said. “ I bou ght them for the bottom of the bird cage. They ’re ju st the 

 right size— they ’re fine!” 
“ H eav ens!” she con­ tinu ed. “ 1 only bu y one brand for the dinner table 
- - - y ou k now, the k ind that clings to y ou r lap, not to y ou r fingers.” 
I will nev er go shop­ ping with Nancy again . .

Labo rato ry ’s president 
Bill Baker, New Yo rk eco no mist Leo Cherne —- were nev er paid fo r their wo rk, o nly $35 per diem during each three-day meeting. 
It’s Carter’s “ co lo ssal mistake,” said Luce, the o nly wo man member. 
“ He has abo lished the o nly intelligence o v er­ sight co mmittee that was fo r him. He has go ne and 

 go tten rid o f men o f tre­ mendo us ex perience in the field o f intelligence and defense who co uld hav e trained their re­ placements. 
“ And it was pe.anuts o r peanut seeds as far as ex penses went — o ne bo ard ro o m, a little lo bby and a file ro o m in the 
EOB,” said Mrs. L. 

Decision 

The decisio n to kill o r keep the super-brainy gro up must hav e been left up to new CIA direc­ to r Stansfieid Turner. 
The night o f King Hus­ sein’s dinner here. Ha­ milto n Jo rdan was asked if the President planned to keep PFIAB and he replied, “ I do n’t kno w. 
Ask Mrs. Turner. “ 
The latter, who was sitting nex t to him, smilingly answered that her husband hadn’t de­ cided y et. Within 1o day s newspapers said it was abo lished. Co mplained or.w- member who wanted his name o mitted, “ It was a v ery graceless way to discharge so me great peo ple — a fo rm, ma­ chine-ty ped letter sent o ut after they heard fro m the press that they were disbanded.” 
Go rdo n Grey thinks it was the hard questio ns the bo ard asked o f fo r­ eign intelligence-gather­ ing agencies, including the CIA. that bro ught abo ut its demise. 
Nelso n Ro ckefeller is sad abo ut it. He had to resign fro m the bo ard when he became Vice 
President but he to ld 
Jimmy Carter reinstate­ ment to PFIAB was the o ne jo b he wanted. 
Intelligence is appar­ ently beco ming a bigger pro blem these day s than stupidity .

DEAR WANTS; 
A te e n - a g e r's 
“ eru sh” o r “ pu ppy lo v e” is as r« *al us matu re lo v e is to an adu lt. 
Teen-agers su ffer the same lo ngu igs,

DEAR ABBY: 
E v e ry y e a r my dau ghter and her children hav e v isited 
IIS and stay ed all su m m er, and each y ear the children gro w a little bo lder. 
Last su m m er my ho me was bedlam! 
The children kept the stereo go ing fu ll-biasl night and day . refu sed to pick 
U[) after themselv es, ate all day lo ng and abu sed o u r lo v ely fu rnitu re. They partied at night and left the m ess fo r me to clean u p in the mo rning. 
They had their teen-age friends ru n­ ning in ami o ut and nev er bo thered to intro du ce o ne o f them to their g rand­ father o r me. 
T h e ir m o th e r said te e n -a g e rs 
NEVER intro du ce their friends to an- v u ne. mil ev en to their parents. I was sho cked to hear the ru de m anner in which tho se children talked back to their m o ther, and she d id n ’t say a wo rd.

DEAR GRAM: No adv ice, ju st sy m- patliy . If y o u pu t u p with tho se ho o li- 

 gans ano ther su m m er, y o u ’v e asked fo r it. 
Apparently v o u failed to teach y o u r dau ghter what y o u r mo ther tau ght y o u: 
Respect fo r o ne's elders. Fo r if y o u had, she’d hav e passed it o n to HER children. .And perhaps so mething else wo u ld hav e been passed o n; the willo w switch. 
DEAR ABBY: 1 am writing in rcfer- ciH-c to a letter fro m D.AZED, who ridicu led her friend fo r spending so mu ch mo ney o n her d o g ’s fu neral.

Yes, Chiehi was my “ child.” .Actu al­ ly , she was mo re lo v ing than a hu man 

 child. She lo v ed me and asked fo r no thing in retu rn bu t my lo v e. 
1 kno w many children who do n’t g i\e their parents lo v e, bu t ex pect their parents to giv e them ev ery thing in creatio n.

Selling of Spurs no game for backers 

ART SCHULTZ shows off his block gold mine 

By RICHARD ERICKSON 
EXPRESS-NEWS BUSINESS EDITOR 
To the dedicated fan, the real excitement of a Spurs basketball game is the fast break and the quick dunk. 
But to the management of the 
Spurs, the real excitement is a packed house of fans, each one armed with a hot dog, a soft drink and a program. 
Tho game of pro basketball in San 
Antonio is definitely not a game, ac- eording to John H. Lapham 11, Spurs advertising director. It is first and last a Inisiness. 
And when the last point of the season 
IS scored by the players, that is the time the business side starts its own 
“ fast break.’“ 
Season tickets 

“ We start aiming immediately at renewals of program advertising and season tickets,” Lapham said. 
The response has been exci'llent. he added, especially since the Spurs en­ tered the National Basketball Assn. 
(N BA). Renewals for si'ason tickets are running more than HU per cent while advertising renewals are more 

^It is a multi-million dollar operation^ and a lot o f people donH realize that when they buy a ticket, 
’ 

 than 78 pi'r cent, he said. 
“ When we were in the American 
Basketball Assn., (AB.\) we had about 
28 to 3tl ad\i'rtisers,” Lapham said, 
“ but WE* doubleil it when we entered the NBA.” 
There are several important reasons for that increase, he maintains. Some are financial but some are city loyalty, 
“ U was not particularly because of the sales ability of my staff but be- i*ause it is new and the only major sport in town,” he said. 

“ Also, advertising in the Spurs pro­ gram or courtside newspaper has con­ notations of supporting San Antonio because, being the only professional team in town, tin* team represents tin*

^Awlman^ hits big gusher 

And you thought the Arab na­ tions had the corner on oil? Meet 
Art Schultz, Texas oil baron . . , sort of. 
Schultz is actually only a part-time oil baron and on a very small scale at that. For a mere $5, he will quickly sell you eight ounces of the fint*st crude oil 
Texas can produce, suitable for place­ ment on your coffee table or delivery to your doubting uncle in Iowa. e. 
And, to the surprise of not a single pet rock owner, in the three weeks it iias been on sale, stores throughout Iht* state can’t keep the little plastic bar­ rels of the stuff in stock. 
San Antonio oil fans get their chance this week as “ your own personal barrel of oil from the Genuine Texas (’rude 
Oil Co. Inc.” goes on sale all over town 
—including the Alamo gift shop, lo­ cated right next to the cradle of Texas liberty. 
“ This is really a case of American free enterprise the smiling, fast-talk­ ing Schultz gushes. 
“ When 1 cam up with this no one, not a bank, not one investor would touch it, so I took my life savings of 
S25,ooo and used that. 
“ And my wife had a fit.” he chuckk*s now. 
Three weeks on the market and 
Schultz has recouped his original investment from the souvenir. Fver- ything from now on is literally black gold for the man from Richardson. 
Earthy gifts 

Schultz has real roots for his idea of the earthy gifts. He is a salesman for a 
Georgia textile firm selling material for casket linings. 
But selling only takes up six months of his time. He says. “ Being semi-re­ tired is not that good becau.se all 1 do is spend money.” 
The trick was to find a way to make money instead, he said. 

■Ju J 

¥il ■ u rn 
RUDE 

The idea for Texas Crude had a ser­ ious beginning. Schultz believes in Jtl years oil will be gone, replaced by synthetics and other sources of energy. 
And so peo|)le who don’t buy it now won’t have any idea what it looks like in the future, he said. . 
As down-to-earth as those visionary principles might have been originally, the genuine, registered stock certifi­ cate (transferable only in the city of 

Far (Jut, Tex.) and the little, thumb- 
[irinted Oilman’s (pronounced “ awl- man’s“ Handbook give one a ft*w doubts on how those principles ended up on the profit and loss statement. 
The handbook, particularly, is in­ structive to the new oil baron. It con­ tains such instructions as how to walk now that you are in oil (thumbs in britches, hands hanging and it helps if 
>ou have a beer-belly to rest your hands on). 
Or such handy tidbits as how to play cards (poker, of course, and with a disarming innocence, calling yourself a simple country boy a few times for effect). 
But most instructive is how' to use vour real Van Zandt (’ounty oil once it is properly refined. It w ill, for in­ stance, make enough gas to drive your 
Cadillac for 3o seconds or kt*ep your 
Lear Jet rllnning for a tenth of a se­ cond. 
Not frivolous 
But, keep in mind, all this is not frivolous. Real Texas oil executives arc buying these things, Schultz says, to send to their investors as samples of what they are investing in. 
Gulf and Mobil are interested in the idea, Schultz notes, adding the staffs of both Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin have been in touch with him on possi­ ble apiiearanci's on their shows. 
Waco native Hughes Rudd already had his say on the whole thing on the 
CBS Morning News a few weeks back. 
Rudd compared it to the selling of 
Texas horned toads as baby din/isaurs at the Chicago W orld’s Fair in the 
193os. 
Rudd, true Texan to the end, said 
Schultz had entered into the “ great 
Texas tradition of making a few dol­ lars off of ignoramuses from the rest of the country.” 
But isn’t the fledgling Texas tycoon afraid his product itself will add to the energy shortage? 
No, he answers with that F.T. Bar- 

 iium grin, bt'cause if every housiJiold in the country had a barrel of his Texas 
Crude, it would only be 125.ooo (real) barrels. 
A mere drop in the bucket. He ex­ pects to sell over a half-million of tin* tiny barrels by (’hristmas. 
Ah, but isn't Art Schultz the sly one, though. W hile you are mumbling thoughts of “ Why didn’t 1 think of that?” he is still holding his job of selling coffin-lining material. 
“ And why not?” he responds. “ 
Texas Crude might make a lot of money but someday the well ha.s to run dry.” 

 city on road trips and the like,” he added. 
Lapham does not go after one typt* of advertising for the Spurs in his search to fill ad space in the program and time on radio and television broad­ casts. 
“ We are aiming at a specific au­ dience only in that it s a sports-or- iented publication. But as far as ad­ vertisers, we cover tlu* whole city." hi* said. 
,\nd those advertisers — from Alamo 
Athletics to Cniroyal-Kcds. but also including banks and hair stylists — have a chance to attract the attention of as many as 4oo,oo1) people with up to 
1o.ooo programs and courtside nt'wspapers per game for 41 games. 
“ It ’s really the cheapest buy in town,” Lapham explained. A (iuarter- page ad sells for $4oo for 41 home games, he said. 
Another major source of inconu* — the one that keeps the business afloat, according to Lapham — is the conces­ sions; Hot dogs. b{*er, souvenirs and all tlu* rest the public considers extra and possibly non-essential to (he game 
Concessions Inc. 

It is nut by at*cident, he savs that the group of more than 5o investors which own the Sjnirs is nanu'd ('oncessions 
Inc. 
In fact, he believes one of the main reasons tlu* latest other professional sports team in San Antonio, the 
Thunder soccer team. faiU*d was be­ ta usi* it did not own the concessions at its ganu's. 
The Thunder has mov(*d to Hawaii where, reports indicate, attendence figures for the group are even lower than they were in San Antonio. 
Lapham, while declining to revt*ul specific money figures, said the Spurs are big business. 
“ It is a multi-million dollar opera­ tion and a lot of people don’t realize that when they buy a ticket,” he said.

And is it a profitable business? 
Again, Lapham would not discuss specific amounts but said, “ No. it is not profitable for most investors. 'I’he team maki*s operating expenses but it is principally usi*d as a tax shelter. 
High cash flow 

“ Doctors, lawyers an* flu* iirnicijial investors and with (lie high cash flow of (h(*ir professions, this is a logical slu‘lt«*r to get into,” hi* said.

Investors don’t just wait for the stat(‘ments to arrive, according to the advertising man. Most are involved in selling season tickets to friends and business associates. 
“ J ’he people come to se»* the players and rightly so, because that is what the game is associated with, and all the 
Spurs give a lot to the ball club,” La­ pham said. 
“ But It is the advertising and the concessions that eventually pay tlu*ir 
.salaries and," he said, a good season makes everybody’s job easier. ” 

S.A., over 
CAB tied in war air route cases 
In the never-eiiiling battle to improve air service to San An­ tonio, the most recent score is 
Alamo City 1, Civil Aeronautics 
Board (CAB) 1. 
Since the first of the year, San An­ tonio has quietly entered two new route eases, both originated in other cities, aeeording to Tom Rafferty, director of the city’s Department of Aviation. 
The first was a reijuest by Las Ve­ gas, Nev., to extend service from that city to “ various points in South Tex­ as.” San Antonio was spt'eifieally mentioned, as was Houston. FI Paso. 
Dallas and t'orpus I ’hristi, 
First step 
'I'he rt‘tpjest to the (.'.\B —- whieli can only be initiatetl from an airport city, an airline or the board itself~ is the iiist step ill a air route decision pro­ cess that is considered fast when com­ pleted within a year and usually takes more than three years, 
San Antonio’s attempts for tlireet service to Las Vegas was over rather quiekly, Rafferty said. 
.After initiation, the case was as­ signed to the CAB dtieket and petitions for inclusion in Hit* case were re- questeti. San Antonio and the olherx ai)|)lied. hut onlv Dallas was aeeepletl by CAB. 

Sail Antonio "cannot grow and diwelop unless there is a better (route) network within the next 1o years,* 

“ Tht'y don’t have to give a reason,” the aviation director said. “ There’s a standard catch phrase which begins 
‘We do not find it neceessary . . .’ that says ‘You don’t belong.’” 
Still working 

'I’ht* route request is still working its way through the twistt*d path of pre- hearing eonfert'nces, preparation per­ iods. hearings and appeals that makes up the CAB decision prueess. 
The second — the San Antonio vic­ tory of sorts ■— was a request lor a new route from Chicago to Montreal. 
San Antonio asked to be included in favor of establishing Hit* route, hoping it would be given to an airline pres­ ently serving the Alamo City. 
The inclusion was granted and, early this year, the new route was given to 
American Airlines. San Antonio tra­ velers can go — via American — to 
.Montreal with only one stop. 
"W e didn’t get the best we could but, on the other hand, it ctiuld have been worse,” Itafferty said. 

“TWA or United (Airlines) could have been awarded service and it wouldn’t have helped us at all.” 
The psuedo-judiciary ('A B process is often an adversary situation, according to Rafferty. Testimony, lawyers, briefs and even an administrative law judge are integral parts of the process which can help or hinder progress in cities across the country. 
“ It is too often a case of what we want or don’t want vs. what we want or don't want someone else to have rather than a solulitm of a problem,” he said. 
San Antonio doesn't have the funds to maintain a permanent staff to de­ fend the city’s interests before these prticeedings. Therefore, the job is a combined effort of the Aviation De­ partment, the Greater San Antonio 
Chamber of Conmieret* and one attor­ ney kept on retainer in Washington, 
D.C. 
In a way, Rafferty says, that is an advantage. “ We lend to shoot at defin- it targets rather than into the brush to see what will fail down.” he explained. 
“ We can accomplish what w^ ^ ieed for adequate participation in route cases at low cost,” he added. The standard fee for a consultant in this field is $5,oo1) to $7,ooo per case. 
“ Participation is necessary to con-

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BLOOMINOTON, Minn ~ While the heavyweights in the fast-food business slug it out for a bigger market share in the nation's cities. Dairy Queen has opted for a more placid road to profits. 
It’s a q uestion of image and of fin­ ancial resourct‘s, says Harris Coopt*r, president and chief ex ecutive officer of 
International Dairy Queen Inc. (IDQ). 
The Dairy (Jueen sign is seen in sm all towns and freq uently-crossed intersections — but seldom backed uj) against the McDonald's and Burger 
King restaurants that line “ fast-food row." 
Dairy Queen will not join the battle, sa.vs Cooper. 
".All of those people have trem en­ dously large resources and tt would be foolish for anyom'. who is doing well and growing, to get into that kind of fight just for the sake of trying to gain the No. I or 2 ranking in this in­ dustry," t'ooper said. 
"We try to avoid fast-food row and stay in com m unities where we ari' generally king," he added, 
DQ K i ng 
Dairy tiueen is king in a lot of filaces. 
The franchise, founded in 19 3K, has 
4,775 outlets, including 3(5o in Canada and MO in oth(‘r countries. 
IDQ op erates only 11 outlets and directly " franchises 2,233 other units.

Bur r s move in pair s 

What’s good far the goose . . . Little noticed in the move of University of 
Tex as at San .Antonio’s Dr. Pat B urr to associate adm inistrator of the Small 
Business .Administration was the si­ m ilar move of her husband. Currently dean of the Faculty of Business and 
M anagem ent Studies at Trinity Uni­ versity, Dr. Richard B urr will soon move — with his wife ~ to W’ashing- ton, D.C.. to become the assistant to the director of the scientific and tech­ nical information office of the National 
.Aeronautics and Sp ace .Adm inistra­ tion.

Sovi ets selli ng Cuba tri ps 

MONTREAL — The wily Russians advanced their schedule nearly a month to get “ first to Cuba” publicity. 
M/S Alexandr Pushkin will sail from here to Havana Aug. 18. 
Three days in Havana. Twenty-day cruise will run you $795 low to $1,615 high. (This $4o to $8o a day flows the 
Russian competitive line of cutting below other Caribbean cruises.) 
Ship carries 6oo. Air-conditioned. 
Makes stops at Bermuda, Gaspe, Nova 
Scotia and Nassau. 
Get visas now 

They say Americans can get visas from the Cuban Consulate in Canada or the Czechoslovakian Embassy in W a­ shington, D.C. I’d get a booking and on the ship — any travel agency — and start on that visa RIGHT NOW. 
I applied to the Czechs a couple of years ago. Filled out the mimeo forms and sent $6o for administrative fee. 
And that was the last I heard. No matter how friendly Carter and Castro, 
I ’d bet there’ll be time and red tape.

You can buy travel checks in other currencies: Swiss francs, German marks etc. i don’t see any advantage to it. Change U.S. checks at banks! Ho­ tels take a dollar to two dollars for each $1oo. Banks are modest. Probably charge you around 3o cents. 

Some people — the English par­ ticularly — get very chill when you tell them their hotels charge a cashing fee. 
They assure you that it’s impossible. 
That such rip-offs only happen in seedy countries in the Middle East. But they do charge. English, French, Italian. 
Spanish and so on. Oh yes, indeed they do. 

Travel checks are sold to you at a dollar for each $1oo. But most savings and loan companies give you F R E E travel checks if you have a sm all 

 deposit with them. So put a few dollars in their damper. Spend the check charge on Mother's Night Out. 

Our Man in Grand Bahama reports they've lured Jim m y “ the G reek” 
Snyder away from Las Vegas. “ The 
Greek” (you should know if you bet) is quoted on all kinds of odds. From horses to presidential elections. 

High rollers 

Grand Bahama is high-rolling dice country. But they didn’t bring “ The 
Greek” in to give you the chances on eight-the-hard-way. They’ll he running low-cost air charters called “ Jim m y the Greek Specials.” The project is being run by the three Princess hotels. 

“ How do people who work on airlines beat the jet lag?” 

Well, here's a choice of answers (1 wondered about that, too.) Stewardess 

 flying to Europe: "W e turn around and come back after one day. I get home , and go right to bed ” 

Captain of a 747 flying the same route: “ I wake up when I get hack home about 3 a.m. I get up and catch ig) on my paper work 1 think jet lag is largely imaginary.” 

Steward flying from the U .S. to 
Australia “ \ou have to overeome the desire to go to bed right away when you get there Like, if you get into Sydney at 3 in the afternoon, stay up until bedtime even if you’re collapsing. 
Sleep through the night and the next day you’re OK. " i 
Feel awful 

For myself, 1 expect to feel awful for a couple of days. (And I'm alw ays*v right.) Worst lag is when your body - turns on and you are wide awake at 3 , a.m. 

1 keep a paperback novel in my flight * bag. (Agatha Christie is great at this * time.) Before bedtime, 1 get the « kitchen to send up a themes jug of ¥ coffee and a few sandwiches. 

A small bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket of ice doesn’t hurt either. It

Chi li cookoffs gai ni ng steam 

SPECIAL TO THE E X P RE S S N E W S 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — That tangy Texas town of Terlmgua had better beware: More sizzling chili competition is brewing. 
Nevada will toss its proverbial spoon into the bowl with the First Annual 
Nevada Chili Cookoff June 9. 
The bubbly action will occur at Circus Hotel/Casino midway on the Las 
Vegas Strip. 
More than 29 contestants, including actor Larry Storch, will cook chili under the watchful eyes of a panel judges comprising Las Vegas personalities. 
There will be music, cheering squads, refreshments and hearty chili meals. 
Organized chili-cooking contests began about 1o years ago after a recipe appeared in a magazine article written by the late American humorist H. 
Allen Smith. 
Some Texas newsmen disagreed with Smith's recipe and a Texas journalist challenged the author to a cook-out in the Ghost town of 
Terlingua. 
Judges declared the match a draw, but with the publication of Smith’s best-selling account of the incident, “ The 
Great Chili Confrontation,” public interest was captured and the Chili Cookoff became an annual event.

 mile, except for short stretches where tiny Indian villages, pockets of poverty, are revealed. 
Here the Maya, many full-blooded, live much the same as their ancestors did. often worshipping some of the same gods, including Chat*. 
“ Why did they believe their god lived in the Cenote?” The dark- skinned, middle-aged Mexican guide posed the question to a family of for­ eign tourists who had hired him. 
These were the same English phrases he used almost in sing-song fashion day after day at the famed site. 
“ Because there are no surface streams or rivers in Yucatan,” he answered himself, explaining that rain would seep through the porous limes­ tone ground and be trapped below the surface by a hard layer of clay, thus forming underground pools and rivers. 
At Chichen Itza, the limestone cap had collapsed, forming a natural sinkhole,. 
Since the Maya wanderings were of­ ten .dictated by their need for water, and since water was life, the guide continued, the Indians concluded 
“ their rain god must be living at the bottom of the cenote." 
The tribe was called Itza, and the name Chichen Itza means simply “ at the edge of the well of the Itza.” 
Again I found myself filled with a sense of wonder abuul the people who

 had built the still-impressive struc­ tures ttiat surround me. 
The Maya, whose origin remains unclear, were immersed in religion and scientific discovery at a time w hen 
Europe was in darkness. 
Their priests were so adept at as­ tronomical observances that they de­ vised a calendar as accurate as the one we use today, predicted eclipses, un­ derstood and used the concept of zero many centuries before the Arabs, and created a system of hieroglyphic writ­ ing that scholars are still trying to fully decipher. 
Some experts believe that the Maya may descend from the mysterious 
“ Olmee,” a largely unknown civiliza­ tion that inhabited the Gulf Coast of 
Mexico about the time of'King David, more than 1,ooo years B.C. 
The most common theory holds that all the Indians of Mesoameriea des­ cend from bands of wandering hunters who migrated from Asia via a land bridge that originally existed across the Bering Straight. Successive mi­ grations occurred beginning at least 
12,ooo years ago. 
But some researchers maintain that there was also a migration from 
Southwest Asia across the Pacific 
Ocean, and that these meers of an ad­ vanced civilization brought with them the knowledge responsible for the un­ usual advances.

Laneer, who n ets out o f town at the probable time oj the theft so far as private-eve ^ Duke ' Rhoades can es­ tablish it after quizzing (and courting) pretty store clerk

 ibby Franklin had a townhouse-type apartment in a new development in an old area out north of Candler Park near Emory University. I followed her out in my ren­ tal. She had an old Volvo that looked as if it had been stomped flat and then pat­ ted back into shape by a huge, hasty child. She ‘un­ did three locks and defused the alarm system . Fido turned out to be a large gray altered tomcat, very impatient for his supper. 
As she waited on him, she had me fix drinks. 
The apartm ent was clean but cluttered, mostly with books, magazines, records and tapes. 
Second in a series 
Part 3 next Sunday 

“ I don’t really have any date-type dates, anything sincere,” Libby said. ‘‘This is my one night of the week without classes. Communi­ cations and Media. I should be studying this evening; but the thing is, nobody would listen to conjecture, you know? Just the facts, ni’am. Well, hell, that may be the legal way; but, after a couple of tries, I shut up because I do not like being classified as some kind of eossipy broad.” 
Fldo sat and washed a while. 
Finally, he cam e over to my chair and studied me for a long lime, then lowered his head and 

 started gently butting it against my leg while making a sound like a distant snare drum. Libby was astonished that he liked me, and 1 told her I was hurt that she should be so astonished — and how about the gossip nobody would let her mention officially? 
To prove, I guess, that she had an orderly and logical mind, 
Libby ticked off the facts 1 knew already. It had been known in the shop that J. Trevor Laneer would not be there on the Fhiday when apparently the theft took place. At night, a great deal of the stock was locked in the vault. There was a sturdy ca­ binet that locked with a key in' the rear portion of the vault. 
Laneer, Anne Farley, the book­ keeper and Laura Wheelock, who had been with the company almost as long as Anne Farley, knew the vault com bination. 
Only Anne Farley and Laneer had keys to the inner cabinet w here the best things were kept. 

Anne F a r l e y ’s vacation sta rte d on 
Monday. On the following Wednesday m orning. Lan eer rem oved a tray of rings from the cabinet to show an old and \alue:l custom er. He took a close look at one of the rin gs and becam e 
\t*ry agitated. In an hour, he kiK'w for sure that 32 rings had been switched. 
He informed the police and telephoned the news to F2quity f’ rotection. It was soon learned that Anne F'arley, age 35, had apparently left for good. She had given up the sh a d o w y old })aneled apartm en t in the downtown resident hotel w h ere sh e had lived with her mother until the latter’s death a b‘w years ago. and had kept on li\ ing alone in a motel.

I searchiM throu.gh the office files in my inside pocket and found the picture of Anne F’arley. “ She doesn't look un­ lovable,” I said to Libby.

Okay. In the color flash shots, she did not look lovable. She looktnl more like she would m ake you into a lam}>- shade. Grirn mouth, hair pulled tightly back and welded into a knot. It w as taken at an exhibit of jewelry designed l>y a fam ous actress.

Powerhouse Eureste is ha rd to intim ida te 

By KEMPER DIEHL 

Th ere was a lime wh en th e fu tu re lo o k ed d o wn rig h t rep el­ len t to Bern ard o Eu reste. 

A yea r out of Burba nk High School he wa s proving to be one of the more unpromising students a t Sa n Antonio 
ColU'ge. 
“ I wa sn’t m otiva ted.” reca lls Eur- este. “ And I wa s flunking more tha n I wa s pa ssing.” 
The solution? 
The 19 -yea r-old E u r este m et a nd ma rried his wife. And he prom ptly joined the U. S. Air Force. 
Now, 14 yea rs la ter. Eureste ha s turned his life 18 o degrees. 
T heoiie-tim eSA(’ dropout ha s ea rned gra dua te degrees in socia l work a nd public hea lth from the U niversity of 
Michiga n. 
He is a respected professor a t Our l.a dy of the La ke College, serving on key college com m ittees a nd a s director of a dmissions to the socia l work pro­ gra m. 

AND HE is a member of th e council which governs the na tion’s tenth la rgest city. 
Eureste joined the Air Force beca use a s he expla ins it. “ I felt a n obliga tion.” 
Tha t wa s J uly 3, 19 63. 
It wa sn’t long before he wa s serv ing a s a ra dio technicia n a t J a m e s Con- na ily AFB in Wa co. And it took even 

Po tp o u rri 

Peo p le a nd Po litic} 

 less tim e for Eureste to rea lize tha t his judgment a nd his bra ins were a s good a s those of a nyone else. 

He decided to go ba ck to college in his sp a r e tim e. B a ylor U n iv e r sity looked a t his previous low gra des a nd suggested he try his wings a t Temple 
J unior C ollege. So tw ice w eek ly he na de the 7o mile round trip. 

There is still a note of wonder in the professor’s voice a s he observ es, “ W'ho could believe you could get turned-on a t Temple Junior College? ” 

BUT 
THERE wa s a n 
English professor there from New York who roused students to critica l thinking. 

“ I found m yself rea ding ‘Pa ra dise 
Lost’ a nd getting a big ba ng out uf it,” reca lls E u reste. “ By tu rn in g on to wha t tha t professor wa s sa ying. I could produce. I found I could m a ke my own in te r p r e ta tion s .” 

It w a s n ’t long b efore B a ylor w a s ha ppy to a dm it E u reste to its night 

 school — a nd, of a ll things, the enlisted ma n found h im self v isitin g a c la s s ­ ma te, the ba se comm a nder, for even­ ing sessions of cocoa , cookies a nd ca l­ culus. 
The next big turning point ca m e a few yea rs la ter a s Elureste wa s nea ring a ba chelor’s degree in politica l science a t the University of Houston. 
He ha d b e c om e in v olv ed in the 
Humphrey ca mpa ign a nd met Leonel 
Ca stillo, who wa s la unching the politi­ ca l ca reer which w a s to lea d to his a p p oin tm en t a s th e first H isp a n ic comm issioner of the Immigra tion a nd

Ca stillo interested 
Eureste in a cha nce to becom e the first M exica n- 
A m erica n in the gra dua te School of 
Socia l Work of the U niversity of M i­ chiga n. 

TYPICALLY, Eureste seized the opportunity a nd moved with his wife a nd two young da ughters, Dia na , a nd 
Celia , to Ann Arbor. 
By the tim e Eureste ca m e ba ck to

This a ssu ra nce, in turn, is a n im ­ porta nt fa ctor a s the new councilma n a pproa ches his job. 
He simply is not intimida ted by the 
“ experts.” City Public Service Boa rd 
Cha irma n Tom B erg lea rned this a week a go. 
“ He ta lked down to u s ,” sna pped 
Eureste a fter Berg briefed the council on the proposed settlement of the ga s supply la wsuit. Eureste ma de it clea r he wa s not im pressed by B erg’s per­ forma nce. 

E U R E S T E ’S CRITICAL a lt i­ tude exte n d s to oth er city b oa rds, especia lly to the City Wa ter Boa rd a nd the trustees of the Sa n Antonio Tra nsit 
System. 
But he doesn’t stop with these. He sees no rea son why his District. 5 con­ stituents should not ha ve a full sha re of representa tion on a ll city boa rds a nd commissions. 

At the first regula r m eeting of the new c ou n c il, E u r e ste a sk ed fur a brea kdown, by district, of the m e m ­ bership of city boa rds a nd c om m is ­ sions. 
The councilma n wa nts to displa y the na mes of boa rd m em bers on a ma p in the City Ha l! lobby, giv in g citize n s w ith boa rd b u s in e s s a c h a n c e to identify m e m b ers from their n eigh ­ borhoods. 
Such a m a p just now would show 
“ tota lly u n eq u a l d is tr ib u t ion .” he points out. 
Eureste contends tha t District 8 on the Northwest side ha s 1o8 boa rd a nd com m ission m em berships, while D is­ trict 5 ha s only 11. 

BUT EVEN those 11 pla ces a re divided a mong only “ five or six people who a ctua lly reside in the district,” he sa ys. 
“ We ha ve one m a n who is on the 
Anima l Control Boa rd,” Eureste sa ys with a chuckle. “ H e’s a ma il ca rrier a nd sa ys he knows the ins a nd outs of dogs.” 
Eureste sees no rea son why his dis­ trict on the nea r Southwest side of the city should not ha ve its fa ir sha re of representa tion. 
“ If we do som e rea l close sea rching for people with energy a nd skills, we ca n find the representa tives we need.” he sa ys, a dding, “ The people of my district a rc just a s ca pa ble of doing a good job a s those of a ny other.” 
In his overa ll a pproa ch to city prob­ lem s, E ureste ha s two big goa ls: He wa nts to see a rea l progra m of long- ra nge pla nning a nd budgeting, a nd he wa nts to ta ke definite steps to revita ­ lize the downtown core of tiie city. 
Much of E u reste’s gra du'a te study ha s been in the a rea of a dministra tion a nd he reports he is a ppa lled a t the la ck of budgeta ry pla nning over per­ iods lon ger tha n a yea r. “ T h e r e 's nothing ma gica l a bout 12 m onths,” he sa ys. 

THE NEW councilma n ma y ha ve d efin ite id e a s , but he d e liv e r s his opinions in a low-key style a nd a ppea rs open to discussion. 
His service will not be without sa ­ crifice. Though the city a ttorney ha s ruled tha t there is no lega l conflict involved, Mrs. E u reste w ill lea ve a post a s a n inform a tion syste m s sp e ­ cia list with the city to fix'e her husba nd of a ny politica l questions tha t might be ra ised over her employment. 
“ I feel guilty,” sa ys the couuciima n. 
“ She wa s enga ged in a joi) she ('iijoyed thoroughly.” 
In a ddition. Eureste will lea ve u post a s project director of Educa tion for 
Minority Groups. The svvitcliiiig in fundiiig of his sa la ry to collt'ge sources will result in a drop of $.5,o(9) in his income this yea r. 

But E ureste is a ma n who sim ply ca nnot resist a cha llenge like council scrvici'. 
P on d e r in g rect'ntly h is busy schedule a s a councilma n a nd a pro­ fessor, E u r e ste ha d only tvxo I'om- pla ints. He observed:

“ Ruth, you wanted to die!” I sat in the library at my home listening to words I didn't want to hear but whieh 1 knew were true. It all seemed like a terrible nightmare — the hundred dif- t'erent pressures within, the disappointments and failures without. 

Until tin* friend seated aernss from me said that I wanted to die. it just seemed like an awful aeeident. I knew nothin,li about “ aeeident proneness“ or the “ will to die.“ I eertainly didn't think that my dedieati'd Christian life was beinK threatened by memori(‘s I eouldn't reeall — until yesterday mornin,i4. 
I was driving away from my home dovMi the .liradually sloping street that winds through our lovely subdivision in one of the “ nieer" parts of Fayelte- 
V die. N.C. When I i)rt*ssed on the brake, the pedal went to the floorboard. “ No brakes!” I screamed inside. I can’t remeiober just what happened. 

.As my tnend tiegan to qui'stion me about my childhood. I felt both fright­ ened and encouraged, be suggested that Jesus Christ could walk into the graveyard of my past pains, where I had buried alive so many experiences, resurrect them, and change the ugli­ ness that haunted and drove me un- conlndlably into beautiful memories and healthy patterns of behavior that would bless me torever. Too good to be true? Well. I thought so. Hut like manv

 who have hit rock bottom. I had no­ where else to go. 
My friend offered to pray for the 
“ healing of the memories.” I didn’t understand what he meant. My life had been lived in prayer. His proposal could l)e one more of those too-good- to be-true “ solutions” that solve noth­ ing. 
What I experienced began to bring stability to my life. 1 learned that inner healing is a process, not a moment. It is, in fact, a means of accelerating the emotional growth that is the natural product of following the person and words of Jesus Christ. 

I HAD been raised to believe that I was God's gift to the world, the most lieautiful child ever born. I was led to bt'lieve that I was the most talented, the most gifted of persons. 1 grew up thinking I was queen of the universe. 
When 1 went away to college and later when I married, I was shocked to discover an inability to cope normally with life. I was not the best, the most beautiful, the most loved all. I didn't have all the an.svvers. and I was almost totally unable to make decisions. 
During this dark period I found a living faith in God. Jesus Christ be­ came my life and I surrendered con­ trol of my troubled existence to the 
Spirit. (1 was glad to let go.) This ex­ perience began the healing process. I had a new life just as Jesus promised. 
It was no warmed-over theology; I knew the love of Christ. I saw the miracle of His love heal the sick, res­ tore broken lives, inspire one to self­ less service. 

First of a series 

Continues Monday in the Express 

When I had begun my Christian life. 
I learned that Jesus said that I must be last and least. My father had taught me that I was first and best. I began to realize that this was why it was so hard for me to “ work out my salvation." to become a whole, stable person. At this point I jumped out of my car. 
Over a period of months the man who prayed for the healing of my deep mind, that region which carefully re­ cords and stores every experience of life, led me back behind the locked doors of my memory. 
I bt'gan to see the root of jealousies and hales that tortured me and hurl and disappointed others. Seeing the problem was not lu'aling in itself, but understanding is the light that pre­ cedes the day of healing if one wills to be healed. 

THE EXPERIENCE of inner healing begins when some circu m ­ stance such as a spiritual experience, ail insight created by some healing method applied either psychologically or spiritually, or the will to be whole occurs. 
Of course this last factor, the will to be whole, lies behind every experience of healing. W hen in the depths of seeming hopelessness one wills whole­ ness. he or she can begin to draw all that is needed for healing. The econ­ 

 omy of the universe is built on love and operates on w ill. It doesn’t m atter what I feel; what I will to experience is what will finally be. 
The life of your mind is a wonderful and mysterious part of the universe. 
.'Vnyone who claims to understand it knows nothing of its d(>pth. God can restore the mind to life; we can’t, any more than we can create new brain tissue. 

But where there is that sense of life which the love of Jesus Christ brings, we can give ourself to the task ol cut­ ting out the old sick memories and replacing them with new rich images in our deep mind. These new images lead to vvhohv constructive living. 
Mary .Ann admitted that her m ar­ riage was miserable. Sht* loved her children. Sli<‘ said it was worth the pain of her marital difficulties just to be thihr mother. Sin* loved her fius- band, too. but why were things with him going down the drain'.’ 

 and great puzzle to m any 

“ Could it Im* that what you’re doing in bed. and out of bed too, is sending messages to your husband? The adult message is. i want your love and af­ fection.’ The second is the little girl message, i don’t expect you to love me. I exjiect you are like my fath(*r I expi'ct you to be distant and unaffec- tionate. .And your inner rejecti'd child resents this expectation. . 
“ If you want to follow this through to healing, Mary Ann, 1 want you to go back in your memory, or in your ima­ gination. to the a.g<* where you can re­ call wanting your father’s affeition, wh(*n you remember most deeply the pain of not having it.” 
“ Let’s see” We sat in silence as she thought. “ I remember when I went to my first dance. I was IJ. IVly mother and I had madi* my first ev eiiing gown, and 1 was rt‘ally excited. I felt iiot-so- drab, almost pretty. 
“ Aft(*r I had every hair in place. ! walked out into the living room to wait for my dale, and daddy was reading tin* newspa|H*r. 1 remember 1 fell for weeks the hurt that daddy didn’t say a word about me or my pretty dross He just kept his head buried in that damned newspaper!" 

I TURNED to Mary Ann. looked her full in the face, and then asked; 
“ Is Nick affectionate toward you’.’” 
“ He was when we were first m ar­ ried. But never any more. Except when we got bed Then he gets all lovey, and 
I resent it 1 feel like he’s jusl using me.” 

“ THAT’S 
HELPFUL, M ary 
.Ann. Close your eyes now and go bai'k in your imagination to that living room on tin* night you des<-ril»ed.” I silently prayed. “ Lord, heal h(*r ln*art” 
“ All right. I ’m there, she said. 
“ Do you see your fatlu*r reading tin* in*wspapt*r?” 
“ I sure do ! waul to tear it out of his 

 hand and say, 'Look at me, dadfly'” * 
‘Before >ou do anything. Mary .Ann. look toward the front <loor 
See it opening Sec Jesus walking in ” 
As quickly as I st*t tin* scene slie said. “ ! see him” 
“ N on see .h*sus‘’” 
“ ^ es.” sin* responde<f quickly “ He walked in and is standing by tin* oil stove.” 
“ Let him come ovor to you and tell you how lovely you look” 
“ Oh. my soul, what a b(*aiiliful man he is” 
“ Yes. he is. What does he think of you’" 
“ He says I’m beautiful. He says he's very proud of me. that he would be proud to lake me out.” Tears were flowing from Mary Ann’s eyes. “ He kissed me.” 
I'm perpetually awed by how ln*au- tifully tin* Spirit works 
“ Now, M.iry Ann. let Jesus go ovt*r to your father. .See a radiant liglit flow from Jesus into your fath(*r.” 
“ Dad«ly s put the papt*r down He’s looking up at iiu*” 
“ If your daddy was flooded with the 
Spirit of Jesus, what do you think your daddy would do?” 
“ He'd come to me and love m e” 
"Let him ." Then came that moment of reconcilalioii and understandiiut I had seen so many times before, but it 
Is always new. always sacred 
“ Daddy, I forgive you,” Mary Ann said through her tears “ I know you didn't know, but I just couldn't help how cheated I felt.” 

I S UGCÍES TED that she imagine her husband. Nick, coming into the room. Then, as she had experienced the forgiveness for her fat her. I suggest et! that she forgive Nick and that Nick forgive hi*r. 
When the two. the Inisltatnl and wile, were rectniciletl in Christ's healing love, I told Mary Ann, " Try to spentl a little time each day visnali/ing Jesus coming in Hie door from work. Then st't* yourself walking up to him, em ­ bracing him. Say to .lesus, ‘It’s good to have you home. Nick.’ 
“ If you do this t'ach day, you will condition yourself to respond tin* Nicfj as you would rt*spond to Jesus Months could go by before yon observe any visible results. But each time ytni tio it, you will nourish and slrt'ugthen that innt'r child. This is the most powerful prayer you can |nay for your hus­ band”

A SSO C IA TED PRESS 

N EW ARK, N.J. - Think of it as one giant electronic black­ board in the sky, with .scientists, all over the country working on it whenever they want to. 

The “ blackboard” is a new com­ puter system — called computerized conferencing — an alternative to the use of papt*r itself, designed to break down the barriers of time and dis­ tance. 
An experimental program of this 

 kind, involving 221 individuals in 33 groups of investigators, is just going into operation at the New Jersey Insti­ tute of Technology. It is aimed at prov iding new forms of communica­ tion in science and technology, but similar systems may some day reach right into your living room. 
This system employs term inals 

 around the country tied to a cen­ tralized computer system at N JIT by ordinary telephone. It allows .scientists to send messages to each other. It eives each member his or her own 
“ notebook.” It replaces face-to-face contact at expensive and time-con­ suming conventions. And it can even provide a coffee break, with scientists sitting around their computer termin­ als, telling jokes. 
Beyond all this, the people directing 

 the project say that computerized con­ ferencing, despite its form idable name, will have more common, every­ day uses in the future. All that is 

Si}med a y yo u ma y rep o rt to wo rk b y sitting a t a co mp uter co nso le in yo ur ho me. So me scientists a re d o ing tha t no w.

 needed for that to happen is for the price to come down as equipment is mass produced, just as the price of pocket electronic calculators came down. 

Th is b ig p u b lic blackboard could 

 lie used for widespread education pro­ grams. to provide recreation, help lobbying groups get together, hold town meetings. 
“ Any such applications of compu­ terized conferencing systems would be likely to lead to widespread changes in work patterns and lifestyles," says Dr. 
Starr Roxanne Hiltz of Upsala College, who is working with Dr. Murray Tu- roff, a computer scientist and designer of the system. 
“ There is no reason why one’s ter­ minal, and thus place of work, has to be separate in lime and space from one’s place of living or leisure. Wher­ ever there’s a telephone, you can plug into your computer and your confer­ ences and go to work, whenever it suits you. 
“ This is Eispecially important for 

 women,” Dr. Hiltz says, “ to facilitate time budgeting between family and career. If you can work in your own home, whenever it suits you, there won’t bt* those minor crises that make it so difficult for the parent responsible for child care, such as what to do when the baby sitter doesn’t come or if your 

 school-age-child is sick. One will be able 

 to stay home near the children and work. 
Overall, computer conferencing 

 will mean more substitution of com­ munication for transportation for all white collar workers. Men, as well as women, will be able to opt for work in their homes or neighborhood centers much of the time instead of commut­ ing daily to central city offices. 

“Th is wou ld cu t down on use of 

 the automobile, with the attendant en­ ergy and pollution problems it causes, and on tlie suburban sprawl which grows out of the necessity for the ex­ panding middle class to live within daily commuting distance of downtown office centers.” 
F’or the immediate future, however, 

 the system will provide more efficient scientific communication. It is built with the idea of the “ invisible college” in nind: informal groupings of scien­ tists whose interests transcend their own universities and link them with scientists in the same field across the country. 
Members of these “ invisible col­ leges” communicate a lot now by tele­ phone, mail, journals, at meetings. 
The new computer system, called 
E IE S or “ eyes.” (for Electronic Infor­ mation Exchange System) is built for this need. 
The new system, supported by the 

Natonal Science Foundation, has se­ veral major features; 
1. A message system. Any one 

 member can send a message to any other or all. The message can be in­ formal or temporary, and disappears from the system a week later. A mes­ sage will wait for the recipient to sign in on the system at his or her leisure. 
The message system is economically competitive with the telephone and mail. 
2. The conference, a running series 

 of short papers and discussions on a specific topic. The computer replaces a three-hour or three-day seminar. Or the computer conference could run on for weeks or months, with members signing in and contributing when they choose. 
The computer keeps order. “ When 

 do you want to begin?” it asks. The researcher can ask for all contribu­ tions since he was last on-line, or ask for a particular person’s remarks, or ask for everything from a certain date. 
There also is a human moderator to control membership and discussion. 
“ Socially, you can participate more 

 evx*nly.” Dr. Hiltz says. “ No one can gel the floor and shout down the slower thinkers or talkers.” 
On the other hand, this imperson­ ality can have obvious disadvantages. 
Till* social and emotional aspects of face-to-face meeting will be absent. “ A person is likely to feel a bit like a robot after several hours alone in a room 
'talking' to a machine,” says Dr. Hiltz. 
Hart of the f*\periment is to try to build

 she looked a long time at tin* drawing 
— the one where in* gave her blonde bangs to her eyt*brows — then poked around in her files, liiting h<*r lip, frowning, and came up with a card that said she had sold such a blonde person a round-trip ticket, tourist class, for two p(*opl(*, Atlanta to Uan- cun. Cash money, for a Mr. and Mrs. 
Dan Barley. More anagrams. She fi­ gured it was an illicit pair slipping away for fun and games. 
“ The woman buys, cash deal, no re­ servation on return. 
So what slie did was tell the blonde person that sh<* was going to have to get tourist cards, and she could fill out the blank there and take one for her husband, or they could do it at the Mexicana desk in the M ia­ mi Airport. They would hav<* to show birth certificates, jiassports or so­ mething like that. She recalled the blonde person had seeiiH*d a little up­ set at that but said they would apply at 
Miami.” 
Libby .scowled down at me. “ Anne 
Farley? Fun and games?” 
“ There is alw ays somebody for everybody.” I said. “ The reservation was made three weeks in advanci* for the Sunday flight, with a two-hour layover in Miami before catching tin* i);3o flight to Cancún. Did th(* Dan 
Barley couple catch it? Who knows*' 
Maybe passenger manifests are tucked away into s<ime computer sonu'where, with no awareness or access except in the m icro-electrical heart ol some other computer.” 
“ So?” she said. 
I tried a fixed le(*r. staring up at her. 
“ Wanna go to Yucatan, swt*elie?” 

“ 1 can’t take off work, and Fido hates kennels and sitters, and 1 seldom go out of the country without being married first." 
“ 1 could go ask that neat redheaded lady.” 
“ W ith all the ring s? Sure. Good thinking. She can probably gel you a discount on everything. Bite him, F i­ do. Sic’urn.”

I plodded into VVeseolt and Sons ri^hl after my hotel coffee-shop breakfast, braced for a lot of re.sistance from J. Trevor Laneer. But he greeted me with a rueful smile, waved me into the deep leather once again and said, “ Fm glad you came back, Mr. Rhoades.

Fu n d in g CPS for city good 

One thing m o re co stly than 
San Anto nio ’s massive invest­ ment in its electric po wer sy stem is the failure to invest ad eipiately . 
The c ity 's f utur e wo uld d ead ly gra y by b ro w n-o uts. 
Cities acro ss the So utheast and many in the No rtheast have seen what lo ss o f pt)wer can d o and 
1 he pla n n e r s who lo cate and build .io b-generating businesses put ad (Hiuate po wer at the to p o f their lists o f lo catio n r e quire ­ ment 
In term s o f eco no mic health, investment in ad equate energy is the best a c o m m un ity can make. 
We d o n ’t m e a n e x t r a va ­ gance. We mean ad equacy . 
City Public Service has had 
Its turbulent times and pro bably will ha \e mo re, but the d irectio n no w being taken is well-planned and prud e n t. 
T he 
T ex as 
R a ilro ad C o m m issio n has a l ­ read y warned that electric gen- 
(M'atio n fro m gas-fired bo ilers lias a limited future. CPS was caught with scant capacity to generate with o ther fuels when it was trapped in a co ntract d is­ ho no red by Co astal States Gas 
I o rp. 
But that hand icap has been o verco me by (juick co nversio n to fuel o il with new co al-fired gen­ e r a t o r s abo ut re a d y to s ta r t o perating. Within a few y ears. 

CPS will also have ad d ed energy fro m the nuclear-fueled So uth 
T ex as P r o je c t, in w hic h San 
Anto nio is partner. 
CPS will have to c o n ve rt o ther generato r units to o il and build mo re co al units as gas be­ co mes either lo o ex pensive to burn o r until it is taken away fro m (d ectric po wer co mpanies as a fuel. Kngineers and scien­ tists have argued fo r y ears that natural gas is far lo o valuable to burn und (‘r bo ilers. That a rgu­ ment is alread y being accepted as stale and natio nal po licy . 
Thus, investm ent in plants capable o f using o ther fuels is inescapable fo r any city with a ho pe o f co mpeting with the fu­ ture. 
City C'o uncil ho ld s the fate fo r fund ing the pro gram and , given time to abso rb the d ata, it will appro ve the nex t in sta llm e n t because there are no practical o ptio ns. The size o f the jo b, o n d o llar terms, can be staggering until perspective is und ersto o d . 
New co uncil m e m b e r s are being respo nsible in asking fo r time to stud y the figures and to und erstand their significance. 
Electric po wer plants are who p­ ping investments — but they are essential to the well-being o f abo ut a millio n peo ple who live here. The plants a re built fo r lo ng-life reliability and sho rt­ cuts aren ’t available. 

Pressu re on b ord er n eed s b ilateral fix 

The Ü. S.-Mex ican bo rd er is a tro ubleso me o ne ~ fo r bo th co untries. 
And where there is tro uble, there are tho se who will ex jilo it 
It. Last week’s incid ents at El 
Paso sho w the po tential fo r d is­ co rd . They also sho w the urgent need fur bilateral co nsultatio ns o n a co ntinuing basis in search o f to lerable po licies. 
The Carter ad ministratio n is try ing to shape such a po licy . 
The Mex ican go vernment wants a m o re - c o m pre he n s ive aj)- pro ach to the alien pro b le m which the U.S. seeks to attack o n a less-co mprehensive m anner. 
'I'here are talks in pro gress o n capital fund assistance fo r d e­ velo pment o f Mex ican o il — a plan that co uld generate many new jo bs in Mex ico . 
It seems the d iscussio ns have pinpo inted tho se things that ap- pt‘ar unacceptalile. That leaves the hard part — find ing tho se things which a re a c ce ptab le . 

So lutio ns will take m o re time. 
P ressures o n the b o rd er stem fro m lack o f jo b o ppo rtunity in 
Mex ico and it takes time to d e­ velo p mo re jo bs. 
It is go o d po licy to give Mex ­ ico the kind o f c o n sid e ratio n merited by its lo catio n, its po si­ tio n as lead ing trad ing partner in the he m isphe re , by the po ­ tential it has as a majo r supplier o f even m o re go o d s a n d s e r ­ vices. includ ing o il. and by the inescapable fact that to the ex ­ tent Mex ico is impo verished the alien pro blem will wo rsen in the 
U. S. There are bo th self-inter­ est and eco no mic interests to co nsid er. 
,‘\ny po licy must assum e that the pressure o n the bo rd er will co ntinue until it is eased thro ugh eco no mic impro vement in Mex ico . The two go vernments seem d eterm ined to wo rk co o ­ peratively to ward that go al if frustratio ns can be kept in check that lo ng. 

I GOT YOU THIS FAR. PIPN'T I ? " 
Dazzler DA really k n ows th e PR game 

One o f the- favo rite sa y in gs circulating the Co urtho use go es so m e thin g like, “ If y o u c a n ’t d azzle them w ith y o ur b r i l ­ liance baffle the m with vo ur 
B.S.’’ 

.\ny o ne can tell y o u there are pro ba­ bly m o re baffled fo o ls w alking the 
Co urtho u.se halls than any where else in the co unty , but it has been suggested that the hilario us slo gan be altered so mewhat to fit District Atto rney Bill 
Wlnte. 
It wo uld go . “ If y o u can't d azzle them w ith y o ur brilliance, go rge them with press co nferences." 
No w no bo d y ’s (piestio ning the intel­ ligence o f the new DA. ile’s sharp, all right. He’s retained and ex pand ed the ex cellent staff left him by Ted Butler when B utler as­ cend ed to a d istrict co urt jud geship. 
And altho ugh he’s iieen bo ss o f the third flo o r o ffice fo r o nly a co uple o f mo nths. White s e e m s co mpetent As well as inno vative in his new d uties. 

BUT THIS guy ’s an abso lute whiz kid when it co mes to d ealing with the med ia. 
Who co uld o pen a term as d istrict atto rney with the surrend er o f a legend in her o w n time — Ro sa Carrasco ’.’ 
The my stery wid o w o f Fred Go mez 
(.’arrasco sud d enly d ecid es to surface after a 2‘'2 .vear escape fro m so ciety . 
'I'he curio us thing abo ut he r s ur ­ rend er to White is that she had no cri­ minal charges pend ing in Bex ar Co un­ ty . 
But that has no thing to d o with the fact she turned herself in to White o nly a few d ay s after he to o k o ffice. 
White, no t wanting to cater to any o ne m e d ium , called a press co nfer- em-e. 

REPORTERS BROKE o ut in a co ld sweat, began to gasp fo r air and 

 generally went crazy . Tho se who had slept so und ly at ty pewriters fo r y ears were sud d enly jo lted back to life. 
Im agine — Ro sa C a rra se o in the flesh. 
Only a f te r the d ust s e ttle d , the head lines printed and the new d istrict atto rney pho to graphed with Ro sa, d id repo rters ask the cpjestio n, “ What d id 
Bill White have to d o with all o f this’.’” 
But what the heck. It m ad e great co py . And the med ia ate it up. 
Things had settled o nly fo r a sho rt time when White had repo rters in an­ o ther tizzy . 

Altho ugh there were r um o rs o f a press co nference, it never actually materialized when he filed suit to shut d o wn a m assage parlo r because, he claimed , it was a haven fo r pro stitu­ tio n. 
The civil suit was a new tactic to wipe o ut parlo rs in the city and when I 
(|uestio ned o ld so urces abo ut this star­ tling new metho d , the message came o ut clear — “ Use Bill White’s name in y o ur sto ry . No bo d y kno ws who he is y et.” 
In fact o ne so urce gave me a nice ex planato ry quo tatio n, and then to ld me to attribute it to Bill White. 
I to ld him I d i d n ’t think it quite ko sher to quo te White when he d id n’t actually make the statement. 
The so urce finally agreed to talk if I wo uld mask his id entity and play up 
White’s name. 

AND THEN we had White’s first d rug raid . 
It was all very ex citing. The grand jury returned 133 sealed ind ictments abo ut 9 o ne mo rning. 
By abo ut 9:45 a.m., every big d o pe pusher in to wn knew a slew o f sealed ind ictments had co me d o wn, which al­ mo st alway s m e ans the narcs were go ing to be o ut in full fo rce that even­ ing. 
Und erstand ably , quite a few cho se no t to stay at ho me that evening since the d o pe ro und -up was sched uled . 
Subsequently , a lo t o f small-timcrs, unwise to the wo rld o f sealed ind ict­ ments, were at ho me watching tele­ visio n when the po lice rapped at their d o o rs. 

THE BIG questio n here is why no t arrest these fo lks may be the night be­ fo re the ind ictments are returned so that all the wo rld wo n’t kno w a raid is planntHl. 
It’s d efinitely mo re d ra m a tic this way , but it d o esn't seem lo gical to let peo ple kno w y o u are go ing to arrest them befo re y o u get to their ho uses. 

ON ONE hand . White’s actio ns are un d e r s t a n d a b l e . He w a n ts and he need s peo ple o ut the re in the eo m- munity to . kno w that he is fighting 
'd o pers and o ther criminal-ty pes. 

.And White really sho uld be patted o n the back fo r effo rts to co o perate with the med ia. 

Lo ng befo re he was d istrict atto rney he was willing to answer tho se sticky questio ns that o thers in that o ffice so artfully d o d ged . 

And fo r that co o peratio n. I’m appre­ ciative. But I d o n’t like to feel I’m being used . 

Mr. White, please d o n’t USE ME. 
I’m alread y to o baffled by the d ebris fly ing aro und o ur co urtro o ms.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sundoy Moy 29 1977 

Ya nqui si, Cuba no ! 

Sir: In the yfl-io-be-explaitUHl-why euphoria about the possibility of ren ewin g I ’niltHj Slales-C'uba relation s, one finds amon g recent traxelers to 
(. uba the most absu rd, ignoran t, an d ridiculous accounts about life today in that C om m u n ist island. F or in stan ce. Sen. McGovern has been quoted as l>eing swayed by, a m on g other things. F'idel Castro's "da n c in g eyes." 
More to the point, however, is .lohn F re iw a lds’ report about Cuba (San 
Antonio Express-News. April 27.) 
Mr. F re iw a lds’ accoun t of the won ders of Culia can be excust'd only on the basis of sh eer ign oran ce. It a ppears that Mr. F'reiwalds has no idea alMiut what Cuba was like l)efore the t.'ommun ists took over. For Freiwalds to say that un der the Com m un is t regime "w ork an d study . . . have brought 
Cuba the highest stan dard of li\in g in Latin A m e ri c a " is to ackn owledge a dis m a l ig n n r a n c e ab out C uba an d Latin A m e ri c a . Of c ou rse, the 
CommunLsts claim the .same thing, which is a big lie, but that is somethin g else. 1 hav e no reason to believe Freiwalds is a Comm un ist or a C ommun ist sympathizer. 
How can Cuba enjoy the highest stan dard of living when as recen tly as last F e b ru a r y, Curren t History poin ted out that, because of its low productivity. "C uba re quire s a daily infusion of $2 million to $3 million in aid from the Soviet U n ion " an d that " t h e Havan a regim e is now as depen den t on the Soviet Union as it was on the United States" prior to the 
C ommun ist takeover. 
How can Cuba u n der Castro be con sidered to have the highest stan dard of living in Latin American when Freiwalds in dicates that Castro had to 
“ ration expen sive coffee im port s as the mon ey was n eeded . . . in other parts of the e con om y? " Anyon e w ith an ele m en ta ry know ledge about Cuba knows that Cuba used to export coffee. Cuba used to export coffee prior to the Comm un ist takeover. Now Cuba has to im port it an d can n ot even afford to do that! How is that for a high st an dard of living? 
Mr. Freiwal ds goes on to assert that someon e in Cuba was willing to buy his old g ym shoes for 4o pesos, yet he has the audacity ~ or ignorAnce — to write that 1 Cuban peso eq uals U.S. $1.2o! T he fact is that the Cuban economic syste m is so bad off that the Cuban peso is worthless, for there is nothin g to buy in Cuba worth an ythin g today! 
Mrs, Freiw a lds also c laim s that “ food prices have not ch an ged sin ce 
19 65, ren t is 6 to 1o per cen t of your salary, an d education an d medicin e are free.” Why should prices ch an ge if there is no food to sell? The C omm un ist regime in Polan d quickly found out w hat an in crease in the price of scar ce food ite ms can do to a political system: riots an d strikes threaten ed it. The sam e thin g happen ed in Egypt recen tly. And so it would happen in Cuba. 
Therefore prices a re kept down, but. again , t h a t ’s irrelevAnt. The point is that production is so low that there is n othin g to buy. 
Most item s are ration ed, such as milk, meal, bread, an d so on to even oran ges. I un derstan d that you need a doctor’s prescription to buy or­ an ges in Cuba! Did you know that oran ges w ere as plentiful in Cuba as they a re in Florida or Californ ia? In fact. Cuba used to export its citrus products to the United Stales an d still had a lot of oran ges left for 
C u b a n s to buy t h e m two for a pe n n y! 
T h i s w a s pr i o r to 
C om m un is m in Cuba, of course. 
.As for the ren t, how could that be relevan t vvht*n the landlord is the g ov e r n m e n t ? If the g ov e r n m e n t keeps your ren t low, it certain ly can ma k e it up elsewhere. And, in Cuba, it does. This explain s the workin gs 
<»f most Cuban s, like the “ grucelul 
•guit ar pla ye r an d s i n g e r at the 
Hotel R iv iera" that Mr. Fre iwalds m en tion s in his article. He was amazed to learn that this girl works three hours at the hotel at night, after workin g all day long at the sam e place in the laun dry room. 
She also atten ds "n utrition c la sses” and. on weeken ds, “ she tr ain s with the wom en 's militia." 
The (juestion is, how m uc h does 
^he get for all this work? No won der the govern men t — her em ployer — allows her to pay very low rent! 
F u r t h e r m or e , does she have an y choice? Could she refuse to " tra in with the w om e n ’s m ili ti a" or work at the laun dry? Certain ly not! A’ou i-annot choose your job un der the 
Commun ist regim e in Cuba! A’» » u do as you a re told! Is this a sign of 
"high stan da rds of livin g?" Who is 
Mr. Freiwal ds kiddin g? 
.\s for education an d medicin e. 
Yes. we a re ttdd that the literacy rate in C ommun ist Cuba is 9 S per cent. But. have you ever st>en a definition of this " l i t e r a c y? " .At what g r a de level ca n the adu lt 
Cuban read or write? Sixth g ra de level? F'ourth? What kind of r e a ­ s on i n g pr oc e s s ca n t a k e pl a c e am on g such "lit e ra te s " when only the Com m un is t line is allowed to be taught at schools? I m a g i n e our population bein g able to read n oth­ ing but what, say. churc h fu n da ­ men talists allow us to read. What relevan ce does such a rule of liter­ acy have? 
.As C u r r e n t H is tory i n di c a te s , 
"de spite efforts at diversification , suga r an d its derivatives still g e n ­ e ra t e m or e than 8o |jcr cen t of 
Cuba’s hard curren cy, an d the n a­ tion’s econ omy has been jidted by a recent sh a rp decline in world suga r pr i c e s to oi i e - s e v e n t h of t h e i r late-19 74,” Because of this. Cuba now faces " a severe ba la n c e of paymen ts deficit an d a decision to ration importan t staples like rice, meal an d coffee, the is la n d’s favor­ ite b everage." Is this the picture of a nation with tlie "highest st an dard of living ill Latin .America?" 
No won der Castro is so willing to trade with the United Stales! The incredible thin g is that promin en t figures such as 
Sen. 
George 
^lcG^>vern an d others who with him 
V isited the C ommun ist island a re so insistent in bailing Castro out of his misery! .As rt*cently pointed out in 
(he U.S. News an d World Report 
(see Patrick .1. Buchan an . San .An­ tonio Express. .April ‘2h>. " C a s t r o’s foreign debt is now $li billion or roughly (91 per cent of C uba ’s G.NP" and of this. "C astro owes some 81.3 b il lion to 
W e s t e r 
E u r o pe a n countries. .Annual service on this debt is eatin g up half the hard c u r ­ r e n c y C u b a t ' u r n s in its e xpor t trade.” The rest of the delit is owed to the Soviet Union. 
In s u m m a r y. I believe that .Mr, 
F r e i w a l ds ’ article about Cuba is m i sle a din g , full of e r r or s about actual con dition s in Cuba, deceiv­ ing. an d to the extent that its aulhor appears to honestIv believe what he has written aliout Culia. the article is naively conceived.

Sir: How sweet of T om Berg to suggest in creasin g property taxes. 
T h a t’s all we need! 
T axpayers are already ov er-bu r­ dened with heavy tuxes which in ­ creased con siderably u n der Charles 
Davis, who acted like he was G od’s gift to the taxpayers. 
E s pe c i a l l y ol de r c i t i z e n s on small, fixed in comes will suffer the most. Some are still u n de r Hri an d c an n ot c la i m spe c i a l re du c t ion , others are widows with children to take care of. It’s still heaven to be able to live in your own home. 
Mr. Berg acts an d talks like Os­ c ar Wyatt's sateliite. 
Since he has en ough mon ey an d m ake s en ough to live on comfor­ tably, he doesn 't give a hoot about us the taxpayers, who are already hit by sky high utility bills.

Sir; T here see m s to be n ation wide concern over the spoils system re ­ turn in g to the federal civ il service with the repeal of the Hutch ^ct; however. 1 thought you an d your reader s should be m ade aw a re of an even more horren dous attem pt to rape civ il service law right here in 
Sun Antonio. 
The issue in question is a dem a n d by the city of Sun Antonio to appoin t ail m e m b e r s of the fire de pa rtm e n t to the ran k of captain an d above without merit examin ation s. These men could then be de moted without an appeal process through the civil service c om m ission . T h is is the issue which forced the fircfiglitcrs and city into court on last ye a r ’s 
I'ontract an d it is an obvious at- li'inpl l>y tlie city to rein stat e a spoils sys tem in lh<' fire ilcpart- tru'til. 
It IS mv fervent hope that the eiti/cn s of San Antonio will be m a de aware id' tins political g a m e the « *ity is trying to play and will m ak e a coticerleil effort to correct this in- lusticc.

NEW YORK - Fo r 
(id y ears, Ru ssian p ain tin g h as re ­ main ed as mu rk y a m y stery as So v iet d o mestic p o litics. 
So the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art‘s “ Rus­ sian and Soviet Paint­ ing,” lent by the CSSR 
Ministry of Culture, pro­ vides a peek, though not much more, at what s been going on since (he 
1!H7 Revolution, and a somewhat broader view of earlier art. . 
While some Ruusian ait, from 13th century icons through early 2oth century oils, can be viewed 111 scattered col­ lections outside that na- t ion. tm one can get a comprehensive look without going there. 
Even then, the country is so vast, art s o dispersed and the sheer number of tilings to see so great, that even scholars run out of time, money arid patience. 
If the loti works in 
“ Russian and Soviet 
Painting” are a mixed bag. a few quite beautiful canvases emerged. For me, the loveliest and, in a way. the strangest paint­ ing in the show is a rea­ list landscape. “ The 
Birch Grove,” painted in 
1S79 by the native Ek- ranian, Kuindzhi. At first glance it appears three- dimensional, but a se­ cond look s h o w s 
1! to have been painted in two planes — near and far —

NEW YORK - At the start of the next centur>' it may well be possible to look baek on these years of the 197os and identify this very particular period--- if not as the turning point from the Oíd Movie to the New, then as the time when New Movies began to supplement Old in such number that it wasn’t always easy to tell them apart. 

The sitnafum is disor­ ienting, To experience some current movios is 
!o go scuba-diving in murky water. Which way is up'^ 
This, I think, has as much to do with the var­ ious degrees of turn-off we all feel in relation to certain film s as with whether or not the films art* really any good 
Robert A ltm an 's “ .‘5 
Women" is very much a 
New 
M ovie, but its dream like form makes that self-evident. We don't expect to be told everything. We ~ espe­ cially if we have ad­ mired Altman’s work in the past — are prepared make all sorts of to adiustments when htok- ing at one of his films, which we aren't when, say, we watch a rather absurb littU* hor­ ror film like Lu rry Co­ hen’s " i t ’s Alive" (about a murder*ms newborn ch ild ), which is also a 
New Mov ie. 
It says som ething abiuit the movies' tradi­ tional role as a mjiss en lertainm ent m edium 
(which, of coiirM*. is no longer true) that so many people who have peace­ fully and som etim es eiUhusiasticaliy acce()ted 

 experiments in drama, fiction and painting, re­ fuse to allow filmakers to st'ck new form s of ex­ pression. 
That ('ould be bei’ause the new movie forms of expression don’t look so flamboyantly new. If they did. tlu're would be a lot less troubb' Nobody is running old socks through the projector and callin g it art. 
New 
M ovies look like Old 
Movies but they aren’t providing (he same kind of reU'asi*. 
There is also a lot of reverse snobbism in ­ volved in the way New

 sujiposed to be differ»*nt frmn what they were when we were kids. This 
IS the sort of person wh<» go(‘s to see "H ocky" and 

 and more than he cares to wa.ste his time by ex­ plaining. There’s seldom any music on the sound­ track of a Buñuel film to tell us whether Buñuel film IS that we may feel all those emotions in a 

 succession of split se­ conds. Movies like that don't (piickly puss from the mind. 
Many horror films are 
New Movies, including the dreadful 
“ The 
Om en." if only because 

 they reijuire audiences to swallow nonsense that they’d reject in the light of day. But people who go to horror films are pre­ pared to make ad ju st­ ments 

F'ellini's “ Casanova'’ is a New M ovie and 
".X m ari'o rd ." which is awash in sentiment of the most appealing kind, is 
Old. There's no doubt about how one is supposed to feel 

 lovi'S It just iH'cause it is schlocky. Th<> other-half goes to see it and loves it 
Itecause it is a slic<‘ of ro m an t ic i/ e d re a l- ljfe . 
The difficulty with the 
New Movie is that we stil! tend to bring to every film the same set ot ex­ pectations and demands we carried with us when we went to see “ (lone

That world seem a perfectly reasonable thing to do, since we’re still sitting in the same old theater seats, looking as the same old (heater screen from the same idd pout of view. Yet we ar- 
(‘11’t always walking ot of the theater with the same old feelings. Something most unsettling is taking place. 
Lack psychology strictly speaking, the 
New Movies aren’t new laiis Buñuel has lieen making them since ITJH,' 
Som etim es, as in “ Un

Andalou” and 
“ 'I'he Discrei't Charm of the Bourgeoisi(‘.” they have been surreal, but quite as fre(jueiitly they’ve been as straight­ forward as “ Tristana.”

United Jewelers and Distributors is unique in that it does not scimp on any aspect of merchandising in order to reduce prices.

Manager Mike Tripp explained that United re­ duces its mark-up to increase volume, enabling it to provide full customer services. 
“We figure we can make as much money on five purchases as most stores can make by selling to two people,’’ he added. This gives the stores increased turnover of goods, making them more up-to-date and increasing the chain’s buying power. 
“Through our 23 stores we are able to buy in mass quantity and pass the savings on to our customers," 
Tripp continued. 
No sacrifices 

“We don’t have to sacrifice personnel, decor or product quality,” Tripp pointed out. “We have the finest name brands in sporting goods, housewares, gifts,, jewelry and silver, cameras, stereo equip­ ment. radios, small appliances and more.’’ 
United is also able to offer such services as charge account.^ and layaway.

 ex to rt ^W.OOO fro nt fmir airlines, and twice elud­ ed the grasp 
FBI agents. 
To day , they ’re still making a liv ing o ff crime 
— far mo re lucrativ e and perfectly legal. They write fo r the telev isio n co p sho ws. 
‘i ’d been a street co p fo r many y ears and I fo und it easy to w rite abo ut p o lice,” said 
Barnes, ‘i had an edge o n o ther writers. I knew the jargo n and the hard­ ware. I knew the day -to - day happenings o f the squad ro o m and patro l cars.” 
Dellinger said, ‘i think hav ing bt.'en in priso n and go tten to kno w hun­ dreds o f criminals y o u realize there is no un­ ifo rm causatio n. Peo ple co mmit crimes fo r v ar­ io us reaso ns. It’s the peo ple aspect that’s impo rtant to me when I write a crime sto ry . I get a go o d picture o f that perso n in my mind. No t the crime.” 
Two men writing fro m ex perience. D ifferent backgro unds, different appro aches. 
Feelings 

Barnes: “ Sure, I put my feelings into my sto ries. My feelings hav e to be biased and slanted to fav o r the po lice. But I also understand that the bad guy s are peo ple. 
Many times they ’re v ery sy mpathetic characters. 
What peo ple are lo o king fo r is a so me happiness, but unfo rtunately so me peo ple like to take sho rt cuts and wind up in tro u­ ble. I do n’t hate crimin­ als, but I do n’t like what they do and I’m no t so ft o n them.” 
Dellinger: “ I’m sy m ­ pathetic to the criminal. I want peo ple to under­ stand them. I want peo ­ ple to see that crime is no t alway s ro o ted in greed. There’s despera­ tio n, lo neliness, bitter­ ness. My biggest co m ­ plaint with TV befo re I started writing was that itglamo rizedthechaseand the capture, but alway s igno red the end result, incarceratio n. If mo re sho ws dealt with the bit­ terness. the alienatio n, the destructiv eness o f the priso n sy stem it wo uld giv e y o ung peo ple fo o d fo r tho ught. The criminal wo rld wo uldn’t be as glamo ro us as it’s made o ut to bt*.” 
Barnes, 3 4 , quit a y ear ago after 11 y ears as a po licem an. He began writing in 1 97 o when be was drafted into co m ­ munity relatio ns fo r two y ears. “ I was o ff the street, wearing smo o th clo thes and o ut o f the m ainstream o f po lice wo rk.” he said. “ To keep in the mainstream and v ent so me frustratio ns I began w riting. 
Ten mo nths later I had a draft o f my first no v el, 
‘See the Wo man.’” 

Ko jak 

In early 1 97 5. “ Ko jak” pro ducer Jack Laird read the bo o k and inv ited 
Barnes to write fo r his sho w. “ With a lo t o f help fro m Jack we labo red thro ugh my first script,” he said. “ It sno wballed after that.” 

Barnes has since writ­ ten fo r 
“ B aretta,” 
“ Po lice Sto ry ,” “ Ser- pico ,” “ Jo e Fo rrester” and “ The Blue Knight.” 
He’s co m pleted two mo re bo o ks, and two o f his three bo o ks are being made into mo v ies. In his last y ear with the po lice he made $7 o,ooo writing and “ it’s a lo t mo re no w. 

“ I had to quit the po lice. What happened was I quickly lo st my identity with the rest o f the tro o ps. I was no lo nger co ncerned with nex t mo nth’s utility bill. 
I didn’t hav e to wo rry abo ut hav ing beer mo n­ ey .” 

Dellinger, 4 o, arriv ed by a different ro ute. “ I was in that upward spiral o f super achiev em ent, co nio rate lifesty le. I was in the adv ertising busi­ ness. then was a publish­ ing co mpany v ice pre­ sident. I made $5o,ooo a y ear and had a ho use in 
Palm Springs. 
“ Then ev ery thing I to uched turned to mud. I go t fired, my marriage bro ke up. I tried to ex to rt 
$8 oo,ooo fro m fo ur air­ lines with a bo mb threat. 
Of co urse, I didn’t hav e a bo mb. I w asn’t that crazy . I escaped fro m the 
FBI tw ice, o nce in a sho o ting and o nce in a ear chase.” 
He wo und up in the federal priso n at T er­ minal Island, just so uth o f Lo s Angeles.

 the forest, it’s probably frightened Patrick Cot­ ton-Top, reacting again. 
But in reality the cry is small, as befits this frail monkey. Patrick and his kin, the cotton-top tamarins, occupy only six one-thousandths of the earth’s surface, not an awful lot to ask. 
Yet their province is shrinking. This year i^a- trick and his nervous, excitable fellows have made it to one of the least distinguished lists in this world, a kind of ‘‘Who 
Almost Isn’t Who,” the 
Red Data Book of Rare and Endangered Species. 
Patrick, if he’s still around, is only ‘25 inches long and 15 inches of that is tail. He weighs less than a pound and a half. 
His offspring are only four inches long, but they are the most important things in his life, the very nature of survival. When one of them dies, whether from a fall or other ad- 
\ersity, an adult might carry the dead infant ar­ ound for hours, a matter of instinct which in humans might be a mat­ ter of love. 
P a l 
Neyman, a 
36-year-old researcher at the 
University of 
California at Berkeley, hopes to get down to the slic e of Colombian forest this summer to look up 
Patrick again, see how he and his cohorts are do­ ing. Not too many people are interested in Patrick, but she is. 
Intrusions 

She’s tagged and ob­ served the cotton-top tamarins for a while now and charted the some­ times skimpy and dwin­ dling forests in which they live. She wonders how many there are and whether they can survive the intrusions of men chopping down trees to farm the land and trapping these wee mon­ keys for zoos and medical research. 
These peculiar little fellows have status in medical laboratories. 
Ten to 14 per cent of them come down natur­ ally with cancer of the colon, and therefore make interesting models for the study of that dis­ ease. 
So the cotton-top is not entirely uesless to man. 
To nature no creature is useless, each forming a part of the wild jigsaw

 puzzle that is the natural environment of the world. Each, toe. is a special reservoir of genes, formed in this combination over time in answer to the special demands of nature. 
This year, more than a dozen creatures were ad­ ded to the list of 294 mammals and 312 birds considered rare and en­ dangered. Others in this class of 197? include the 
Mediterranean mouflon. 

 which is a small \ersion of a wild sheep, the 
Northern bottlenose whale, the Giant Sable 
Antelope, the Argentine 
Pampas deer, (ire vy’s 
Zebra, the Sloth bear, the 
Whilefin dolphin, the 
Irim ole eat and four kinds of flying fox, 
Ms. 
Newman, who prefers that designation, is devoting her attention to the tamarins. They tra\el in groups of three to 13, acting like a family e\en though they might not be. 

Guarding 

They jealously guard their tribal range, which might cover 18 acres filled with trees and 
.shrubs that yield the berries, and fig-like and peaeh-Iike fruit they prefer. They also feed on leaves and other vegeta­ tion. 
To identify the members of groups. Ms. 
Ni'wuian started ulphu- betically with an “ A” group, and gave the first member Aa. That, she decided, wouldn’t do, nor would numbers. So for her own cfinvenienee she gave them names that were compatible w ith her scientific designations. 
Thus. Aaron. 
Barth ­ olomew. Calvin. Darrell, all the way to Xavier. In between somewhere was 
Patrick. 
She saw Patrick carry­ ing a dead infant around for two hours. It is the nature of the male to carry the babies on their loping jaunts through the trees. 
Whatever the 

 tamarins think of other creatures, they are most attentive to their young. 

Even when they are facing off against a threatening intruder, raising the white topknot that gives them their name, they break off the encounter from lime to time to cheek up on the baliit's in the tree where they have left them in sal'ely 

Youth is a fleeting thing among the tamar- ins. At the age of one month the infants can walk around on their clawed feet. At three months they are totally independent. At a year and a half a female can conceive, although not always successfulIv. 

Unsure 

Rarely is the monkey seen by man as other tamarins see thein.selves. riiat small black face, courst'd by white streaks, the long bluck-tipped tail, the white belly fur. the brownish overcoat, are almost always seen by man and other strangers in anger or fear. So unsure of the world is this creature, it is rarely seen in its placid stale. 

U reacts to the hawk overhead and the Tayra. a wi'asel-like creature that stalks the trees in which it lives. Somehow' nature has told the tamarin it is endangered long before man found out.

 brothrs and sisters finishing school. 

” 1 fee! very proud that each of them has developed himself into their own fields — one is a song writer and pub­ lisher in Hollywood, another an insur­ ance executive, one a traveling musi­ cian, and another manages a fast-food service business.” 
He regrets not being able to devote more time to school but the jobs he had did not pay well. “ Nowadays there are even good paying part-time jobs and a lot of financial assistance to go to school.” 
Perez believes in setting goals with alternatives. His goal now is to become a union official in the national level or an economic consultant after earning his masters degree. 
He adds that in order to stay on top you have to have discipline yourself. 

His present position in the union covers approximately members. 
The major office is in Dallas, where he holds workshops and seminars and visits at least once a nn»nth. Perez was instrum ental in starting the “ The 
Malhaiidler Uniom>er.” a bi-monthly publication of Local 311. 

He recommends a career in the pos­ tal service because it not only pays well but it also gives opportunities to service the public. 
Perez has inuinlained his love for sports. 

He is one of the top handball players in the city. He is one of the founders of the “ Diez y Seis Handball ( ’lu b ," wpieh was formed two years ago. 
He is married to the former Jane 
Cerda and they have three ehildren,

.\s thousands of young wo­ men have done for nearly half a century. Kim \eb- lett arrived in New York and headed straight for the Barhi/on Hotel for 
Women. 
” 'riie famous Barbizon vvhi'r«' all the actresses and models staved in the 
19:iUs.” said Miss Neb- lett. “ Th a t’s what at­ tracted me here. The whole history of it ~ Fm a romantic. They earne here as bltle girls and left women. It’s so much a rom antic 
{larl of modeling. 1 want it in my own jiast.” 
(iraee K e lly slaved there and so did the 
MeCiuire sisters. Sevt'ral of the Seven Sisters col­ leges once had clubrooms there. 
S ylvia 
Pla th , the writer, stayed there vvlu'ii she was a Mademoiselle magazine guest editor from Smith ColU'ge and she fielionalized the huiel us the .Amazon iii her book “ The Bell ,Iar.” 
R eferences 
Fo r m any years the hotel had a social direc­ tor. afternoon leas, bridge parlies and organ recitals. Guests were asked to furnish three references. 
“ In those days if a girl pul on her resume ifiat she lived at the Barbizon, that was nearly enough m orally and so cially,” said Margaret Camjjbeil 
Lilland. the hotel’s exe­ cutive housekeeper. 
The HHH-room hotel at 
H3rd Street and Lexing­ ton Avenue opened in 
October 1927. In the 193(ls controlling interest was acquired by M ilton A. 
Kimmelmun and Georgv' 
Zuuderer, real estate in­ vestors. 
A spokesman lor the owners said tlial in re- eenl years the hotel hud been “ languishing” on its reputation. By 1972, the liolel was k*.ss than o() per cent occupied and was losing money. 

Consultant 
David M, Teitelbaum. a m arketing specialist with an itileresl in ri'v i- lulizing old buildings, was hired in latt' 1975 as a eonsuilant. 
.At a time when luxury hotel.'» were 
{jroviding water' bcLls, the Barbizon did not even have a bath with every room. Tele­ vision sets were not pro- vided, but it had u swim m ing pool, organ, music studios and a li­ brary. 

The new m anager. 
Barry S. Mann, said his first impression was of the iobtiy full of heavy, worn furniture, and in the furniture sat several older guests, some in s!ip|)ers and pin curls. 

 riie hotel, like many of tile women who stay there, is in transition. 
Th(' lobby has Ijcen paint­ ed in rich chocolate and van illa eobirs. Heft'r- enees are no longer re- 
(1 Hired. Today, Mann 

 said, the hotel is 89 to 85 
{)er cent tieeupied. 

In the 
18 th-floor lounge, gathered around a color television set, were several young wo­ men who looked like ehet'fleaders. a woman asleep with her knitting needles on her lap and a woman wearing a mink coat, mink hat. a brocade dress, double strand of pearls and diam ond rings. 
Rales 

Bates are S I3 to $22 daily. SB9 to $95 for a 

 week or $249 to $319 monthly. 
Miss Neblett arrived in 

New York from Hieh- mond on Feb. 19, 1979. with $3o9 in cash and gave herself three months to heeonie u suc­ cessful model. She said that last week she made 
S1.999, but for Hie first vear she made only 
SL9H2. 

Most of all she likes the wide variety of ages in the residents. 

” 1 love it." she said.

Son Antonio EXPRE55-NEWS— Sunday May 29 1 977 
Santa Rosa starts drive for children’s regional heart center 

 school's pediatric dentistry depart* education instructors will be offered ment will rotate through the hospital's seminars regarding the design of outpatient clinic to increase their sports activities appropriate for clul- kmnvledge of unique problems pre* dren with heart ailments; sen tod' by children with heart disease 
• Programs will be started to in as it relates to preventive dentistry; crease public awareness of the met to 
• Seminars will be conducted for ods for prevention of cardiovascular parents of children with heart disease, disease as it relates to hypertension, 
® Athletics coaches and physical coronary artery disease and stroke 

If the folks who run the Chil­ dren's Hospital of Santa Rosa 
Medical Center have their way, no child within miles of San 
Antonio will go through life with an undectectcd or untreated heart problem. 

The Children’s Hospital Foundation is conducting a low-key campaign to raise funds to establish a regional heart center for children of South 
Texas. 
Initial goal of the foundation is to raise $5oo,ooo to add staff, equipment and facilities to those already at the hospital located at 519 W. Houston St. 
Technical direction for the facility is coming from Dr. Colette Kohler, dir­ ector of pediatric cardiology since 
1966. 
Dr. Kohler, director of the hospital’s pediatric cardiology unit, says the idea is to intensify efforts to improve the quality of life for school-age young­ sters with heart problems. 
The second floor of the hospital, which has been designated as tin* lo­ cation of the center, will house an up- to-date cardiac catheterization labora­ tory which will make possible “ superb quality invasive diagnostic tech­ niques.’’ according to Dr. Kohler. 
Cost of the laboratory alone is 
$51)o.ooo. 
“ This will be an integral part of the regional center,” Dr. Kohler explains. 
“ Quality care, teaching and research requires top quality equipment.” 
The concept of a regional center is a natural outgrowth of programs that have been in existence at the hospital since 19H7. 
That was the year when San Anton­ io’s first heart catheterization labora­ tory, designed especially for infants and children, was established at The 
Children's Hospital. 
New programs on the planning board include: 
• Resident doctors from the medical 

• Research programs will begin into problems presented by infants born prematurely with respiratory disease and cardiovascular abnormalities. 
The hospital, with its load of patients with difficuit-to-diagnose disease and conditions, is a valuable training laboratory for young doctors specializ­ ing in pediatries. Dr. Kohler asserts.

High Schools serve the area. There is also a school site for a future elementary school cen­ trally located within the 
Hidden Forest communi­ ty. The school is to open in Fall. 1978. 
To maintain the p ri­ vate. secluded nature of 
Hidden Forest, a Ho­ meowners Associât ion adm inisters the com­ munity’s open green ar­ eas. as well as the swim­ ming pool, tennis courts- and recreational areas. 
The recreational faci­ lities are available to all residents of Hidden For­ est. 

Discover Hidden For­ est this weekend whi're you will find luxurious nev\ homes in the rolling, wooded hills of San An­ tonio.

The tradition of Hiddni Valiio is im­ plied in its name alone, t'otton, who in 
HHj‘1 was named “ Builder of the Year” 
1)> the (ireater San Antonio Builders 
Ass«teiation, built homes of many 
\allies which were “ hidden” — or in- 
\isible — to the average buyer of new houses 
Following in the footsteps of Cotton 
IS his son Honnie, who founded Hidden 
Value Homes Corp. in memory and honor of his lather. His corporation is to follow the tradition of hidden values. It is, after all. a proven for­ mula for both the builder and buyer. 
Among these hiilden values are maximal insulation in both walls and ceiling; power ventilators in attics; 
IH-inch on-center stud construction: 

 and strong foundations. 
Values so obvious to the buyers in­ clude handsomely rugged exteriors of 
KHl per cent masonry; wall-to-wall carpeting of 1oo per cent nylon; pro­ fessional. custom decoration; custom designed fireplaces; vaulted and beamed ceilings: step-down living rooms; ceramic tile showers and tubs in baths; stainless steel stoves; and, in kitchens, dishwashers, disposers, vent hoods and ceilings with recessed lighting, 

Hidden Value homes in Tim ber 
Hidge range, in price, from $.‘16.ooo to 
$4r).nOO; in size, from 1,2oo to 1.6oo sip ft. Flans are designed for total living area with no wasted floor space. 

HIDDEN VALUE H O M ES CORP. enters second day of opening for its'Timber Ridge hom es 

Timber Kidge, most easily found off 
Culebra Road north of N.W. Loop 41o, boasts an amenity area encompassing a swimming pool, recreation center and tennis courts. The community is within the Northside School District which has proposed to locate an ele­ 

 mentary school in the neighborhood 
Hidden Value also is building in the nearby Oaks of Timber Ridge. 

The younger .Jaroszewski holds a degree in marketing and has been building houses for a total of nine 

>ears, seven of which he spent with his father and two by himself. 
Timber Ridge is reached most easily by exiting from N.W. Loop 41o to 
Fulebra Road, proceeding outside the 
Loop past Ingram Road until the marked cntranceway can be seen.

"total eommunity” eon- eepl that was th<‘re be­ fore they were. A m e n ­ ities for Twin (Yeek in- elude a clubhouse with fully equipped kitchen, swimming pool; wading pool; tennis courts well ligbti'd at nights, fenced and green-surfaeed; and a complete playground for the neighborhood’s youngsp'rs. 
Allot hiM' factor for 
Twin 
Creek’s rapid growth and im m ediate popularity is the a r e a ’s model hoiiH* park. Fully furnished, professionally decorated models have been on d is p la y here since Twin Creek opened 
Kveti tills weekend six such models are being shown from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
(b'rtainly not to be overlooked, when listing reasons for 'rwin Creek's sueeess, are U.S. Home 
C o r p . ’s g r e a t l y e a s e d te r m s for house p u r ­ chases. 'I’he best financ­ ing available today is of­ fered here, and arrange­ ments include VA loans with only $I a s a total mov(‘-in cost and an aii- uuai interest rate of 8 per cent. Conventional fin­ ancing ti'iTns are advan­ tageous, too 
'I'his liecomes even more convenient when it 
IS apiilit'd to 
Twin 
Creek’s affordable price range, which s t a r t s as low as $:t2.9i)(). 
That prii'c range pre­ sents great b a rgain s in home purcliases, as Twin 
Creek’s models clearly 
IT'VT'Ul. 
Luxury appointm ents of the homes include a choice of sh ag or sculp­ tured nylon earpefing in all bedrooms and formal liMiig and dining areas. 
Two full c e r a m i c tile b aths hav(' m a r b l e d r e s s in g v a n ities with mirrored walls, cabinets, vinyl flooring and <’hoiee of wallcoverings. 
The three- and fi»ur- bedroom home,s. of course, have two baths and tw'o-car garages. All for sale this weekend also hav(‘ 1oo ()cr cent ma-; sonry exteriors us just one e n e r g y - sa v i n g f e a ­ ture 
OthiT fine features of 
Twin Creek homes are handcrafted fireplaces, patios, room-finished g a ­ rages with overhead doors, acc(‘iU paneling and s c u lp tu re d front doors. 

(JthiT U.S. Home fea­ tures that h<‘lp save en­ ergy include full insula­ tion in walls. inehes of insulation in ceilings, over-engineered air conditioning and heat sy s te m s which require minimal usage and doors and windows which shut tightly to make sure the outdoors is locked out. 

Homemakers are over­ joyed with ecdor-coordin- ated kitchens boasting all-eiectric Magic Chef ranges and continuous- clean ovens, disliwasluTs designed for double loads and ample cabinet space. 

I.oeated in the p r e ­ ferred North.side School 
District, Twin Creek is also closiï to

Twin Creek is reached most easily by driving north of N.W. Loop 41o on 
Bandera Koad and turn­ ing west onto G risso m 
Road (FM 471), following signs which lead to the entrance way marked by fountains. More sig n s along the entrance road lead to the community’s model hoiTie park.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sunday May 29 19 77 
Ellison home 
‘posses test’ os among 

John ynd 
Darlene new home on a 24-hour 
Bomben movt'd into their new Ray Ellison home in 
Wildwood last Mareh 3o. 
T h (d r f o u r ■ l>ed roo m. two-bath •• Aurora” has more than 1,4oo sq. ft. of livinj? area. 
Being a sales repre­ sentative for Honeywell 
Inc. throughout South 
Texas. John believes that all claims about product excellence should be made to stand up under scientific scrutiny. Since the 
Ellison 
Energy 
Package was one of the factors influencing his decision t(> j)urchase in 
Wildwood. John decided to see for himself just how efl'octive the energy pai-kage might be. 
Mea sured 
So. John installed a continuous temperature measuring device that recorded the temperature inside his 

 basis. The results, over a four-week period in 
April, provided an eye- opener for John and 
Darlene. Despite outside temperatures consistent­ ly In the 8os during the month, the temperature inside the Bembens’ new home never rose above 
78® during the daytime — without the air condi­ tioning unit being turned on at ail. 

At night, again with no mechanical temperature control in use, tlie inside temperature at the Bem­ bens never dropped below H8® dt'spite outside night temperatures that often dropped to the low 
5os and 4os. 

The real proof of the pudding caiiK* in tlie mail with their .April utility bill. Cliarges for gas and electricity for the four 

 weeks of April totaled exactly $25. 
John and 
Darlene 
Bern ben know that the 
Ellison Energy Trackage is for real. Double-pane windows, power attic ventilator, 1o inches of insulation in ceilings and 
W2 in walls plus special caulking and sealant, along with interlocking thresholds, add up to a dynamic combination designed to deliver en­ ergy economy and dollar savings. 
If you would like to have a grin rather than a grimace on your face when you open your utility bills this .Summer, why not consider the possibilities at 
Wild­ wood? 
Phone or drop by the sales office to s(*e for yourself. 
Don’t let the energy crisis create a financial crisis for your housi'hold budget. 

Wildwood is a special place for special people with its excellent northwestern location off Bandera Road. The new Ray Ellison homes in this desirable location are near key expressways, with easy access to shopping centers, schools and recreational facilities.

POWER SAVER homes modeled by Burns Co. builders 
Burns pi oneered 

 fuel -savi ng home 

While many San An­ tonio builders address themselves to the energy 
- efficient home now, in the face of spiraling uti­ lity costs, the Burns Co., four years ago, began designing homes to re­ duce energy waste within homes. 
And, while many builders are adding extra insulation and double glass windows, the Burns 
Co. set out to tackle the biggest energy - waster of all: air infiltration.

Power Saver II* Model Home at 
B7 o6 Timberwilde in The 
Great Northwest. 

Air infiltration is the unnecessary movement of air into or out of your home. While some air movement occurs in dai­ ly activities like entering or leaving through a door, the overwhelming percentage escapes, or enters, due to loose con­ struction techniques. 
Tests have proven that up to 41 per cent of cooling and heating costs can be attributed to the effects of air infiltration. 
As new air moves into your home, it must be recooled or reheated. 
Eventually, all the air in the room w ill be re­ placed. While one change of air per room each hour is reasonable and some older homes have a rate of four changes of air per hour, the a\era,ge 
Bums Co. home changes air only once every two hours. 
This remarkable de­ crease in infiltration rate is brought about by the extra time and effort that goes into the construc­ tion of a Burns Co. 
“ Power Saver” home. 
Each step of construction includes energy - con­ serving techniques to seal out air infiltration. 
Extra insulation and double glass windows are standard, as are power ventilators. 
Although 9o per cent of the added energy - .sav­ ing techniques are in­ visible in a completed home, the difference they make will be clearly visible on a monthly uti­ lity bill. 
From top to bottom and from inside out, every Burns home is built to meet strict en­ ergy efficiency stan­ dards. While this is a major concern of the 
Burns Co., it never neg­ lects the styling or liva- bility of a home. 
The “ Power Saver” homes collection features exciting options to suit any lifestyle. Handsome living areas, with deep • pile carpeting and furni­ ture - finished paneling, are planned around sun­ ken conversation pits or more traditional plans. 
All include woodburning fireplaces and built - in bookcases, with some models featuring a roil - out TV cabinet, comple­ tely antenna - wired, under the stair landing. 
Spacious master bed­ rooms include separate dressing areas and walk 
- in closets. Built - in alcoved beds with mat­ tresses, drawer space and toy storage are op­ tional in some upstairs children’s bedrooms. 
Extra features are found in the 
“ wife saver” kitchen areas, too. Many become family activity centers, some with updated versions of the breakfast nook popu­ lar in the 2os. The mo­ dern pla n fea tures fouilt - i n sea ting with shelved 
^ pla nt windo ws a nd 
1 niches fo r g reenery . 
TTie Hums Co. invites all prospective home buyers in San Antonio to see the advantages of | 

 owning a “ Power Saver” home. Representatives will be happy to show interested persons homes under construction to point out the power ♦ saving techniques invisi­ ble in a completed home. 
Sales offices are open 
In The Gat Northwest and 
Hidden Forest daily tfrom noon to 6 p.m. 
Burns Co. homes also are available in Royal Ridge.

 home buyer a broad trolled central heating range of life styles, with and air conditioning 

, Families looking to the future and concerned with finding “ that per­ fect house” in ‘‘that per­ fect location” are traveling to Briarwick in northeastern 
San 
Antonio’s vicinity. 
I Briarwick, by Royal 
Crest Homes, is located beyond the reach of the city taxes but still offers the commuter a very 
|hort driving time to 
N.E. Loop 41o via Wet- more Road. 
Most popular 

This prim • location in northeastern 
Bexar 
County, coupled with the excellent educational benefits of the North East 
School District, is prov­ ing Briarwick to be one of the most popular com­ munities of new homes to be introduced in several 
¡^ears. 

 prices that begin at 
$28,5oo and increase, ac­ cordingly, to $43,ooo. 
According to Ed R i­ chardson, young families anxious to own their first home are find the less expensive models well within their financial reach yet packed with standard items often op­ tional “ extras” with other builders. 
Thermostatically-con- 

 deliver an energy-effi­ cient wallop because the units are teamed with an energy packAge designed to cut energy consump­ tion dramatically, whether in the heat of 
Summer or the coldest of 
Winter days. 
Included in the energy package are wall and ceiling insulation that exceeds VA/FHA stan­ dards; turbine roof ven­ tilator; and interlocking thresholds designed to halt infiltration of outside air. Some models even feature double-pane w in­ dows and attractive brick and stone-front fire­ places sure to bring a warm glow to chilly evenings. 
While Briarwick offers a wide variety of attrac­ tive exterior designs, the quality evident on the outside is just as evident on the inside, with top quality, long-lasting ap­ pointments and ap­ pliances. 
Briarwick kitchens are truly splendid, designed for convenience and beauty for the part-time gourmet chef or the full-time housewife in a 

 hurry to prepare family meals after a day at the office. Kitchen tasks are made easier by the built-in Magic Chef un­ dercounter dishwasher. 
Most Briarwick models feature, as standard, the 
Litton combination microwave oven, which gives the chef a choice of either cooking with microwave only or with conventional baking and broiling. A range is atop the facilities. 
Using the two methods in combination offers the best features of each, as microwaves penetrate the food and cook quickly and conventional heat browns in crispness — all in about 1 /2 the time of conventional cooking. 
All in all, Briarwick, by Royal Crest Homes, offers the ultimate in new home features at econ­ omical prices that bring top quality homes well within the reach of the growing family of moderate income. Briar­ wick also offers un­ abashed luxury to those looking for a way to move up to a new life style of country living, with easy access to all northeastern conveniences. 

Marshall Meadows, an established community in the northwestern qua­ drant of Bexar County, will soon be open to the home buying public as 
Ray Ellison’s newest development of new homes. 
Marshall Meadows has ail the advantages of country life, along with many of the conveniences that go with one of the best locations in Bexar 
County; the heart of the northwest. 
Hot, heavy 

Ray Ellison is bringing exciting designs and in­ novative floor plans to 
Marshall Meadows, and the construction is hot and heavy as crews tar­ get their efforts to fin­ ishing new homes for the families already visiting the new community to select their new homesites. 
Beginning this week­ end, 
Ellison sales representatives will be on duty in Marshall 
Meadows to assist the home buyers, even though the first model home and sales office is not fully completed. 
Marshall 
Meadows’ location is of prime im­ portance to the working man or woman who hap­ pens to work at UTS A, or the medical school, or 
USAA, or Datapoint or any of the bustling bu­ sinesses and firms in the northwestern quadrant. 
For those who care about education for their children, schools of the excellent Northside Dis­ trict provide exciting academic and social pro­ grams. Marshall High is w ithin walking distance.

Property tax has a ne­ gative effect upon home owners interested in ex­ tensive rehabilitation of homes, the National 
Association of Realtors observes. Knowing that a rehabilitated home will receive a considerably higher assessed valua­ tion tends to dampen the interest of home owners in making improve­ ments, the association said.

,\r s T l .\ — Lt'KiT-laUon de.siLmt'd to help Bexar ('ount\ ifaehinK h(i>pUai.s with stale iunde has suddenly been eaipilit in a possibly lata! eonferenee eomnutlee bang-up. 
Slate Sen. Chet Brook s of i^isadena 
Saturday passed a motion in the Senate ask ing for a new slate of eonfereiKc eonimiUee menibei's from the House 
Si(i(‘. 
Brook s said the present muk e-up of the eommillee assigned to clear up differences in bis leuebing hospital bill uppurenlly will nut allow the bill to pass out. 
Ifrouk s’ motion for new m em bers niusl be approved by th(‘ House, bul by late Saturday nighl no such approval was evident. 
SBHO by Brook s proposes first-time state funding of the purely education- relalcd costs at seven teaching hospi­ tals in Texas. 
Top priority 

T he B rook s le gisla tion has-b een abeied by the Bexai' t’ounty delegation as one of its most iinporlant priorities. 
The teaching hosp itals in San An­ tonio — m ainly (ire e n and B e xar 
County hospitals — would be two of the p rim ary benefieiuries of B rook s’ le­ gislation. 
Brook s’ bill {lassed the Senate week s ago but am endm ents tagged onto it by ttie House ihrew it into an uneompro- ml^ing eonferenee eommillee of House and Senate members. 
Brook s reporled Saturday that Sen­ ate niemliers of the eom m ittee were ready to ap p rove the bill bul som e 
House m em bers would not give in to certain changes. 

In Its original Senate form , SBfiO proposed funding $1(1 million over the next two ye a rs, p rov id ing at least minimum aid to hospital district tax­ payers. 
Una ble to a ffo rd 

It later becam e evident the legisla­ ture would not be able to afford the funds since other stale priorities began to absorb uvutluble funds over the next two years. 
W hen the bill w as se nt to the 
House changes v\ere made w hicli were not aeeeptable to Brook s. 
One change provided for automatic state funding of teaching hospitals. 
Brook s said this was not agreeable because he wanted the legislature to decide each session the amount of money to go to teaching hospitals. 
U nder the original bill, authority would be given to the State College and 
Universitv ('oordinating Board to con­ tract funds to teaching hospitals. 

Ceiling 

;\nother change placed a ceiling on funding by the House which would 
I'lave amounted to stip ends of $13,o(1o per medical student atlending Univer- silv of Texa^ medical schools. All other medical school students would be pro­ vided $1o.ooo stipends. 
Brook s said this was not agreeable because it is diserim iiiatory to non- 
Cniversity of Texas medical students. 
Sen. Frank Uiimbardino of San An­ tonio. a m e m b e r of the conference conimitlee, said he is still optimistic 
Brook s’ measure will be reported out of committee favorably on Moiidav.

NEW YORK — Ca n ma chines think? Sho uld they ? The co m- puler wo rld is in the midst o f a funda menta l dispute o v er tho se 
Questic.is beca use a n eminent co mputer scientist wro te a V)o o k a rg uing tha t ma chines co uld nev er be ma de to rea so n like peo ple a nd, wha t wa s mo re sho uld no t be. 
Twenkv years age. in the infanev o f the fo nipiiler revo lutio n, befo re pro b­ lems began ennpping up, the puhlir 
\sd s to ld th at e o m p u te rs \vt» u!d be sm arter than bruins. C'o mp\iio r chess playing and machines translatio n, fo r example, were just aro und the co rner. 
$o far, neither has bt'en acco mplishtxi successfully, and neither is likelv to l)e any lim e so o n. 
No r have co mputers had much suc­ cess in making decisio ns that re(juire ju dg m e n t. They can r a ttle o ff the 
M anhattan telepho ne directo ry u n e r­ ringly tim e after time, w hich'no hu­ man can do , but they canno t begin to distinguish o ne face fro m ano ther, as babies can. 
Pro blem co mplex 
C o m p uter s c ie n tists hav e alw ays said. "Giv e us mo re lime. The pro b­ lem is m o re co m p lex th an we tho ught." 
Then o ne o f them, Jo seph VVeizen- baiim, a pro fesso r o f co m puter science at the M assachusett Institute o f Te- elio nulo gy, wro te a bo o k saying the pro ject was fundam entally unso und and dangero us to pursue, partly, he said, because the co m puters’ and hu­ m ans’ ways o f tho ught wo uld always be alien, and because kno w ledge might beco me lim ited to what a co m puter co uld understand. 
The elders o f the artificial intelli­ gence c o m m un ity re a c te d w ith o utrage. E \en tho se who agreed with his premises criticized the bo o k as be­ ing to o harsh in to ne, to o pE» rso nal in its attacks. 
C o m puter jo urn als hav e bristle d o \er the last year with re\iews, co m­ m ents and replies pro vo ke<l by Wei- ze n baum ’s bo o k, "C o m p ute r Po w er and Human Reaso n” 
Co ntro v ersy 
No w the cimtro vi'i’sy has stiilled into the prestigio us publicatio n Scii tiee. in who se pa.ges he w as a Hacked several weeks ago . 
In an article eiiliUed "W hat Co m­ puters Mean fo r Man and So ciety," 
Pro f. Herbert A. Simo n o f the Car- negie-Mello n University in Pittsburgh argued co m puters w ere no m o re o r lc*ss dangero us than any o ther machine o f the industrial revo lutio n. 
Simo n who is o ne o f the leading fi­ g u re s in a rtific ia l in te llig e n c e re search, asserted that W eizenbaum ’s po sitio n was that man was no t subject to natural laws and that kno wledge abo ut m an’s ability to think was dan­ gero us. 
"I have pro no unced heresy and I am a h e re tic .’’ the tw eedy, 54-year-o ld 
Wei/etibaum said in iiis o ffice in Cam- bridg*'. Mass. 
Lo v es ma chinery 

W eizenbaiim , who says he lo v es beautiS'u! machinery, was no t th(‘ first eritie o f artificial inlelligenee, but he 
\\as the first fro m inside the field. 
"VVeizenbaum has as m uch exp er­ ience as alm o st anyo ne in the wo rld with tills subject," o ne o f his o ppo n­ ents, Pro f. Bruce G. B uchanan, ack­ no wledged. "H e is a m uch m o re in­ fo rmed critic than we have ev er had." 
While machines pro \ ide the o stensi­ ble cause o f the debate, it has enco m­ passed so me o f m ankind’s o ldest and newest questio ns: Ho w do we kno w what we kno w *.’ What do es it m ean fo r hum an s to kno w s o m e th in g ? W hat do es it mean fo r co m {inters? What is creati\ ily? Ho w do we think? What are the lim its o f science? What are the limits o f digital co mputers? 
Questio ns 

There are also public po licy ques­ tio ns. fo r the vast majo rity o f wo rk in artificial intelligence is sup|)o iTed by the fe de ra l g o v e rn m e n t th ro u g h agencies like the Defense Department and the 
Natio nal 
Aero nautics and 
Space .Administratio n, with grants es­ timated at $5 millio n a year. Effo rts to g et c o m p u te r s to rea so n inv o lv e between 2o11 and 5oo peo ple in this co untry. 
At Stanfo rd University in Palo Alto . 
Calif., o ne o f a handful o f centers re­ searching artificial intelligence, co m ­ puter scientists co nceded they have no t achieved the m ajo r breakthro ugh o f teaching m achines to think, ra th e r tliaii to simply repeal what they have lieen to ld. 
But they e a g e rly dem o nstrated several pro gram s that, thev said, exhiliited "clev erness." 
The ullim ali' aim o f o ne such pro ­ gram . called MYCIN. is to enable a physician to type in a patient’s sym p­ to ms and test results and get luicK a diagno sis and suggested treatm ent. 
45o rul es 
So far, the maeliine has been taught 
45o rules regarding meningitis, culled fro m m edical Jo urnals and Stanfo rd ho spital case histo ries. It co m p ares patients’ histo ries to tho se rules and has given accurate diagno ses under experimental co nditio ns. 
So metimes the machine will ask fo r mo re info rmatio n abo ut a test o r abo ut the patient, if the given info rmatio n do es no t iulfiil its jiro grum, and will explain to the iihysician why it wants to kno w. It IS also abb* to ('xpkiin flo w it reaches its co nclusio n by telling whieli o f Its rule.s a{){)ly to tlu' given jialienls. 

"Thesi' are pro grams with very nar­ ro w l i m i t s . ’’ said B iuliaituu. who wo rked o n M \’( ' l \ with Dr Jo shua 
Lederbi'i'g. pro lesso r o f geuelies at 
S laiifo rd and 
No bel la u re a te in medicine. "Tliere’.s no widespread in- l(>!Iigenee here. Vet." 
Reto rted 
W eiezenbaum reto rted fro m MIT, 
"My argum ent that it canno t be do ne do es no t rest o n any particular lim ita­ tio n o f co mputers, o r the state o f the' 

 art. o r anything o f that kind It simply rests o n tiie nature o f science," 
Ho w far can science see into an­ ything. particularly m a n ? " he said. 
‘The artificial intelligentsia claim s that the co m puter m etapho r can so - im'ho vv explicate the who le man. This strikes me as being eno rmo usly arro ­ gant and just plain wro ng — wro ng in principle." 
Back at Stanfo rd, L ederberg co un­ tered. ".A ssertio ns abo ut w hat will nev er bo po ssible are no t lo gically lenable, I do n't kno w what's im|)o ssi- l)!e. I preler to wo rk in what is po ssible and try to stx' what we can do ." 
Bra in co mplex 
"Organism s are built (« til o f matter. 
1 can see no place in jn'im iiJf' by which 
1 can believe that a brain can do a co mputatio n that a machine canno t," he said. "A brain is. ho wever, en o r­ mo usly mo re co mplex and dymainical- ly o rganized, built o n vtwy different principles and subject to fo ur billio n years o f evo lutio n. So far w e’re far fnim having a very clear picture o f ho w that is put to gether. T h at’s o ne o f the m ajo r fro ntiers o f bio lo gy at the present tim e.’’ 
One o f the reaso ns why Weizenbaum became skeptical that parallels co uld be drawn between hum an and co m ­ puter tho ught was the reactio n to a 
8o y o uths to tra in in SASD pro g ra m

OF THF EXPRESS NEW S STAFF 
ATHENS, Ga. - Tennis is not like show bu siness and if y ou want the show to go on y ou hav e to get y ou r act together. 
Trinity ’s Tony Giammalv a did ju st that Satu rday afternoon in the NCAA singles q u arterfinals against second-seeded Bru ce 
Manson of USC and later teamed with Larry Gottfried to defeat 
Stanford’s Bill Maze and John Bast, 4-6, 6-4, 7-i) in the dou bles q u arterfinals. 

Before a brief thu nderstorm brou ght back memories of the first fou r day s of the NT A As, all of TU’s singles entries. 
Eriek Iskersky , Ben McKown and 
Giammalv a, were eli­ m inated. 
Bu t t hi rd -seeded Gottfried and G iam m alv a ra l­ lied in the third set to keep one Tiger du et on stage for the Su nday semifinals. 
UCi'UA’s Tony G ra­ ham top p ed Iskersky fi-1. 3-6, fi-3 and top - seeded Matt Mitchell 
RD,,T of Stanford worked 
I ON har(J tn down MCKown 
6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in the third rou nd. Manson had his hands fu ll in defeating Giam­ malv a 6-1, 3-6, 7 -6. The USC All-Amer­ ican won the third set with a. 5-2, tie­ breaker. 
Neither Mitchell or Mu nson had lost a set in the tou rney p rior to p lay ing 
McKown and Giammalv a. 
The u p set bu g retu rned to the cou rts 
Satu rday , with third-seeded Ferdi 
Tay gan of UCLA falling in the third rou nd to North Carolina State’s John 
Sadri 6-3, 6-4. 
Bu t the crowd of 2,5oo was thrilled by the ex citement generated by the 
McKown - Mitchell and Giammalv a - 
Manson matches, 
Mitchell had been blowing his op ­ p onents off the cou rt with big serv es and high-v elocity v olley s throu ghou t the tou rney , u ntil he ran into McKown. 
The cat-like Stanford netter handled 
McKown, whose slower, deliberate sty le p resented a direct contrast to his own, with relativ e ease in the first set. 
Bu t McKown bou nced back to break 
Mitchell’s serv e twice at the beginning of the second to take a 3-o lead. 
McKown’s p recise p assing shots were killing the net-charging Mitchell. 
The Stanford ace backed off the net and p u lled back to, 3-3, before McKown made his own mov e at the net to win the set, 6-4. Mitchell op ened the third set with three aces and ju mp ed ou t to a 
3-o lead. 
McKown came back to, 3-3, and later had break p oint tra iling, 4-3, bu t missed a backhand, p u tting Mitchell ahead, 5-3. It was all ov er then. 
“ He came to the net and I p assed him. said McKown. “ I lost becau se I cou ldn’t hold my serv e. 1 shou ld'v e charged the net more.”

Althou gh I mu st admit it’s nice not to hav e to worry abou t who’s going to reliev e and who’s going to start tomorrow. 
“ Peop le remember the 23 y ears in the majors. What they forget is the 18 y ears I sp ent riding the bu sses in the minors.”

And that, if y ou r math is a little ru sty , adds u p to 41 y ears and more diamonds than most jewelers will ex amine in a lifetime. 
Alston now works for the Dodgers in a v ariety of way s. He liv es 3o miles from Cincinnati so he watches abou t half the Reds games. If a scou ting rep ort is needed, he is close to many N ational Leagu e p orts of call. 
“ If a new p lay er is u p , may be I can tell them (Dodgers) something abou t the way he hits. And v eterane u su ally change the way they hit, too. 
Lea dership 
“ Of cou rse, the way things are going, I don’t think the Dodgers need mu ch help .” Under the new leadership of Tommy Lasorda, Los 
Angeles has p u t the two-tim e champ ion Reds 13 games behind them. 
M eanwhile. Alston has m ade some trip s to watch y ou ng Dodger p rosp ects. That is why he is in San 
Antonio ov er the weekend. He will trav el to Albu q u erq u e, then Los 
Angeles. 
Only two men — John MeGraw and Connie Mack — managed one du b longer than Alston. That is in stark contrast to today ’s most newsworthy manager — Billy Mar­ tin — who, it is said, is so v olatile he can start a fight in an emp ty room.

The Bay lor Bears won both games Satu rday to gain a berth in the champ ionship finals bu t the Tex as Aggies w e re n’t as fortu nate. 

In Arlington, Bay lor su rged from behind with fiv e ru ns in the bottom of the eighth inning on clu tch hitting by 
Mike Czimskey , Fritz Connalty and 
Ken Kolkhorst to whip Miami of Ohio 
12-7 Satu rday night and remain aliv e in an NCAA regional baseball p lay off. 
The stru ggling Bears, who eliminat­ ed New Orleans 7-1 earlier in the day in the Sou th Central baseball tou rnament at Arlington Stadiu m, trailed 3-o and 

6-2 before th e ir hitting m achine cranked u p against six Redskin p itchers. 
Bay lor tied the game with two ru ns in the six th inning and handed Miami its first loss of the tou rnament with the eighth frame ou tbu rst. The two teams will tangle at 2 p .m. Su nday for the right to adv ance to the College World 
Series at Omaha, Neb., Ju ne 1o-17 . 
Bob Bresnen, now 6-3, took the loss for Miami while John Schott, who hadn’t p itched since Ap ril 23, earned his first v ictory of the y ear in relief, 
Bay lor’s game-winning rally started on a dou ble by Bu rl Coker, a sacrifice and an intentional walk. Czimskey singled home one ru n. Connally dou ­ bled in another and Lu ke Prestridge walked to load (he bu ses. 

Leonard Woods walked in the third ru n before Kolkhorst singled in two more. 

In Tu lsa, Okla, Sou thern Illinois p itcher Ricky Keeton, with last inning relief aid from Dewey Robinson, shov ed the Aggies to ju st one loss from ex tinction in the NCAA Midwest Ba­ seball Regionals. 

After Mike H u rdles’s first inning homer, the Aggies did not send a ru n­ ner p ast second base as Keeton only allowed fou r singles the rest of the way . 

Salu ki lead-off hitter Neil Sialla was as effectiv e batting as Keeton was throwing. Sialla p op p ed a solo home ru n in the fifth, smacked a dou ble, 

 scored three ru ns, belted in two more and stole a base. 
A&M (37 -15) p lay s Michigan (31 14), another team ou t on a limb in the dou ble elimination ev ent with one loss,

INDIANAPOLIS — Jim Hu rtu bise, a v eteran p er­ former at the Indianap olis 5oo, said Satu rday he was offered $1,ooo by a m em ber of fellow driv er Salt

Johnson’s two-run shot in the first inning against loser R on Guidry, 3-1, got Chicago started. In the third, Zisk who had three hits, tripled and John­ son doubled him home, making a 3-o. 
Johnson added another R BI double in the eighth. Chicago knocked out 
Guidry in the fourth, scoring four runs, three of them on a bases-loaded double by Zisk.

Of THE EXPRESS-NEWS STAFF 

Trin ity ’s wo men ’s ten n is team is p ay in g th e p rice o f su ccess. 

Lik e th e o ld Bo sto n Celtics an d New Yo rk Yan k ees, Trin ity h as d o min ated its sp o rt in re­ cen t y ears. Th e Tig er lad ies h av e wo n two co n secu tiv e USTA n atio n al titles, th ree in th e last fo u r y ears an d fiv e sin ce th e 
USTA to u rn amen t b eg an in 1968 . 

So now they are expected to win. 
Like the swallows flying to Capistrano, a Trinity tennis championship is a foregone conclusion. 
No More. 
The Southern C alifo rnia Trojans pose a strong threat to the Trinity ferns and only some superior tennis w ill keep the championship streak alive. 
“ It will be difficult,” Trinity se­ cond-year Coach M arilyn Rindfuss ad­ mitted. “ But it is not out of the ques­ tion. I said at the beginning of this year that I would not call us the lop team in the nation. But I also said many things can happen. 
“ Yet. there is no doubt that CSC is 
\ery. very strong.” 
CSC's strength is evidenced in the seedings for the USTA Championships beginning Monday at Arizona State 
University in Tempe. Trojan ladies

The Yale ladies were game against their Texas foes, but there was simply a talent gap that couldn’t be closed. 
Sandy Slap took the featured singles mutch against former TU netter Sue 
Graham 6-4, 6-o; Carrie Fleming, who played superbly, defeal£‘d Eve E llis in just 4o minutes 6-o 6-1 Stacy Bowman erased Karen Feldm an 6-o, 6-1; and 
.-\nn Scroeder downed Celia Moffie 6-3, 
6- 1. 
In doubles, Stap and F le m in g breezed by Graham and Moffie 6-1, 6-1; and Bowman and Schroeder defpaled 
Ellis and Feldman 6-2, 6-1. 
” 1 am ce rta in ly glad we w on,” 
'trinity Coach Marilyn Rindfuss said. 
“ It would have been a big blow against us going into the tournament if we had been beaten today. 
Play ed well 
“ I thought the doubles teams played well and Carrie looked sharped again in singles. I am hopeful this is a sign of what’s to come.” 
■ 
The first set of Stap and Schroeder’s singles matches were really the only items in doubt Saturday. Stap started slowly, missing numerous backhands against Graham. She got up 4-2 in the set, but dropped two straight games before taking command and winning ih e set. 
“ 1 was very tentative.” Stap admit­ ted. “ It was good that we played today. 
I ’m glad 1 got this out of my system. 
Playing a match is so different than practicing.

 forced her into making a few.” 
Slap placed the ball w ell in the second set and had Graham off ba­ lance. Graham scored just eight points in the entire set. 
Schroeder lost the first three games of the first set against Moffie, w ho was hitting the ball with a great deal of pace and p ra ctica lly d rivin g the frecklcd-face TU netter off tiie court. 
But that stopped. Schroeder won 16 straight games, breaking serve five limes. 
“ I wasn’t moving my feet at all,” 
Schroeder said, explaining her early- mutch problems. “ 1 was letting her 
(Moffie) control me. I felt sluggish out there while I was warming up. 
Feeling better 

“ Now, I got to feeling belter in the second set and then 1 let up a little again. I was letting the ball play me in the first few gam es. In the fourth game, I decided I had better take con­ trol or I was going to get beat fast.” 
Fleming, who has had her ups and downs this year, stayed on the upbeat against Ellis. She volleyed well and simply played good, solid tennis. 
“ I was very happy.” Flem ing said. “ I thought my w in last week (she won the singles title in the AIA W regionals in 
Dallas) helped me. I have my confi­ dence back. And it couldn’t come at a better time.” 
Bowman used a steady game to oust 
Feldm an. “ I served p a rtic u la rly well,” Bowman said. “ I was waiting for her to make some mistakes. She did not play very steady.” 
The girls fly to Tempe, Ariz., Sunday morning and begin play Monday in the week-long U STA meet. - -

U n ive rsity, 
R a ttie r 
Uuach Elm er Kosub an­ nounced Saturday. 

Raley, who was named the outstanding athlete at

Raley was also a stan­ do ut fo o tball quarterback for McCo llum, earning all-city and all-district honors last season.

 champ at the UST.A nu'et — and Shtnla 
Mclnerney are the ttip two seeds in the tourney. Diane Desfor, a returning 
All-American, is the fifth seed. 
And USC’s two doubles teams, Grel- ehen Galt-Desfor and Hallquist-Mcl- nerney, are seeded one and two. re­ spectively. 
Sandy Stap. Trinity’s top player, is seeded third in singles and Carrie 
Flem ing is seeded eighth. Both TU netters are All-Americans. Stap was a singles sem ifin alisl last year. The 
Stap-Flcming doubles eombo is seeded fourth. 
Ann Schroeder, a junior, and fresh­ man Stacy Bowm an round out the 
Trinity quartet. Both are playing in their first nationals. 
“ Sandy looks really good.” Rindfuss said, evaluating her troup. “ She has the potential to go all the way. Sh(‘ has tremendous com petitive spirit and plays well under pressure. 
“ Carrie is doing better. She had her ups and downs this year, but her win 

 last weekend in Dallas (Fleming wo n the singles title at the A IA W Regional 
To urnament) gav e her some co nfi­ dence. She, to o . is capable o f go ing ali the way. 
“ .Ann is the mo st improved play er on the team . She is a team -oriented play er and has played good tennis. 
Stacy also is really looking good. This will be her first natio nal co llege ex perience. 
Stap, junior from Deerfield. Ill,, anti member of the last two title teams, is confident tif her sehooLs chaiu-es, hut realizes IvSC’s strength. 
“ Southern Cal has tlie kind of team that we had when I was a freshman 
(1975),’’ Stap said. “ But 1 don’t think their number four player is as strong. 
For sure Trinity can win, but everyone will have to play their liest tennis. 
"Last year, at least on paper, Stan­ ford should have beaten us. But we went out thinking we could win. Then* are at least a half (Io/lmi teams who can win.” 
Flem ing, a sopliomore who lost in the round of 16 singles last year, said 
Trinity must “ take one match at a time.” 
“ We can ’t look beyond anyone.” 
Flem in g said. “ P e rso n a lly , I am feeling very good. I have been working iiard, I think Sandy and I have a good chance in the doufiles. I have good eonfidenee in my doubles.” 
Schroeder. a junior, is also confi­ dent . 
“ 1 have played in big tournaments as a junio r play er.” the freckled-faced gal 

 said. “ But never representing a school I think I know what to expect, however. 1 think we can win, but we must give our best effort 
” A lot depends on the draw and up­ sets. In other words, the breaks I feel some pressure beeansi* everyone ex­ pects us to win. ” 

” 1 am just re ally excited about playing,” Bowman, a freshman from 

Bedford. N.Y.. said of her first na­ tional cham pionship at Trin ity. “ I think we have a really good chance, hut it depends on so many things.” 

Rindfuss, herself a former Trinity netter. understands that‘people expect 
Trinity to win. 
“ It IS nut a win-or-else proposition, though.” she said. “ 1 would love to win, hut it will he tough."

MARSHALL (AP) - 
Two form er M arsh all 
High Sch ool basketball stars sa> th ey were bam­ boozled into signing na­ tional letters of intent to play for New Mexico 
State University . 
Anth ony Burns and 
Rosh ern 
Amie, both 
6-feet-8 , said th ey signi'd letters on May 4 but be­ lieved th ey were only 
Missouri Valley Confer­ ence letters of intent and not national letters. 
A conference letter h as th e effect of eliminating only th e oth er sch ools with in th at conference from signing th at play er. 
Signing a national letter means a play er cannot sign with any oth er four-y ear sch ool. 
“Th ey (th e New Mexi­ co State coach ing staff) told us we could tear up th e letters if we didn’t want to play th e re ,” 
Burns explained. “Now th ey don’t want lo tear it up.”

Amie indicated th at 
.NMSU assistant coach 
Weldon Drew was sup­ posed to be h ere Th urs­ day to talk with th e two but never sh owed up. 
“ Th at cut it sh ort,” 
Amie said. “ He (Drew) called and said h e was willing lo tear up Burns’ letter but not mine. Th ey certainly never told us we were signing a na­ tional letter.” 
Amie h as already signed a South west Con­ ference letter with Texas 
Tech . 
T erry R ich ter, M ar­ sh all High Sch ool coach , said, “ it’s a big m ess righ t now. B urns and 
Amie h ad originally signed th e letters with 
New Mexico State but neith er th ey nor th eir parents were fully aware of th e implications of ex­ actly wh at th ey were signing. 
“ Since th e confusion h as come to ligh t, th e 
New Mexico State coach ­ ing staff h as made no ef- fot to come to Marsh all to attempt to straigh ten out 
Ro dg ers ho lds o n to win

He's managed four teams in eight years. 
.Alston w a.s always the opposite, tho kind of man who did most of his teaching in a soft voice. Perhaps it was a trail he learned while teaching high school for 14 years 
"to make ends meet with my base­ ball salary.” 
During his tenure with the 
Dodgers, he h'd seven National 
League pennant winners, four 
World Uhampionship teams, and seven victorious National League 
,All-Star teams. 
Talent was always plentiful w;ilh the Dodgers. 
"When I started in 1953. 1 inher­ ited a pretty good team.” he says. 
“ There were guys like (R oy) Cam- panella around. Then there was the next group, players like (Sandy) 
Koufax, 
(Don) 
Drysdale and 
(Maury) Wills. 
" And ttuMi th(‘re was that group in 
1974, the (Hon) ( eys, the (Stev) 
Garveys and (Davey) Lopes. So from my standpoint. I ’ve been as­ sociated with three generations of 
Dodgers. 
Uniformity 

■'There's uniformity in this or- gani'zation. We make the double play in San Antonio like we do in 
Tornado wins it 

DALLAS (A P) - Eng­ lish loan player Alan 
Hinton scored the only goal as the Dallas Torna­ do edged the Las \’egas 
(Quicksilvers 1-ii in a 
Nttrih American Soccer 
I.eagiie gaim’ before al­ most '2(1.o11o persons Sa­ turday night. 
The victory, which came in the 78th minute on Hinton’s goal on an assist from rookie Glenn 
Myernick, gave Dallas seven points and a lie for first place in the NASL 
Southern Division with the CQiilcksilv ers. 
Both Dallas and Las 
Vegas boasted a rock-like delense that made it im­ possible for either side to score for most of the game. 
Dallas, now 6-3. made 
24 shots at the Quick­ silvers goal to only 16 by 
Las Vegas, 7-3. 

WALT ALSTON 
Los Angeles. That’s important 
“ .And we’ve always had good scouts who’ve recognized talent. 
It’s a proud organization. It was that way even before 1 got here.” 
"What’s your title now?” he was asked. 
" I don’t have one,” he replied with a smile, perhaps stressing how much fun it is to be highly unofficial in one's capacity. 
“ I always had one-year contracts when I managed, that’s right. It was a mutual thing. I never worried too much about next year. And I never wanted to be someplace I really wasn’t wanted.” 
Perhaps, then, it is not surprising that Walter Alston has grown old with a sense of security. He pos­ sessed that sense all along.

Meyers laid dow n on sacrifice bunt. Following a pop out. .Art Fischetti walked, loading the bases. 
Marv Webb lifted a singU* to center, scoring Farr and Hushde. .Alike Steen came on relief, but immediately balked, forcing in Fischetti with the third run of the inning. 
Alston 
The Dodgers, playing before 1.147 fans, including former L..A. Dodger Manager Walter Alston, added two more runs in the fifth when .Meyers slapped a two-run double down the right fieid line. 
.After Alt'yers' double, StiH>n quieted the Dodger bats. He gave up just three hits and struck out six in ills four and one-third innings of relief. 
Meanwhile, the Drillers just couldn’t get a hit w ith men on base. They left three runners stranded in the second and left single men on base in the third, fifth, sixth and ninth. They left two men on in the seventh and eighth. For the night, Tulsa stranded 12 run­ ners. 
Tulsa did score another run in the seventh when 
.Alamo Heights alum Blair Stouffer opened the inning with a walk, moved to second on a single by- 
Freeman Evans, went to third when Sample walked and scored on a fielder’s choice by Brian Nakamoto. 
Two runs 
Ollar was two for four lor the Dodgers and scored two runs; Farr was one of two -- his homer — and scored three runs. 
In addition to Leonard’s fine unning catch in right center in the fifth, Webb also made a couple of nifty pickups at third. 
The series with Tulsa continues Sunday w ith a 7:3o p.m. game.

BOSTON 
(A P ) 
- 
Left-handed relief pitcher Tom House, a big disappointment since be­ ing acquired from the 
.Atlanta Braves after the 
1975 season, was sold by the Boston R ed Sox Sa­ turday to the Seattle 
Mariners. 
House, who had a 1-o record with a fat 12.91 

 earned run average in eight appearances this year, was shipped to 
Seattle for an undisclosed amount of cash. 

With the sale, the R ed 
Sox filled their 25-man roster by recalling Jack 
Baker from R hode Island of the 
International 
League.

Rams win city crown 

Continued from Page IS 

 for his 12th win, striking out eight and walking four. However, R oosevelt scored off him in the last inning to slop his run of scoreless innings at 28. 
R oosevelt starter Car! Spear threw just eight pitches to four batters and left the game trailing, 3-o. 
Twice 

“ He had beaten them tw ice this year in relief (with another save against 
Marshall), and pitched the best for us 
(he second half of the season,” R oose­ velt Coach Irl . Kincaid explained. 
Spear had won all of R oosevelt’s last five victories. 
R uiz hit Spear’s second pitch of the game over the left-field scoreboard, 
32o feet away. 
Ted Manwaring hit the second pitch to him into center field for his fifth hit in three games, then Terry Salazar 
(• innected with Spear’s first serve to send it over the wall in left, just inside the foui pole 3oo feet distant. Thus after five pitches Spear was three runs behind. 
When Willie Frantzen singled on the third pitch to him, Kincaid brought on 
Gordy Gesseil, who had three scoreless innings of relief against Xarshall in the series. 
W alk 
Gesseil walked Steve Hill, the first man to face him, and when Steve 
Jewasko sacrificed, the R ams had men on second and third with just one out and were ready to break the game open before Gesseil bore down to fan Tietze and get R ick Fades on a grounder to third. 
That started a string of 11 straight batters Gesseil retired before Fades beat out a bmnt in the fourth. 
In the sixth, though, Marshall got to him, too, wken Jewasko cracked a douBle to left-center and Steve Tietze, ripped another homer to left. 
“ Those three runs in the first were just what we were looking for,” said, 
Ivey. "The kids felt they had the best team in the city and that they had so­ mething to prove, 
"R oddy pitched another strong game and did an excellent job and we played good defense. It’s a great thing for our kids, they didn’t let a loss here or there bother them.” 
R uiz said the home run, "was the first one of my career. It was a fastball right down the middle and felt good. It started getting everybody pumped up and we got four hits in a rov.” 
First 
Tietze also hit his career first on "a let up. We felt like we had to take it to them in that first inning and it stunned them a little bit.”

"R oosevelt battled all the way, they never gave up.” Ivey pointed out. 
The R ough R iders finally got to W’il- lis on their final opportunity. 
With one out, Joe Xoon walked and 
James Fanes and Phil Imbody singled to make it 5-1, but Wiliis then ende(l it on two strikeouts. 
Willis had been the hottest pitcher in five years in these parts in the late regular-season and playoffs. Tom 
Bepko of Churchill had 34 straight ecoreless innings in 1972 
) 
Greg Adkins of Eoosevelt led off the game with a double on the right-field line, but W'illis scooped up Ed Klein- felder’s squeeze attempt and under­ handed it to Frantzen to get Adkins. 
That was the only hit he allowed until the sevent 
Since R oosevelt loses only four starters by graduation and Marshall has just four starters coming back, the 
R ough R iders are in the same position the R ams were a year ago — a year away.

SPEDAI TO THE EXPEESS NEWS 

UVALD E - For the third week in a row in the state playoffs, the Uvalde 
Coyotes will open a series at home when the Gre- gory-Portland Wildcats come west at 8 p.m. 
Tuesday to open the 
Class AAA Region IV finals. 
The second and third games will be played in a doubleheader, if needed, starting at 5 p.m. Friday in the Corpus Christi ar­ ea. 
Site of the Corpus 

 games is undecided, de­ pending on the outcome of 
Corpus 
Christi 
Carroll’s AAAA series with Victoria Stroman. If 
Carroll loses, the games will be at Cabaniss Field; if Carroll wins, they will be at Gregory-Portland 
High School. 
Uvalde Coach Danny 
Matocha has tabbed jun­ ior right-hander Vann 
McElroy (9-1) to pitch the opening game, but is undecided on the rotation for the rest of the series.

 start in each of the last two weeks, beating 
Pleasanton, 3-1, in the 
District 13-AAA opener, then stopping Wharton, 
6-4, last week to get the bidistrict round under way. 
In assessing Uvalde’s victory in three games over Wharton, Coach 
Danny Matocha said, 
“ Our hitting was pretty good.” The Pack explod­ ed for a six-run third in­ ning to win the final game, 9-3. 
Hitter 
"Rambie has really come along as a hitter,” 
Matocha said of Coyote left fielder Steve, who had five hits in a closing doubleheader (Uvalde lost the opener, also by 
9-3). M cElroy had two hits in the six-run in­ ning. 
“ In the first game, 
Wharton took advantage of Neutze ( Catcher Tad) but in the first game of the doubleheader, he threw out two guys at se­ cond and another one at third and they didn’t run on him in the last one. 
"Richard 
Contreras, who we consider our stopper, showed a tre­ mendous amount of com­ petitiveness in the last game (Six-hitter). He’s not an overpowering type of pitcher but has good control.” Matocha said of the left-hander. 
Winner of this series advances as one of the four teams to the state tournament. 

^Must’ time for Blazers 

PO RTLAN D , 
Ore. 
(A P) — Can the Portland 
Trail Blazers come back? 
. “ We’re down 2-o, but that doesn’t mean the series is over,’’ said 
Portland Coach Jack 
Ramsay, who hopes his club will start its come­ back with a victory over the Philadelphia 7^rs in 
Sunday’s third game of the best-of-seven Nation­ al Basketball Association championship series. 
The game will be na­ tionally televised by CBS starting at 2:3o p.m., 
CDT. 
The Portland players aren’t quite ready to give up. 
“ We are a long way from dead,’’ declared forward Maurice Lucas. 
“ We won’t lose our con­ fidence,’’ promised guard Herm G illiam . 
“ Obviously we have to play better, and this is too great a team not to do that,” 

 straight from the multi-talented Sixers. 
To win, Portland will have to get its offense untracked. 
And that means three things. 
First, the Blazers have

 to get their running game going. “ We’ve been able to control their fast break, which has taken away one of their big weapons,’’ said Sixers 
Coach Gene Shue. The 
Blazers need that weapon back in order to win. 
Second, when Portland has to set up, it must be able to score on its back-door and give-and- go plays, where center 
Bill Walton gets the ball and feeds it to players cutting to the basket for layups. 
Third, the Blazers have to cut down on their tur­ novers, 63 in the first two games. 
“ We’re running an in­ effective offense and we’re turning the ball over,’’ said Ramsay, summing it all up. 
“ That’s why we’re los­ ing.”

LAS VEGAS (A P) — Heavyweight contender 
Earnie Shavers thinks his big punch will be enough to take the world championship away from 
35-year-old Muhammad Ali. 
The 31-year-old slugger, appearing at a news conference to announce that he will get a title shot at 
Ali on Sept. 17 in New York’s Madison Square 
Garden, said he thinks the champion’s skills are fading fast. 
The Garden has claimed an Ali-Shavers fight but 
Top Rank, Inc.. announced Friday it had Shavers under contract for such a fight but had not signed 
Ali. 
“ I wouldn’t say Ali is over the hill,” Shavers said. 
“ He is still a very smart guy in the ring. I can’t underestimate him, but he has slipped a little.” 
Manager Joseph “ Blackie” Gennaro was more confident than the fighter. 

Help 
The move from Phila­ delphia, where the Sixers posted 1o7-1o1 and 1o7-89 victories, to Portland’s 
Coliseum should help the 
Blazers, who have won their last six playoff games at home. 
“ The series started with them having the home-court advantage, and they kept it, that’s all,” said Blazers’ guard 
Lionel Hollins. “ Now we’re going to be at home.” 
“ We have upheld our homecourt advantage so far, but now it swings to them,” said Philadelphia superstar Julius Erving. 
“ I ’m sure they’ll be tougher on their home floor.” 
To win, says Ramsay, the Blazers have to play their game. 
“ They scored 
1o7 points against us,” ob­ served Ramsay, “ and we can do better than that. 
We have just got to play our game. I’m not wor­ ried about what they do; if we play our game, we can win.” 
Portland averaged 
111.7 points per game during the regular sea­ son, third highest in the 
NBA, but hasn’t approached that figure in the two playoff games against the Sixers. 
“ Philadelphia is play­ ing very well and some of our troubles have to be attributed to that.” said 
Ramsay. Adds assistant coach Jack McKinney, “ I would say it was about 
5o-5o between our mis­ takes and their good play that put us where we are in this series.” 
Where the Blazers are is against the wall. They must win Sunday, or else face the next-to-impossi- ble task of taking four

Coaches set plans for all-star cagers 

Poge‘9-S 

MIKE GARNER 
. . . new roach 
Central acquires 
Garner 

Mike Garner was named as the new head football coach at Central Catholic 
Saturday. 
Pat Lindelow, who was with Garner on the Alamo Heights staff last fall, was named first assistant. 
The two began their association as opposing players in high school in the mid ‘6os, Garner for Shawnee Mission 
East (Kan.) and Lindelow at Kansas 
City Washington. 
Air Force 
Garner played collegiate football and baseball at the Air Force Academy and 
Duke and played four years of pro ball with the New York Je ts, Winnipeg 
Blue Bombers and San Antonio Toros. 
He was an assistant at Trinity from 
1973-75, handling both lines, lin e­ backers, offensive receivers and spe­ cial teams, then was defensive line coach last year at Alamo Heights. 
Lindelow will be offensive coordina­ tor at Central. 
Alamo Heights 
Prior to coaching at Alamo Heights, where he had the offensive line, he served two years each as an assistant at Las Cruces Mayfield (N. M .) and 
Brownsville Hanna. 
He was also a graduate assistant coach at New Mexico Highlands, where he played three years after playing at the University of Kansas as a fresh­ man. He started at offensive tackle all four years and the teams he played for lost a total of four games. 
The whole Ceptral staff is changing over and Garner said he would hire, at least “ two more coaches to handle the secondary, offensive receivers and backs and the junior varsity.“ 
The Buttons lost 24 seniors and will return six startets and eight other let- termen. They open Sept. 2 at San An­ gelo Lake View, then have their home opener Sept. 1o against Laredo Martin at Harlandale Memorial Stadium. 

By H ARRY PAG E 
Of TH| IXPSS-NfW*. ST*« 
Ed Messbarger of St. M ary’s and 
Pete Murphy of Trinity are beginning to map out their separate strategies for the first annual San Antonio Schoolboy 
North-South All-Star Basketball game. 
The game is set for 7..3o p.m F'ridav at Sams Center Gym at Trinity. 
‘Tve got (Gilbert) Salinas, but the 
North has got the size,“ Messbarger said “ They've got (Charles) Bean, 
(Abe) Davis. (Chuck) Stanley, and 
(Ralton) Way. So. I think we’re going to have to run some, but, we’re going to have to control what is going on on the floor or we’re in trouble.” 
“ The South has real good guards in 
(Fred d y) Medina and (R ic k ) Leg­ gett,“ Murphy poised out. “ I think it’ll all boil down to who can play the best defense. We’re strong inside but the South is tough out front “ 
Join in g Salinas of Burbank on 
Messbarger’s South team are team mate Ernest Puente, Medina of Lanier, 
Leggett of Kennedy, Mike Flores of 
South San Antonio, Aroid Neal of 
Wheatley, Bernard Turk of'Highlands. 
Larry G arry of M em orial, Eddie 
Hodges of St. Gerard’s and David Pol lock of St. Gerard’s- 
Aside from Bean and Davis of Hous ton. Way of Jay, and Stanley of Lee, 
M urphy’s North squad w ill be bol­ stered by Je ff Brown of Lee. Mark 
Tompkins of Roosevelt, Tom Hegemier of Churchill, Stacy Bowers of Judson, 
Blair Jackson of Alamo Heights and 
Mike Holub of MacArthur. 
The game is for graduating seniors 
“ My first impression is that we’ve got to control the game,” Messbarger said. “ I think we’ve got bett«>r guards possibly—Medina and 
Leggett are good fastbreak players. It may prove out wrong, but I think we might be a little quicker. I don’t know.” 
“ I think we’ll go with the one-guard offense because of the people inside.” 
Murphy said. “ My only problem is getting ‘em all together because Bean is going to miss practice because of an all-star game in Oakland We’ve got to get organized defensively to stop Sa­ linas and those guys.” 
Practice for the all-star game be­ gins Wednesday morning at Sams 
Wadkins in lead 

ATLANTA (A P) — Lanny Wadkins. twice a runner-up this season but a non-winner since 1973, one-putted 1o times on his way to a seven-under-par 
65 that provided him with a one-stroke lead Saturday in the third round of the 
Atlanta Classic golf tournament. 
“ I feel like I played awful good today. I made some ropes (extremely long putts) out there,” said Wadkins, whose younger brother Bobby chal­ lenged through three rounds of last week’s Memorial Tournament. 
Wadkins’ effort, the best of the weather-plagued tournament, gave him a 54-hole total of 2o5, 1o under par on the hilly, 6,683-yard Atlanta Country 
Club course. 
Defending champion Hale Irw in holed out from a greenside bunker for an eagle three on the final hole, draw­ ing a huge roar from the big gallery that divided its attention between the players and the black, threatening clouds and rumbling thunder.

AUSTIN — A refu rnishing p lan and bu dget has been ap p rov ed by the Tex as 
Parks and Wildlife Commission for the p u rchase of fu rnishings at the Land­ mark Inn State Historic Site in Cas- trov ille. 
The 19th centu ry inn was donated to the state in 1974 by Miss Ru th Lawler. 
The Parks and Wildlife Dep artment staff has negotiated with Miss Lawler to bu y nu merou s items of fu rnitu re for refu rnishing eight gu est rooms, the office and lou nge. 
Landma|'k Inn had its beginnings in 
18 48 , soon, after the fou nding of Cas- trov ille. The p lace became a rest stop for trav elers on the bu sy rou te between 
Mex ico and San Antonio. 
In 1972, the Landmark Inn comp lex was entered in the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
At p resent the inn is closed to the p u blic while restoration work is being done.

Bo b Ha rris a liv e a nd well in S.A. 

Old bowlers don’t fade away, they ju st mellow with age. 
At least, that is the case of Bob Harris . 
The 56-year old local Hall of Famer let the you ngsters know that an old veteran can still stroke by captu ring the city’s Class A handicap title with a 2,o44 total. 
“ rn i really happy abou t it,” the jovial gentleman said. “I ju st didn’t expect to win the doggone thing.” 

Harris had 558 in the team event, 6.37 in singles, and 586 in dou bles, plu s 26,3 pins handicap, to win his title. 
‘i wou ld have liked to win .scratch,” 
Harris said. ‘‘I’ve never been over­ whelmed with handicaps, or receiving handicaps. Bu t, that’s the way the lo­ cal association has to operate its lou r- u ameni. I gu ess you ’ve got to have handicap so regu lar bowlers can com­ pete against the 2oo-plu s bowlers.” 
Winning titles isn’t anything strange to Harris. 
“ I won the city title long, long time ago,” Harris explains. ‘‘In fact, I won it two years in a row—back in ’55.’56 and ’56-’57. I think that’s right— ‘It has been so long back (smile), ihose titles were scratch.” 
Harris was indu cted into the local 
Hall of Fame in 1972. He carried a ‘2oo average back in the fifties, and won the state match-game titie in ’57. He has ju st received a patch for participating in his 25tli American Bow ling Congress tou rnament, held at Reno, Nevada. 
“There wasn’t near as many good bowlers back then as there are now,” 
Harris continu ed. “The you ng fellows today pu t you to the task. The city has got some good you ng bowlers coming u p. In fact, there are plenty of good ones now.” 
Last year, H arris finished the 
Traveling Leagu e with a 186 average. 
Cu rrently. Bob is hitting arou nd 196 in two different leagu es. 
“ Lm bowling more now,” Harris said. “ I lost my wife 2^2 .vears ago — I ffever cared abou t going back to the 
,^m e after that. I got bu sy doing other 
Eoings. My bowling was lou sy and I 
^ “gan to get discou raged. 
“ "Eventu ally. I had to make u p my mind to do one thing or the other — either bowl more and get my game back together, or ju st give u p. I de­ cided to get my game back and get in more leagu es. My ou tlook on the game has improved now and my attitu de is lx‘tter. 
“Oh, I’m real happy abou t winning the handicap title,” Harris said. “ It was nice. It's ju st to let some of the you ng folks know that we’re still ar­ ou nd.” 
Kirst wins LATA 
Kath y K irst didn’t take long to let 
Iht peers know- that she is really ‘for real.’ 
The 17-year old sou thpaw pheno­ menon celebrated her joining the Wo­ men’s International Bowling Congress by winning the |.adies Amateu r Tou r- i^iment .Association event last weekend at San Pedro. 
^The Marshall gradu ate, who had ju st signed the WIBC papers three days before the tou rney, picked u p $1oo for her efforts. 
"I think it’s pretty good,” Kathy said. “I ju st wanted to make the finals, leou ldn’t believe it when I was the top qu alifier and, then, I won it. It really blevv my mind.” 
, Ironically, one of Kathy’s two losses in the finals was to her mother, lefth­ ander Debbie Kirst, 214-188. The other was to La urie Sca les, 2o5-181, in the first game in the finals. 
Kathv had games of 181, 248, ‘237,234, 
216, W8, ‘263, ‘223, ‘238, and 192 in the finals for a sterling 2‘22 average. 
“ I knew I was going to get ou t of the ju nior program when I got ou t of high 
Stdiool and when my ju nior leagu es finished.” said Kathy, who set several 
AJBC records and who recently re­ ceived the .Alberta E. Crowe “Star of 
Tomorrow” Award. “ The LATA was the first tou rnament in line so I decid­ ed to try it. 
"I was real nervou s the first game — 
I had a 137 game. Bu t. I settled down after that. I had to concentrate more in this tou rnament. As a ju nior, you ’re more relaxed — it’s a little different in the WIBC. Everyone was real nice to me. bu t the ladies are more seriou s. 
“The $1oo’.’ I’m going to stick in the bank and start a bowling accou nt. My plans right now are to keep bowling tou rnaments and in whatever comes u p.

By HARRY PAGE 
Of THE EX9RESS-NEWS STAFF 
April showers pu t a damper on the entries in the 45th annu al San An­ tonio 
W omen’s 
City 
A m ateu r Golf Tou rn a­ m ent, to be held 
Wednesday throu gh Fri­ day at the Olmos Basin 
Cou rse. 
“A lot of the local wo­ men bowiers are involved in several clu b tou rn a­ ments, that were rained ou t in April,” said Magee 
Devine of the San Antonio 
WYu nen’s Golf Associa­ tion, which is co-spon­ soring the event with the 
City Parks & Recreation 
D epartm en t. 
“ There isn’t enou gh time lapsed between the clu b tou rna­ ments and the city-wide event. Playing everyday can get one weary.” 
The city tou rn am en t, has 55 entries this year,' far below the 9 5 entries last year. 
“ The bad weather in 
.April forced most of the clu bs to play last week,” 
Ms. Devine added. “As a m atter of fact, the San 
Antonio Cou ntry Clu b and W indcrest ju st fin­ ished their clu b cham ­ pionships.” 
Bu t there is still hope.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, 
Va. 
(AP) —■ Eamon 
McEneaney scored three goals and assisted on five others as Cornell’s Big 
Red retained its NCAA 
University Division la­ crosse championship “Sa­ tu rday with a 16-8 con­ qu est over Johns Hop­ kins. 

“Althou gh we have al­ ready had ou r deadline, . 
SAWGA will be takin g late en tries u p u ntil 8 a.m. W ednesday.” Ms. 
Devine notes. “ So, the women, who still want to participate in the tou rna­ ment. can still get into the event. 

“ Anyone that en ters the tou rnament can play all three days. In the past, we have had qu ali­ fying rou nds to get the field down and into flights. This year, we feel that isn’t necessary.” 

Cha mpio ns 

The presen t field in ­ clu des fou r former city cham pions, Carol B ar­ re tt, Dodie Su llivan , 
Nancy Meeks and Allison 
Gentle. Debbie Skelly, who finished second to fou r-time winner Brenda 

Goldsmith last year, and sister, Pam, arc entered. 
“We shou ld have a co­ lorfu l cham pion ship flight,” Ms. Devine con­ tinu ed. “ Carol B arrett ju st won the SACC title and Dodie Su llivan won the Lackland title. Alii-, son won last year’s Mi­ litary Dependents tou r­ nament. 
We will have variou s winners from local clu bs entered. 
“We’re also hoping to get Brenda back, if she retu rns from Florida in time. We’ve got an over­ all good field, no qu estion abou t it. 
“ We feel that the entries cou ld swell by . 
Wednesday — only time will tell,” Ms. Devine noted. 

Pairin gs for the tou r­ nament are schedu led to be released Tu esday, 

Irene Wright of SAWGA is the tou rnament chair­ man. 

The ()ne thing SAWGA of th(‘ tou rnament itself hopes is that tlu ' rain s as they did with the don’t dampen the spirits entries.

Leg-puller cures 
/Ululiammatl A ll of his arthritis 
A PERSON could get hurt try ing to p ull Muhammaa AÜ’s leg. But for Richard Minarik it has p aid off handsomely . 
Minarik is a foot reflex ologist who say s bodily ills can be ctired by mani|Hilating tte feet. 
Last y ear THE STAR p ublished a story about him curing Jackie 
Kennedy Onassis (rf a p ain in her neck. 
Ali read the story and p romp tly contacted Minarik say ing that te had p ainful arthritis in nis neck which failed to resp ond to cix iven- tional treatment. 
After only two sessior^ of Mina- rik’s foot manip ulation the teavy - wei^t champ ion rep orted a 1oo p ercent imp rovement. 
“He kq)t reciting p oetry to me while I was worlung on him,” said Minarik. “They were all lü s own p oems — one was called ‘The 
Feet’. ” 
And now Minarik is treating Ali for arthritis in his right hand. 
Ali has even flown the (kictor from New York to Miannd for sev­ eral of the sessions. 
“I have also taught him how to relax before fights,” said Mina­ rik, who runs the Elmshurt Yoga 
Institute in Queens, New Yore. 
“Ali told me that nex t to him, I’m the greatest.” 
Minarik admits his treatment is not recognized by the medical p rofession. But that does not p ré­ voit him from p racticing it. 
He took up the treatment at age 
17 when a foot reflex ologist cured him (tf crif^ling arthritis. 
“I’ve been a cx Hivert ever since,” he added.

MURDERED heiress Ma rjo rie J a ckso n, who kept millio ns o f do lla rs sta shed in g a rba g e ca ns, ta ckle bo x es a nd suitca ses a t her cluttered 1o-ro o m ho me, wa s co n­ v inced tha t, a ll the cro o ks in the wo rld were a fter her. 
Authorities say she trusted no one, not even p lice. Ste was robbed at least four times be- tweai early 1976 ^ d May 1977, once of more than $817,ooo. But she refused to rep ort the crimes or help p rosecute the susp ects. 
Mrs. Jackson, 66, of Indianap olis, Ind., was found shot dead in ter home after it caught fire last rtionth. More than $5 million was md- dai throughout the house. Millions more were 
(Tobably .taken by the tht^s who killed her. 
Detectives:say Mrs. Jackson was a reclu­ sive eccerttric who was fanatical about her re­ ligious beliefk. aie threw, birthday p arties for God, Jesus and the Angels, c<» np iete with p resents and elaborately decorated cakes bearing such in­ scrip tions as:* “To Jesus Christ from Marjor­ ie.” 
■ •. 
She had nte had ter lawn mowed for the p ast sev ^-y ears, since the teath of her hus­ band in 197o, because she said God told her not to. . . • 
But neighbors, acquaintances and the p olice told THR.STAR ste may have let the grass grow and .garbage p ile up in hop es of corivinc- mg tte criminals ime feared that no one lived in tte house: 
“She was "afraid of being robbed and ste talked to ,every (Mie about it,” said Mandell 
Richards, a .deUvery man for a sup ermarket where she often shop p ed.

 went to a Cadillac dealer and biMight two 1977 models with a check for $3o,ooo, telling salesman 
Bob Boone she needed the second car as a back-up . 
Dr. Aaron Balthazar, who stud­ ied her p eculiar behavior, said ste was ap p arently the victim of a deep , overp owering loneliness. 
“The death of ter husband was such a traumatic blow that ste ap p arently came to distrust every one,” he said. “Ste was very close to him and they ap ­ p eared to have been very reli­ gious p eop le. 
“Her sense of loneliness and al­ ienation started in early childhood when her real father died and her mother remarried. Tte only time she seemed to have op ened a gate was with her husband. But death closed that gate aice and for all.” 
Dr. Balthazar, who is often called as an ex p ert witness in san­ ity hearings and was even con­ sulted in the Patty Hearst case, said Mrs. Jackson’s natural re­ serve and distrust were strength­ ened in 1975 when an Indianap olis banker embezzled about $7oo,ooo from cHie of ter trust funds. 
After that ex p erience, she de­ cided banks were unsafe. ¡Sie be­ gan withdrawing money from a number of them and started stashing it throughout her sp rawl­ ing ranch-sty le nome. TTie total amount of her withdrawals was about $8 million. 
TTie inheritance from her hus- baml, tte son of a grocery store magnate and descendent ot Presi­ dent Andrew Jackson, was esti­ mated at between $2o million and 
$25 million. 
But the last few day s of Mrs. 
Jack« )n’s life were ap p arently sp end in terror, authoriti^ say . 
Sgt. Harold Young of the Mar­ ion County Sheriff’s Dep artment said that just a few hours before her death, she confided to a bak­ ery store clerk that someone was out to get her.” 
Young quoted the clerk as say ­ ing: “Sie said she was living in fear for her life — someone was try ing to kill her.” 
Young said she gave the clerk the name of a man who p olice are now holding in connection with the murder. 
ITiere is some evidence tte ar­ rested man “m i^t have been ex ­ torting money from her by threat­ ening her life,” Young said. 
TTie susp ect is one of several p eop le imp licated in the killing. 

She hel d parti es and gave gi fts to God, 
Jesus and the Angel s 

 had a lot of money in that house. But she was really a very nice woman. Very friendly , even if she did act funny sometimes.” 
Mrs. Jackson rarely ventured bey ond the iron gates of her estate, ex cep t to buy grocer­ ies. 
S^e often p urchased up to $2oo worth of food at a time. Once she ordered 15o cans of coffee, 5o loaves of bread and 2» o dozen codcies. talked about God and Jesus as thou^ they were close and p ersonal friends,” said 
Mrs. Rose Lawson, a rwighbor. “They weren’t just sp irits in heaven to her. They were as real to her as my hus­ band and children are to me.” 
Among the thousands of ornate­ ly wrap p ed gifts found in the 
Jackson home were many ap p ar- aitly intended for God, Jesus and the Angels. 
A table in the house was set for 
12 p eop le, comp lete with p lates, silverware and food. A huge cake in the center of the table was in­ scribed: “To God from Marjor­ ie.” 
One gift found near the table, addressed to Jesus, was un­ wrap p ed by p olice. It contained a dozen wasncioths. 
A month before Mrs. Jackson’s death, officials say she called a local service station to tow her vintage 1955 Cadillac after it be­ gan smoking. 
Ste told driver Tommy Gibson that someone had tamp ered with tte vdiicle in an attemp t to kill her. 
But after insp ecting the car, 
Gibson told her that the only thing wrong was that it had a loose wa­ ter hose. 
“Sie wouldn’t listen,” Gibson said, “aie just told me to take it away . 1 asked her where and she said she didn’t care. 
“Then ste said, ‘You can have it. I don’t want it.’ I tried to tell ter that a car like that was worth a lot (rf money . Sie started acting mad and y elled at me to just take it away .” 
Gibson still has the Cadillac, worth about .$25,ooo, p arked near the service station where he works. He can’t sell or drive it be­ cause Mrs. Jackson didn’t give him the title. That same day , she

THE STAR abou t this tou chin g story of frien dship an d lov e: 
I JUST hav e to tell someon e abou t a pretty silv er-haired poodle that came to ou r hou se when ou r on ly son wen t off to war in Vietn am. 
We decided to see ou r son off in a way that wou ld n ot embarrass him with fiis frien ds. 

I said, “Come home, son ,” when 1 pu t my arms arou n d him. He said. “I will. Mother 
He had alway s called me “Moms,” so this mov ed me to tears. His father offered to shake han ds, bu t in stead ou r son hu gged an d kissed him goodby e. 

The n ex t day , between tears an d try in g to do my hou sework, I heard a scratchin g at the fron t door. I open ed the door an d there was a beau tifu l silv er-haired poodle 

I tried repeatedly to make him go away , bu t he stu bborn ly refu sed to leav e. I Itn ew some- 
<Mie wou ld miss a pretty dog like him, so— with tears still in my ey es from ou r son ’s leav in g—I can v assed the n eighbortiood. I cou ld n ot fin d the own er. 

The n ex t day I called the sheriff to report a lost poodle. The police told me n o calls had come in for su ch a (tog. 

We n amed him “Tu ffy ” becau ^ he was so brav e an d n ot afraid of an y thin g. Ev en larger dogs in the n eighborhood gav e him a wide berth. We took Tu ffy ev ery where. He was like a su l^itu te son . 
Ou r real son fin ally ccwn pleted his tou r in Vietn am an d was to be discharged. We prepared to g p an d biin g ou r son home an d 1m n ew wife he met in the serv ice 

After a short stay with u s, ou r son an d his wife mov ed in to a home of their own . 

Tu ffy still wen t ev ery where with u s. On e day we were ou t let­ tin g him ru n . After abou t 1o min ­ u tes we called him as we alwa^ did, bu t Tu ffy didn ’t come. We n ev er fou n d Tu ffy again .

Why Princess Caroline kissed off Prince Charl es 

By ROBIN LEACH 

ENGLAND’S Prin ce Ch arles tried fo r six mo n th s to win a d ate with Prin cess Caro lirK o f 
Mo n aco . Bu t th e fairy tale rwn an ce was a ro y al flq p , clo se frien d s to ld THE STAR th is week . 

Charles was snubbed by Caro ­ line thro ugho ut their two day s to gether in Mo naco — and as so <m as he left fo r Britain, she flew straight back into the arms o f her bo y friend, Frerwh play bo y Mii- liwe Juno t. 

Careful planning by bo th their families was shattered at the ro y ­ al co uple’s first meeting, at a glit­ tering dinner at the lux urio us Ho ­ tel de Paris. Guests said Caro line sho wed up late — hav ing left Jun­ o t in Paris o nly ho urs earlier — and v irtually igno red Charles all ev ening. 

On their seco nd date, o bserv ers said the tensio n between the two was o bv io us. They chatted o nly briefly and held hands o nce — when the band play ed Auld Lang 
Sy ne. 

Once when Caro line left her table, she to ld a guest: “ We’U bo th be happier when he go es back to Lo ndo n and I go tmck to 
Paris.” 

A British diplo mat smnmed up the disastro us attempt at ro y al matchmaking with the tart o bser­ v atio n: “ Itiis is o ne case where the Princess preferred a Fro g to her Prince.” 

Ano ther guest said o f o ne o f the functio ns: “ Cardine was po lite, lauriiing and jddng when Charles ma& a funny speech — but it was qilite o bv io us that her mind was back in Paris with Jund.” 

And while Caro line’s mo ther. 
Princess 
Grace, may hav e dreamed o f her daughter marry ­ ing the heir to the British thro ne, fnards o f Caro line’s say that if she and Juno t are stiU go ing steady by the end o f summer, they will wed at the palace nex t i^n n g . 

“ They get o n v ery well to gether and it’s o bv io us they lo v e and care fo r each o ther,” o ne Pari­ sian friend o f Caro line’s to ld THE 
STAR. 

“ Ev ery bo dy is ho ping that it wiU lead to marriage. H<mefully fo r Prince Charles he wiU find lust as wo nderful a partner — but fo r sure it wo n’t be Princess Car­ o line.” 
Prince Charles had himself asked fo r the dates with Caro line to be arranged by Lo ndo n club o wner, Jo hn Mills, who used to o wn New Yo rk’s El Mo ro cco . 
“ It was six mo nths ago ” said 
Mills. “ At a dinner in Lo ndo n 
Prince Charles leaned o v er to me and grinned: ‘The nex t time we hav e dinner to gether y o u’d better fix it that Caro line is my date.’ ” 
It to o k fo ur mo nths to find a suitable date -- tte 5oth gala cele- iH-atio ns o f the charity fund-rais­ ing Variety Internatio nal, to be att« ided abo by Henry Kissinger, 
Cary Grant, and Ro ger Mo o re, 
Ho lly wo o d’s James Bo nd. 
But friends said diat Caro line had planned to attend the functio n with Juno t. And just 7 2-ho urs be­ fo re the ro y al summit they were dancing into the dawn at a Paris disco . 
Her plans fo r Juno t were shat­ tered by a sto rmy pho ne call fro m 
Princess Grace. She o rdered that 
Phili{^ had to stay alo ne in Par­ is while 
Caro line esco rted 
Charles, THE STAR learned fro m 

 to race to the arms of her pl ayboy beau 

Princess Caro Une, seated nex t to Cary Grant, seems mo re eo ncemed abo v t the o ther gnests than Prince Charles. 
Caro line shares a Jo ke with the No . 1 maa in play bo y Philippe Juno t, im they dance in a h er life, Fren ch 
Paris d isco ... 

A ro y al chill: Charles and Caro iine po litely igno re each o ther at a charity dinoMH’ in Mo naco . and PhiUppe panse fo r a mo ment, gasinf at each o th­ er, o hliv to o s to the ey es that are o n them... 

THE matching necklace, ring and earrings that Caro line wo re when dining with 
Charles, as sho wn in o ur co v er pho to , were bo ught fo r $2,2oo fro m the Giv enchy B<Nitiq|ue in 
Paris, and are aquamarine and cry stal.

Princess’ cio i^st friends. 
In defiance, Caro lii^ stay ed in 
Paris until tbe last mo ment with 
Jun(k driv ing her to the aiipo rt. 
As a result arriv ed to o late to esco rt Charles to their first functio n at the ro o fto p grill o f 
Mo naco ’s Ho tel de Pans. 
Caro Une dashed in 3 o minutes l^e, guests said. 
The nex t day , Caro Une dro v e 
Charles to a Bntish nav al frigate. 
She dro pped him at tte gang­ plank. 
Observ ers said that 
Charles didn’t ev en wav e to her as she sped back with her securi­ ty guanfe. 
That night, the co uple were to - 

 g^ter again at the Variety Club’s mimanitarian awards dinner. 
By this time Charles was well aware o f the disaster. 
Pte said: “ Befo re I arriv ed here the wo rld had already go tten me engaged to Caro lus. With o a r first dinner the wo rld had us mar­ ried and by no w the marriage ia in tro uble.” 
The o nly time they chatted waa m amicable animated ex dhai^ that began as Charles o pened a po uch o f French co l(^ne that had been plo j^iedim his dmner-plate. 
Faberge bo ss Geo rge Barrie re­ called tlut Charl^ a^ed Caro Une to sniff and issue a v eidict. Unhn- pressed, she turned to C ^ Grant and Barrie, who were sitting be­ side, and said that their Jo e Na- math ‘Brut’ co lo gne was better. 
Snubbed but o bliv io us, Charles 
^pent the rest o f the night swi^ pmg sto ries acro ss the table with 
¡er Mo o re and o ther gue^. 
Prince Charles, who is 2 B, to ld a friend later: “ It was a disaMer. 
S tye is just a ^y ear-o ld girl. What else wo uld ym ex pect fro m so me­ o ne that y o ung.” 
At the dinner, Caro line c(Mifid- ed: “ Ju^ say it was a nire ev e­ ning. Bo Ui o f us realized thid ev ­ ery bo dy wo uld try to make a headline ro mance o ut (tf it. 
“ No ne o f it’s true—it was jusd nice to meet — that’s all.”

GEMINI (May 21 to June 21) . The Sun and your ruling planet, Mercury, In your sign neats up your sign and brings energy, ex­ citement and promises nice little rewards. 
Fiery Mars teams up with Venus in an area that makes relationships very tense this month causing some frustrations. But Jupi­ ter, the planet of luck, hovering over you enhances your prestige soon. 
CANCER (June 22 to July 22) . Your social life is bright with many invitations and par­ ties aloft. Curb your Cancerean possessive- ness — restrictions are what makes a love or friendship up tight. Steep in your inner def^hs, meditate and do some introspection up until the 22nd when you are more togeth­ er. Keep all situations out In the open and avoid gossip. Peai^ and quiet benefit you.

SAYINGS 
OF THE 
WEEK .. 

• KEN RUSSELL, film direc­ tor: “ I think I will never go to the cinema again. I just don’t hotter going anymore and I don’t even know what films are being shown. I prefer spending my time listenmg to music and reading because 
I’ve seen enough films to last me a lifetime.” 
• DIANE KEATON, the ac­ tress, talking about ter rela­ tionship with Woody Allen: 
“We’re beyond getting in­ volved again with each otter 
— and beyond really hurting each otter, which is a wonder­ ful place to get with someone you love. There’s humor, affec­ tion and a certain dependancy between us.” 
• S.I. HAYAKAWA, freshman 
U.S. senator: “ When I first went to Washington I thought, what is li’l ol’ me doing with these 99 great people? Now I ask myself, what am I doing with these 99 jerks?” 
• RAYMOND ST. JACQUES, big-spending actor-producer: 
“ I’m not Sidney Poitier who makes $1 million per picture. 
Birt publicists and fans contin­ ue to tell you you’re a super- star, and if you’re not careful you’ll try to live like you’re one.” 

• RAQUEL WELCH, the mov­ ie sex symbol, assessing her­ self: “ Actually, my han& and feet are great. My back is won­ derful. Cteekbones are great. 
My hair looks better wten it is wet.” 

COMEDIAN Totie Fields, 46, has l<»t ter left 
1^ arei an eye to her circulatory ailment, but she still wows fans with her salty night club act. Totie laughed before a recent Las Vegas appearance: “ You know why I came throu^ all this? I wouldn’t give George Johnson (ter husband) the pleasure of a second wife.” Se­ cret to Totie’s up-beat attitude: “ Sophie Tuck­ er gave me some advice wten my career be- 
»an. She said, ‘If you wanna be in this jusiness a long time, you gotta plan y^rs 
^lead.’ That’s exactly what I’m doing.” To­ tie’s Las Vegas act will be stewn on Home

Roy Rogers wants a final ride on Trigger 

TV’s Jesus is about to become a daddy 

THEY married during a mini-furor about their living together while he filmed the TV blockbuster, Jesus Of Nazareth. Now Robert 
Powell, 32, and his wife, Babs, are expecting a child in November. Said Powell; “ We’re ab­ solutely delighted. We don’t care if it’s a boy or a girl, we got married because we’re in love and wanted a family — not because peo­ ple demanded we get married. My part in Je ­ sus Of Nazareth ted nothing to do with our getting married last year.” B^s was working as a go-go dancer wten she met ter hubl^. 

THE Father in the center is the father of the 
Father on the left. The unique situation came about wten Thomas Holahan, Jr., (left) was ordained recently in New York City. Hola- han’s fatter, Thomas Sr., became a Fatter two years ago, after his wife died (the Catho­ lic Church prohibits married priests). After becomir^ the first father-son Fathers in the 
United ¡^tes, Thomas Jr., 29, said: “ I was very happy during the ceremony. I wasn’t nervous at all. It comes at the end of a i»t)- cess I started a long time ago, but it has the finality of marriage.” Said the proud fatter. 
Father Thomas Sr., 52: “ It’s a pretty special occasion. We’ve been praying for this a long time. Don’t make too much out of this fatter- son thing: We both just warnt to serve God

QUART Of WATtR k PAY 

HUMANS need to drink a quart of water a day to make up for the water they lose through the kid­ neys, prspiration and breathing, says the National Geographic ^ ciety. 

A man doing hard work under a hot sun expels two quarts of per- 
^iration an hour, the Society adds. 

GROWING old is no problem for Roy Rogers, 
64. The King of Uie Cowboys bowls twice a week (average 18o), is a deputy sheriff, his 
88th movie (Mackintosh at T j) was released last year. Roy’s net worth of $3o million keeps him comfortable, and his Roy Rogers Mu­ seum in Apple Valley, Calif., keeps him busy. 
Tte museum also keeps him close to his friends. Bullet (a dog) and Trigger (a horse) wte are both mounted (“ I hate to say stuffed,” says Roy). Roy admits to a hanker­ ing to join his pais in mummified glory when tte time comes. Said Roy; “ Wten I die I’ve told Dale just to skin me out and put me up on 
Trigger like the old days, and ru be tel 
Dale Evans’ reaction to Roy’s request? 'Said 
Dale: “ I always let flby 'do what te wants.”

 his foot for the fir^ time « 1 U.S. soil ■— or rather Astroturf. What m ak^ the 31-y ear-old frwn Munich worth millions while the aver­ age U.S. leaver is lucky to get $1o,ooo in a 
§ ood y ear? Soccer bosses explain that, like irazilian idol Pele who came to America two 

 y ears ago, he’s already an established star. 
And with Pele retiring this y ear, the soccer leagi» needs someone who can draw fans. 
They hope the sexy Beckenbauer does Uie tricx. Said B^kenbeuer: ”I am locking f<xr- ward to the exciting, new challenge.”

TWENTY y ears ago, Chita Riv­ era (below) got her start in slww iHisiness as a street-wise gai^- leader’s girl in the musical West 
Side Stoiy . Now her daughter, lisa Mordente (left), is about to make it big herself as a gurn-pq ;>- lang brat in tte film version o t the 5(te - flashback musical, 
Grease. Said Lisa, 2Q: ‘‘If it wasn’t for Mama with her talents and personality , I w<xildn’t be in the business. Being her dau^ter, we’re naturally very much alike. 
But being my own ^rson, there’s enough difference to tell us apart. 
We get along beautifully . Mom’s a great teacter.” Chita’s husband and Lisa’s father, Tony Mordente, is a CaUfornia director

HEREDITY TEUS 
HO W MUCH ftEEP YOU NEED 
THE AMOUNT of sleep y ou re­ q uire each night is an inherited q uality , say s a prominent psy chol­ ogist. 
“We can’t will ourselves to sleep less, any more than we can will ourselves a third leg,” say s 
Dr. Wilse Webb, professor of psy ­ chology at the University of Flori­ da. 
His research shows that every individual has a body clock which tells how much sleep is enough for him. 
The body clock is run by genes ttiat are inherited from the per son’s father and mother. 
Sleeping disorders tend to occur most often when a person tries to change his normal sleeping pat­ tern, Dr. Webb said. 
“The thing to remember is that the need for sleep takes care of it­ self,” he added. “Nobody ever died from a lack of sleep.^’

PROFESSIONAL and technical workers, are having an easier time finding jobs than people from any other occupatimial group. 
Iterbert 
Bieimtock, regitmaJ commissioner for the U.S. De­ partment, of Labor’s Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, said that one out o f every 'six jtrt» being created since June 1975 is for people with 
IHtrfessional or teclmical skills. 
In June 1975 there were 12,7 million professioiml and technical workers in America. Today there are 87 o,ooo more. 
Bienstock said the current un- miploy ment rate for professional and technical workers is Just 3:2 percent, while the national aver­ age is 7 perçait. 
That jobless rate is the lowest o f any major occupational group except for managera and adminis­ trators. The unemplo^ent rate for thém is 2.9 percent.

Harry finds life a drag in S.A. 

TMf SAN ANTONIO STAR— May 39, 197 7 
PAGI 19 

Harry stands 
5-feet- 
9-inches tall and weighs in at a less-than-petite 
19o pounds. 
He’s broad-shouldered and slightly overweight. 
A typical, average, all-American male . . . except for the bright red nail polish . . . and the makeup on his face . . . and the hot pink lace dress he wears. 
Looking like the typi­ cal, average. all-Ameri­ can male is not neces­ sarily synonymous with being the typical, aver­ age, all-American male 
— at least not for Harry, a 26-year-old Mississippi transvestite. 
In street parlance, 
Harry is a drag queen. 
He is also new to San 
Antonio. “ I came here because I heard through a friend this was a nice city and has a lot of op­ portunities for drag­ ging,” he says. 
“ Dragging” is slang for men who dress and act like women. 
And once in full drag, the only thing male about 
Harry is his athletic supporter. “ I do have to wear a male article of clothing, usually under­ wear, when I ’m dragging 
— that’s state law —■ otherwise, I could get arrested,” he says. 
“ Most drag queens are gay. I came out of the closet 
(went public) about three years ago. I went to a drag bar and later was talked into do­ ing a couple of shows.” 

H A R R Y , who is en­ rolled at a local trade school, explains that dragging was a way of life for him in Mississip­ pi. 
“ I used to get $15o for two nights for pantomiming and danc­ ing songs in drag. I once performed for 8oo peo­ ple. 
“ Dragging doesn’t stop with the show’s final number. The curtain may go down but the

 queens mix and mingle. 
They go out in public in drag. They have a second cup of coffee and some eggs at a restaurant. 
“ Don’t get me wrong,” he says, “ they don’t alt do that. But some queens are outrageous in public and realty cause scenes.” 
Why does he drag? 
“ I used to do it for the money. I quit for a year and a half, but I missed it. It’s fun. I enjoy doing it. It’s hard work getting ready for a show, but I love it when the audience loves me. 
“ You know it’s a good feeling when you can please a group of people. 
When you’re performing, it’s entertaining. 
“ This is the dress I’m wearing tonight,” he said as he removed a plastic bag covering a lace garment. “ It’s the first dress I ’ve bought since I’ve moved here. 

“ I’m usually real sim­ ple — lace and chiffon are my favorites. I ’m not as glittery as some of the other queens,” he added. 
“ Dragging isn’t dan­ gerous, unless you go out on the street and decide you want to pick up straight men and make fools of them — you can get hurt — but you’re safe as long as you keep it in the bars,” he said. 

BEFO RE THE inter­ view, Harry was re­ hearsing for a disco number he would per­ form that night as a birthday gift for a friend. 
By late afternoon he would have the song down pat —• choreo­ graphed and mimicked with precision body ges­ tures — a sexy tilt of the head, a coquettish sway of the hips, a tender pucker of freshly mois­ tened lips. 
He applies his own

 makeup, sometimes tak­ ing from IVi to 2 hours of brushing, dabbing and lining. 
“ When I get my ma­ keup like I like it. I ’ll slap my dress on, fix my wig and slip into my ht'els.” 
And like a pseudo-Cin­ derella, Harry will enter a world of gaiety with a 
$7o gown, one-inch gold metallic heels and a brown, heavily sprayed shoulder-length wig. 
Do his parents know? 
“ My mother . . . and . . 
. all of them . . . they don’t interfere with me. 
They don’t discuss it. It’s my life and I guess they just always wish me luck with my life.” 

IS HE escaping? Is he happy? 
“ I ’m not escaping. I ’m doing my own thing. If only more people were more ofien-minded about these things. We don’t want to change straight people’s lives, we just want to be part of the straight world — sort of the best of both worlds. 
“ Is that so hard for people to understand?” 
“ IT’S FUN,” Harry says of dragging

THIS I BELIEVE.. . 
By Steve Dunleavy 

Smug liberals are in for nasty shock 

THE LIBERA LS are still licking their lips over President Richard 
Nixon beir^ publicly humbled. 
Okay, one score to them. 
Btrt before the saliva dries on their lips, it is only fair to warn them that they are in for a big shock. A very big shock. 
It will come in the form of a book called The Washington Con­ nection, an exhausiively-research chronicle of hi-jinks on Capitol 
Hill. 
We have had our fair ^are of the Wilbur Mills-Wayne Hays scandal. Perhaps they were iso­ lated incidents, sad incidaits of 
Democrats who just may have put a foot wrong. But just in case we have all been luiiea into ihiniung that the Mills-Hays adventures were isolated incidents, 
The 
Washington Connection tells us more—much more. 
It tells us that while the Demo­ crats were screaming for Presi­ dent Nixon’s blood over the Wa­ tergate panty-raid, there were six 
Democrats, ctmgressmen and sen­ ators, who were doing some rath­ er terrible things in the name of 
Democrat democracy. 
At least one of them took money from a foreigner, a Korean called 
Tong Sun Park. 
It also tells us that some of these Democrats were employing secretaries for as much as $^,- 
ooo-a-year (when was the last time a blue collar worker ever made that kind of money?) for highly un-secretarial jobs. 
In short it makes tite stories of 
Fanne Fox, who blew the whistle on Wilbur Mills, and Liz Ray, who blew the whistle on Wayne Hays, look like Surxlay School reading. 
The author of Washington Con­ nection, Mr. Robin Moore, who wrote The French Ccxinection, has had some frantic letters from some lawyers representing the 
Democrats in question pointing out the libel consequences. 
“ I really don’t care too much about it,” he told me. “ I’m going 

 ahead with the book anyway. 
These Democrats, liberals, some of them, have been in important positions. We have tape record­ ings and documents that prove just what they have been doing. It 
IS subtly ironic that these same men were screaming to hang Nix- on. Well, 1 guess uiey did. But now they are screaming for a dif­ ferent reason.” 
Moore, who makes no bones about being a conservative, said that he tried hard to find a Repub­ lican who was similarly involved. 
“ For just sound publishing rea­ sons, and for the reason of balanc­ ing the book and for reasons that everyor« knows my conservative leanings and for just riain good sense, I tried to find a Republican mixed up in the same way the 
Democrats were. 
“ I tried ve^ hard to get the goods Ml a Itepublican, so did some of my reporters working on the book with me. Believe me, they are not necessarily conserva­ tives. But we came up with noth­ ing.” Given that Moore, a con­ servative, m i^t find some spe­ cial delight in pinning these Dem­ ocrats to the wall, it doesn’t alter facts. 
Those facts, rather biblical, have to do with castii^ the first stone and people who live in glass hous^. 
Nixon was a fool for what he did but he didn’t do it because he was making it with some little lady on Capitol Hill and he didn’t do it to put some money in his bank from a Korean. 
There is an image in the coun­ try that all Rejxibiicans are fat cats, rich people who are playing at politics for a diversion and that all Democrats are working guys who are playing it for all they are worth for the working man. Oh yeah? 
People Uke without sin. ou and me are not my wife would f t annoyed as hell if she thought was paving ^,ooo a year for was some c ck to do my typing. 

GI RLS WALK OUT ON 
BROKE OMAR SHARI F 

HOLLYWOOD heartthrob Omar 
Sharif cannot find a steady girl­ friend because he’s broke. 
“ I have no girlfriend now. In fact I have no friends,” said the 
46-year-old star. “ They dwindled away when I lost all my money.” 

Sharif, who rose to stardom in movies like Lawrence Of Arabia and Dr. 2}iivago, blames gam­ bling and bad luck in business for his financial troubles. 
The last time he was in the U.S. he dropped |9o,ooo in a bridge tournament. Then he lost thou­ sands in Imd iMisiness (kais. 
“ I’ve had the most terrible bad luck in the last seven years,” he said. “ During that time I earned millions and it has all gone,” he said. 

Sharif, who divorced actress 
Faten Hamama 12 years ago, still wants a family. 

“ My ultimate dream is a true love and children,” he said. “ But that is all it is, a dream. Now I just go from tournament to tour­ nament and each night I go to bed alon«.” 

Sharif has one son, 2o-year-old 
Tarek, from his first marriage. 
He says he is growing increasing­ ly disillusioned with women. 

“ Just when you think you un­ minds derstand how their work they do something to amfound you,” he said. “ AH I know is that the rnore women I go out with the lonelier and more disillusioned I become.”

One doctor in 
US. for every 
49o persons 

THE NUM BER of doctors in the 
United States is increasing four times as fast as the population, says the American Medical Asso­ ciation. 

In 197o, there was one doctor for every 613 people in the coun­ try. But today, that ratio is one doctor for every 543 people. 

Ttie 
Department of 
Health 
Education and Welfare estimates that by 198o, there may be one doctor for every 49o people in the nation. 

Part of the reason is the in­ crease in the number of medicall schools, says the AMA. 

During the 1975-76 school year, there were 13,561 medical gradu­ ates—almost double the number that graduated in 196o^1. 

Another reason is the number of I foreign trained doctors — one out of five — are now practicing in the United States.

Low prices draw more buyers to mobile homes 
M O BILE homes are getting more popular with buyers as their qual­ ity improves and the price of standard homes soars ever high­ er. 
Median price of a standard sin­ gle-family home is now $48,ooo. 
For a mobile home, it is $14,ooo. 
A new federal code for mobile homes has significantly improved their quality, accordili to James 
C. Hughes, author of How To 
Choose The Best Mobile Home 
Site (Hughes Publishing Co., Tuc­ son, Ariz. $1.95). 
Hu^es said buyers of mobile homes shmild be careful when se­ lecting a mobile home park. 
“ Select one that caters to the kind of people who share your in­ terests, is near the things that can niake your living more conve- nient, and has rules and fees that are satisfactory to you,” he said. 

THOUSAmS COME 

TO SB ‘ GOD’ S FACE’ 

MORE than 1oo,ooo people have visited Holy Trinity Episcopal 
Church to see ‘‘God’s fæe.” 
They see the face outlined in the veil that covers the tabernacle at the 1oo-year-old stone church in tiny Shamokin, Pa. 
In 
Catholic and 
Episcopal churches, consecrated Commu­ nion wafers, or “ hœts,” are kept in the tabernacle, which is placed in the center of the altar at the end of Mass. 
Nine-year-old Iris Fregley first saw the face of Christ in the veil and described it as “ God’s face.” 
She pointed the face out to a group attending a prayer meet­ ing, word spread, and soon visi­ tors were streaming to the church. 
The Rev. Frank Knutti, rector, called in four volunteer priests to 

 help him deal with the crowds. 
One of the four. The Rev. John 
Gramley, told THE STAR: “ Some people see it, sòme see nothing.”

More women working now 

THE NUM BER of women in the labor force has almost doubled in the past 25 years, says a top fami­ ly life education specialist. 

Ilene M iller, of the Texas Agri­ cultural Extension Service, re­ ports that women compose about 
4o percent of America’s labor force. 

In the past 3o years, more and more of tte working women are wives and mothers, she added. 
Economic pressure is one of the main reasons they’ve sought em­ ployment. 

Their income is needed to sup­ plement their husbands’ earnings and to maintain or raise their families’ standard of living.

A little less nagging too. Try treating him like a lover. He might even become more romantic—and more fun. 
21-27 points: You could be the bossy housekeeper type-but you try hard not to be. Good for you. I.nve is more important to you than order but do be careful that little rules and regulations do not creep into your lives. You are both happier without tnei»m. 

 the important things first! Tell him he’s a lucky man.
