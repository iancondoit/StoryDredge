Yoe can call 
Carter today 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Things to do Saturday: (I.) Wash the car. (2.) Shop for groceries. (3.) Call the President. 

The show will be carried in San An­ tonio by radio station WOAI — that s 
12(Mi on the AM band of the radio dial. 

Jim m y C arter will be in the Oval 
Office from I to 3 p.m. C ST awaiting your call and who-knows how m any others. 
It’s the first-time-ever perform ance of a P resident as a radio call-in talk show guest, a chance for the ordinary citizen to catch the car of the m an in the White House. Ask or advise. Either is fair gam e. 
And an added bonus: W alter Cron* kite will introduce you to the P re s­ ident. 
As C a rter's press secretary. 
Jody Powell, said, people m ig h t be d isre s p ec tfu l to the P r e s id e n t , b u t never to Cronkite. 
Tollfree 
The num ber to call, as they say on more modest talk shows, is area code 
9(H), 242*1611. T h at’s right, area code 
9(H) — a tollfree num ber. 
The program , produced and paid-for by CBS, is c a lle d “ Ask P r e s i d e n t 
C arter." It’s a device to de-isolute the 
P re s id e n t. If it w o rk s, s a y s W hite 
House TV adviser Barry Jagoda. it will be done again. 
Frankly, your chances of getting in are m inim al. CBS figures that P re s­ ident Carter w ill be able to field 5o to 
IOO questions in the two com m ercial- free hours. C o m p u ters th a t ch a n n el calls from around the country to 2o telephones in the White House complex will seek to assure fair geographical spread. 
Phone lines 
Phone lines open ah hour early. The callers who reach the White House will be asked th eir n am e and d ire c to ry lis tin g of a d d r e s s a n d te le p h o n e number. CBS staffers will verify them and call back to say hold for the P re s ­ ident. Nobody will screen the subject matter. 
The whole thing will be taped and shown later on some public television stations. 
Curter and Cronkite will be in the 
Oval Office, shielded from all that ac-

Briscoe pushes m oney proposals 

AL STIX 
(A F) 
— 
Gov. 
Dolph 
Briscoe said 
Friday that legislators will still have a $93 6 million surplus if they enact all of his spending and tax relief proposals. 
Sex oral legislators base contended that there I s n t enough money to enact B riscoe’s proposals to in­ crease public school and highw ay funding, hike benefits for retired teachers and repeal the sales tax on utility bills. 

Briscoe's estim ates include the funding of all state operations for the next two years, an additional B825 million for highways and $893 million to raise the slate financing of the Foundation School P ro g ram to 
IM) per cent. 
The estim ates, released without com m ent in re­ sponse to a question in T h u rsd ay ’s news conference, are based on Comptroller Bol) Bullock’s Novem ber figures, the governor said. 
Briscoe's estim ates also include a $194.5 million increase in retired teacher benefits, about half that being sought by the Texas State T eachers Associa­ tion. 

Uncle Sam has run up risky financial liability 

WASHINGTON — Uncle Sam’s credit around the world is as good as gold. Yet our federal uncle has run up a staggering “ contingent liability’’ that could jeopardize government-guaranteed loans, pensions and insurance benefits. 
The federal government has danger­ ously overextended itself by the incon­ ceivable sum of $3.4 trillion. 
T his outlan d ish fig u re is th e sum total of all federal benefit paym ents, loan g u a r a n te e s and in s u ra n c e p ro ­ gram s. 
The lio n ’s sh a re , a w hopping $4.6 trillion, is the am ount the government is obligated to pay in federal pension benefits. 
It is unlikely, of co u rse, th a t this enorm ous obligation would ever come due at once. But a national calam ity could c re a te such a d em a n d on the governm ent that it m ight not be able to meet its com m itm ents. 
Just 5 per cent of the liability, if it should suddenly become due, would cost the T reasury $85 billion. 
Real danger 

But the real danger is the constant, sp e cta c u la r increase of this "c o n tin ­ gent liability." 
It has soared ail astounding 1oo.7 per cent just since 1971. And no end Is in sight. 
The governm ent has also lost control of the pension deficit.

Glomar Explorer 

Two years ago, we broke the aston­ ishing story th a t the C en tral In telli­ gence Agency and the Howard Hughes organization had joined forces to hoist a sunken Soviet subm arine, or at least part of it. off the bottom of the Pacific. 
Now- w e h a v e le a r n e d fro m th e 
Howard H ughes p ap ers that the late billionaire tried to turn the taxpayers’ investment into a profit for himself. 
T h e a m a z in g s u b m a rin e feat w as achieved by a giant claw which was lowered three m iles to the ocean floor. 
With TV c am e ras for eyes, the great claw clam ped hold of the sunken sub and lifted it slowly to the surface. Ac­ cording to some reports, the sub broke apart and the largest section plunged back to the bottom. 
Cost taxpayers 

We a lso re p o rte d th a t th e s e c r e t v e n tu re cost the ta x p a y e rs an e n o r­ mous $4oo million, m ore than twice the cost of the Hoover Dam. 
Yet the retrieved sub was 18 years old, obsolete and, therefore, nothing m ore than a curiosity piece. 
We questioned w hether it wus worth 
$4oo million to fish out of the Pacific a plaything for the adm irals. 
The secret H ughes pap ers indicate this didn’t trouble Hughes. 
He instructed his attorney. Chester 
Davis, to study the possibility of ex­ ploiting th e d eep -sea claw for co m ­ m ercial purposes. 
The attorney suggested in a March 
26, 1974. m e m o th a t th e G lo m a r 
Explorer, as the great claw was called, m ight be used for m ining the ocean bottom or laying u n d e rs e a oil p ip e­ lines.

8o draw places for city races 

By JAMES MCCRORY 
A 
- 
V Eighty candidates, or their representatives, drew for ballot position Friday in the April 2 city election. 

In the major race, the citywide race tor mayor, the Rev. L. C. Glasco drew the favored num ber one spot on the 
»ballot. 
T he “ Big T h re e ” iii the m ayor s race. Dr. Jose San Martin, John Mon­ terey and Mayor Lila Cockrell, drew four, eight and nine respectively. 
Councilman Henry Cisneros, repre­ sented by his father, was the only in­ cumbent councilman and candidate for re-election to draw the num ber one spot. Ile is running in District I. 
Other firsts 

O ther num ber one placem ents by district, went to Murrene Gilford. Dis­ tric t 2; S. A. F u lc h e r, D istric t 3; 
Johnny Mata, District 4; Cecilio M ar­ tinez, District 5; William Lane, Dis­ trict 6; Joe Alderete, District 7; Fred 
Barricklow, District 8; Jim Dement, 

District 9, and Bill Healey, District IO. 
But even those candidates who didn't wind up in the coveted num ber one spot in each place on the ballot found some reason for optimism. 
For example, a couple of candidates who drew number seven observed that is a lucky number. 
Politics was breaking out all over in other areas, also. 
Rick Greene, a candidate for District 
2, was ruled ineligible because his pe­ tition d id n 't con tain the re q u ire d minimum IOO names of voters in the district. 
But Greene committed himself to running again in 1979 and threw his support to D istrict 2 candidate Joe 
Webb. lie also threw his cam paign platform to Webb. 
The ineligibility of Greene reduces the number of candidates to a mere 8o, still a record in a city election. 
ABC mystery 

Mystery still surrounds a supposed list of candidates that Alliance for a 
Better City will be supporting, and a separate list of 'candidates it is sup- 

Tlie 'Big Three" in the mayor's race* Dr. Jose San Martin, 
John M onfrey and Mayor Lila Cockrell, drew positions four, eight and nine respectively 

 posed to be targeting for defeat. 
Cisneros blew the w histle on the 
ABC. but conflicting statements leave it unclear whether such a list exists. 

Cliff Morton, an ABC member, F ri­ day said about Cisneros’ allegations about the lists: 

“ There isn’t any list. If Mr. Cisneros can find one, I d like to see it." 

As to reports The Pitluk Group, one of the city’s largest public relations firm s, was given the supposed list. 
Morton said he isn't surprised to see 
P itluk hand ling four of the nam es which were supposed to be on the list. 
That would be Councilmen Ford Niel­ sen. Bob Billa and Richard Teniente and candidate Jim Dement. Morton pointed out Pitluk had handled the 1975 cam paigns of the three councilm en successfully, and Dement is a com ­ mercial client of the firm. 

Bob W illiams. N ielsen’s cam paign coordinator, said ABC doesn't tell him or Nielsen what lo do in any sense of the word. 

“ Ford’s not a handpicked candidate of ABC,” W illiam s said. Ile added 
Nielsen had decided to run for re-elec­ tion long before ABC even came intd existence. 
He said there may be ABC m embers on Nielsen’s steering committee, but the com m ittee is m ade up of people from many organizations and all walks of life. 
Nielsen’s opponent. Councilman Phil 
Pyndus, had a different view of the situation. 
“ I’m not surprised that big monied developers headed by Cliff Morton. 
Charles Becker and Ralph Langley are out to get me because I have been a thorn in their side.” Pyndus said. 
1 
“ When their motives ran contrary to 

 the good of our city, I opposed them and refused to become their puppet to be manipulated at their pleasure and profit." 
Pyndus noted lie voted against cer­ tain developers in their plans to deve­ lop land over the aquifer and voted against the purchase by the city of 
Morton’s Fox Run water company. 
Pyndus refusal 

P yn dus said he refused to allow 
Morton Southwest to run slipshod over the rig h ts of in d iv id u a l p ro p e rty ow ners in zoning c a se s and voted against subsidizing developers outside the city limits. 
“ It is difficult to understand why so many businessmen have deserted the principles of the old CGL (Good Go­ v e rn m en t 
L ea g u e ) to su p p o rt developers’ interests,” Pyndus said. 
He said he hopes the reputations of the G reater San Antonio Chamber of 
Commerce and the business commun­ ity won’t become as discredited and damages as has the Home Builders 
Assn., “ when (Tiff Morton! stormed city hall with threats of recall of the mayor

SALINAS, Calif. (AP) — Inez G a r­ cia. who killed a man she said helped rape her and became a feminist sym ­ bol of a woman s right to self-defense, was acquitted Friday of second-degree m urder after a retrial. 
The jury of Bl men and 2 women deliberated nearly ll hours spanning two days. The trial started Feb. 14. 
Mrs. Garcia was convicted in 1974 of second-degree murder in the death of 
Miguel Jimenez, who she said stood guard while another man raped her. 
»'• The California Court of Appeal over­ turned the conviction on a technical ground in December 1975. Mrs. Garcia was released on 15,(WO bail after serv­ ing 15 months in prison.

All four new district courts will ultimately be housed on the second floor. To make room for them, three county courts will be shifted — two of them to tin* first floor and one across the hall into the renovated jury room. 
The courts now occupied by Couti* ty-courts -at-law Judge Carolyn Spears and Judge Carol Haberman will go to the first floor. The third shift of a county court has not yet been decided. 
Fourth court 

The final space for the fourth court will be the existing special d istrict court area now used by visiting judges. 
Com. Tom Stolhandske. meanwhile, noted that a sm aller central jury room may require two jury calls a week in­ stead of the single cull issued each 
Monday now. 
About 5oo persons are called for jury duty every week now.

F riday night, the celebrity walking into the airport was another reporter 
— G e rald o R iv e ra , the New York- based ABC-TV newsman known for his controversial stories. 
The 33-year-old Rivera, whose work has touched everything from m igrant w orkers to deplorable facilities for some mentally retarded hospital pa­ tients. was in San Antonio to speak about his work at Incarnate Word Col­ lege. 
Approach 
At the airport Friday, Rivera called his unconventional approach to jour­ nalism “ going behind the headlines. 
“ What I hope I’m doing is using my position . . . to improve the lot of peo­ ple w herever I c a n .” explained the man. who says he’s half Puerto Rican and half Jewish. 
“ I think TV has a profound potential to change social abuses . . . to iron-out the unevenness.” 
, 
Reporters can be participants i i i that social change, he said. 
For example, he said he was doing a story Friday morning on child abuse. 
“ The story is not just that there is child abuse — but it’s also why is the problem still around?” 
Rivera also said the change he seeks is torturously slow in coming. 
But. lie said he liked w orking in 
•television better than working as an attorney (he was a “ radical New York attorney” before joining ABC) because he could reach more people — make a bigger difference. 
Rivera's ideas about newsgathering a r e n ’t con ven tio n al. Ile said he doesn't believe in 
“ objective” re­ porting. 
“ I don’t know what objective is — to me it is one of the most phony words. 
“ To me the key is truthfulness.”

Jobless at 
7.5% for 
February 

COM PILED FRO M WIRE SERVICES 
WASHINGTON - Fac­ tory layoffs caused by fuel shortages helped push unemployment up to 7.5 per cent of the la­ bor force in February, but a government econo­ mist said Friday the worst of winter’s impact appears over. 
Though unemployment increased over January’s 
7.3 per cent rate, there were signs of economic strength in the February jobs report. 
Total employment in­ creased by 4oo.ooo. the labor force grew by 
83o.o(H). indicating more people had hopes of find­ ing jobs, and the average length of unemployment declined from 15.5 weeks in January to 14.7 in Fe­ bruary — lowest in 21 months. 

Lower milk supports asked 

WASHINGTON - The government’s Council on 
Wage and Price Stability has called for a sharp reduction in milk price supports, saying the cur­ rent support level will drive retail prices up about two cents a gallon. 
The council said main­ taining support prices at current levels of parity would cost the govern­ ment $185 million in milk purchases and would cost consumers $328 million.

WASHINGTON - Se­ cretary of State Gyrus

Vance told newsmen. But he suggested the situa­ tion is incomplete now and ambiguous

Soviets: Dissidents spy 

ASSOCIAUD PRISS 
MOSCOW 
- 
The 
Soviet newspaper Izvestia said Friday that Russian dissidents worked with a major U.S. Central Intel­ ligence Agency spy ring in 
Moscow to collect military and scientific secrets. 

Izvestia, in an article almost two pages long. printed photographs of al­ leged secret C IA messages and a drawing showing how a secret package was to be delivered to Am erican agents. 
The article also charged Western correspondents had collaborated with dissidents to distort events in Moscow . 
It named reporters for The Associated 
Press and Newsweek m agazine, neither of whom now work in the Soviet 
Union. 
Sharpest attack 

The article, the sharpest Soviet at-' tack so far on the Soviet dissident movement, attempted to prove leading critics are in the pay of Western intel­ ligence agencies and are dedicated to destroying the Soviet stat* 

Most of its fire was directed at Mel- vyn Levitsky, a first secretary in the embassy who has since been trans­ ferred back to Washington, and Joseph 
A. Prose!, now a member of the em­ bassy’s political section. Also named was Alynn -I. Nathanson, who resigned from the embassy last year. 
Associated Press correspondent 
George A. Krimsky, who was expelled from the Soviet Union last month, and 
Alfred Friendly Jr., a former corre­ spondent here for 
Newsweek magazine, were referred to in general terms as having supported dissidents and possibly being linked with U.S. intelligence. Both have denied the previously published charges, as have 
The Associated Press and Newsweek. 
Diagram 

Izvestia printed a diagram purport­ ing to show where dissidents left secret messages for the CIA on the outskirts of Moscow, a photograph showing how 
CIA money and instructions for dis­ sidents were concealed in a bag and a photocopy of alleged CIA instructions. 
In Washington, the spokesman for the State Department, Frederick Z. 
Brown, declined to comment on the substance of the article. “ It is our 

 standing policy not to comment on al­ legations of CIA membership or ac­ tivities,” he said. 
The U.S. Embassy said only that it was studying the report. 
Much of the Izvestia article relied on a long “ open le tte r” from S .L . 
Lipavsky, a former Moscow surgeon who until last month was active in the dissident movement. 
Pawn 

Lipavsky said he became involved in the CIA operation after m eeting several Russians who were already in the American agency’s employ. He said he had been interested in helping bring pressure on the Soviet Union to let more citizens emigrate, but soon became a pawn in an operation de­ signed to collect military intelligence. 
’ He said he was drawn into a group consisting of m athem atician A lex­ ander Lerner. 65, currently an active 
Jewish dissident, and David A/bel and 
Vitaly Rubin, dissenters who have al­ ready emigrated. 
He claimed Peter Osnos, Washington 
Post correspondent in Moscow , relayed a letter from Rubin written after his emigration to dissidents inside the 

Soviet Union, calling for a campaign against U.S.-Soviet trade. 

Osnos said Friday he was outside the country on leave at the tim e. No espionage activities were attributed to 
Osnos. 
The dissidents “ had a single plat­ form and a single leader — American intelligence and anti-Soviet organiza­ tions abroad,” Lipavsky said. 
Instructions 

Lipavsky said he received instruc­ tions from Levitsky of the U.S. E m ­ bassy to “ induce the head of a scien­ tific institute in suburban Moscow to cooperate with the CIA.” 
“ Radar and submarine communica­ tions are very interesting for us and we ask you to try to buy photographs for us with more details,” the CIA suppo­ sedly told him at one point. 

Lipavsky said Preset was another contact at the embassy and he quoted him as saying one that he “ came to the 
U.S.S R. to shatter its pillars.” 

Lipavsky said the dissidents were enemies of detente out m ainly for publicity and their own profit.

 taken place in Sprague staff meetings shortly after they took place, even though he and Sprague were no longer speaking to each other 
None of the memos Mrs. Baish wrote 
I; to Gonzalez’ administrative assistant. 
Gail J. Beagle, nor her frequent phone 
J: calls to him concerned information re- 
J. lating to the assassinations under in­ vestigation. she said. 
Miss Beagle said “ spying” was the wrong word for what Mrs. Baish was 
I doing. 
. 
She said copies of Sprague s stall f meetings were delivered to the con­ gressman's office, but not until the 
Feb. 9 meeting minutes was there any indication of Sprague's intentions against Gonzalez. 

U n u s u a l m o v e s 

Gonzalez tried to lire Sprague on 
Feb. IO, and at a staff meeting held by 
Sprague then, no minutes were taken at the request of Sprague, Miss Beagle said. 
But before then, Sprague had issued unusual instruction to his 173-member 
I’ staff. 
“ He would tell the staff that none of this (discussion) is to go to any member of Congress, which is ridicu­ lous because this is a congreessional investigation,” Miss Beagle said. 
“ The unwritten emphasis was that nothing was to go especially to the new chairman (Gonzalez)," Miss Beagle added. 

D e a t h p r o b e s 

The committee is supposed to inves­ tigate the murders of President John 
F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther 
King 
Jr ., but little has been accomplished because of budget prob­ lems and internal wrangling among the chairman, the other ll committee members and the 73-member staff as­ sembled by Sprague. 
Mrs. Baish said she never dealt dir­ ectly with Gonzalez. She said she openly took notes at staff meetings as part of her job as office manager for the so-called JF K task force. Within an hour of typing these notes for Sprague and his senior associates, she said, a 
I copy was on Gonzalez’s desk 
“ Obviously, I didn’t advertise what I was doing to Sprague’s people, but all of them knew I had come to the staff after 41 -j years in Mr. Gonzalez’s office as a part-time employe and that I had 
• been recommended by Gail Beagle for 
.the job,” Mrs. Baish said.” “ Further- imore. Mr. Sprague told me when I was hired that ‘Congressman Gonzalez and 
: his aides are your bosses.” ’ 

R a y m a y te s tify 

ASSOCIATED M ISS 

WASHINGTON — The embattled 

House assassinations committee has a letter, purportedly from 
James Earl Ray, indicating his willingness to discuss testifying Bn the murder of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. st 

Chairman Walter Fauntroy, of 

 the subcommittee investigating the 
King assassination, confirmed meanwhile that Ray and his brother are among witnesses he wants to call in his investigation of the assassination of the civil rights leader. 
J 

But Fauntroy, Washington D.C., 

 delegate, indicated they are not the source of new information he said 
(he committee has on King's as­ sassination. He continued to refuse to say what that information is. 

The chairman said he would li^e 

 to hold public hearings this month, but is not sure the subcommittee can move that last. 

The subcommittee has a letter 

 carrying Ray’s name and signature rejecting the insistence of his lawyer, James H. Lesar. that he not testify before the committee. 

Ray is serving a 99-year sentence 

 in a Tennessee prison on conviction of assassinating King in 1968. 

‘ G r e a t p a i n ’ 

Mrs. Baish. a divorcee who runs a secretarial service from her home, said it caused her “ great pain and re­ gret” to be reporting on the doings at 
Sprague headquarters 
Mrs. Baish cites what she said were 
“ unprecedented and ridiculous dic­ tates to the committee and chairman and members of Congress by a non­ member staffer — an egomaniac — 
Sprague.” 
It was she. Mrs. Baish said, who provided Gonzalez’s office with the names and salaries of the employes hired by Sprague In all. she said. sh° sent written reports of seven staff meetings to Gonzalez 
Much of what she reported had to do with hiring and wage practices. De­ scribing her own job interview with 
Sprague. Mrs Baish said. "H e made it short and sweet. He advised me of the spot I was to fill as office manager of 
, the JF K task force and asked what salary we had discussed at our first interview. I reminded him we had talked about $18,5oo. He said, ‘How about $18,ooo?’ I agreed happily. 
Sprague then said, ‘Gail and the con­ gressman will be your bosses. The ad­ ministrator will be your immediate supervisor.” 

S p r a g u e a n g r y 

When she began to believe that there was a plan within the committee and staff to usurp Gonzalez's chairm an­ ship, she said. she began to watch and listen and report anything she thought would be harmful to the chairman. By the time the House voted to reestablish 

 the committee and Gonzalez officially became chairman, she said. “ All im­ portant data had been delivered to 
Gonzalez’s office by me, both typew­ ritten and by mouth. 
“ Sprague was very angry at Chair­ man Gonzalez and the U.S. Congress,” she said. “ To have on file a record of all that was said at the chief counsel’s staff meetings, I initiated the practice of taking the meeting minutes and a copy of these was immediately deli­ vered to the chairman’s office . . . ” 
At one staff meeting, she said. 
Sprague expressed his anger at Con­ gress for suggesting salary cuts and staff reductions. When one staffer asked if Gonzalez was a friend or foe, she said. “ Sprague lost control and berated Congress and the chairman.*’ 

L a s t m e e t i n g 

She said Gonzalez, aware from her reports of what was happening, began trying harder to let Sprague know where he stood. 
“ Sprague grew in anger," she a'd- ded. 
. He projected Gonzalez to the staff as an unfeeling, insensitive, ig­ norant, ridiculous chairman and he coin eyed that he was lobbying for the support of the other members of the committee, and succeeding. The stuff was believing, and impressed.” 
Mrs. 
Baish recalled a final committee meeting was set for Feb. 
18. 
‘‘From the tone of that last stuff meeting." she said, “ with Sprague's rule-or-ruin war whoop com ing through loud and clear, I got word to 
Chairman Gonzalez’s office that to wait until the meeting would mean disaster tor the chairman. . .’’ 
The order firing Sprague was hand delivered to the chief counsel three hours later.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen Jr. 
Friday called for an investigation into the withhold­ ing of natural gas from production in the East and

Glen Hartman sent a memorandum to City Mgr. Tom Huebner instruct­ ing him to focus in on details of a rate relief plan. 

Council passed a resolution 
Thursday setting out a commitment to perfect a plan by March 31 to provide lower bills to gas users during the winter months. 

Council voted Thursday to settle out of court the two-year-old lawsuit against the city’s gas supplier. Lo- 
Vaca Gathering Co. and its parent. 
Coastal States Gas Corp. 

While the settlement makes the best of a bad situation it does little to help consumers, Hartman told a City 
Hall news conference. 

In addition to providing what relief city government can provitoward de, the city must also work state and federal solutions, energy conservat­ ion, they said, including . 
EARTHQUAKE 

Continued from Page I X because the lines had been cut by the earth tremor. 
Radio Bucharest was quoted in 
Yugoslavia as saying the Romanian army w,as providing water and electric power. 
The night clerk of the Intercontinen­ tal Hotel, largest in Bucharest, said by telephone that only the city's newer buildings came through the quake without damage. 

The clerk said Bucharest radio reported that the quake was some 5o miles from the capital, “ and army troops and rescue teams have been dispatched to the area to dig out the dead from the debris.” 

A spokesman for Austria’s Central 
Institute for Meteorology and Geodyn­ amics in Vienna said the quake proba­ bly caused widespread dam age in 
Romania’s Transylvanian Alps. 

Julius Drimmel, a seismological ex­ pert in Vienna, said the quake was recorded at 7.5 on the Richter scale and was believed centered in the alps, which link with the Carpathians to form a mountainous sem icircle through the center of Romania from northwest to southeast. 

North of capital 

The National Earthquake Informa­ tion Center in Golden, Colo., said the quake was centered about 65 miles north of Bucharest. 

Frightened residents reported tremors in the Soviet Union, Hungary, 
Yugoslavia, Austria, northern Greece and central Italy. No major damage was reported immediately from those countries. 

Radio Bucharest was off the air for about \y% hours after the quake struck at shortly before 9:3o p.m. local time, a spokesman for Radio Free Europe said in Munich. West Germany. 

Several people were reported injured 

 in Yugoslavia, at least one of them seriously, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from Bel­ grade. It said 17 people requested medical assistance in Kragujevac, a city south of Belgrade, and all the in­ jured had been hospitalized but were all out of danger. 

Yugoslavian officials said tremors cracked walls in old buildings and sent people fleeing into the streets in Bel­ grade, Sarajevo and Zagreb. No ser­ ious damage was reported in Yugos­ lavia. but many people stayed for several hours in the cold streets after the tremor. 
Hungary 

The Hungarian news agency MTI said “ residents of multistory houses ran into the streets” and factory work came to a standstill in cities near the 
Romanian border in ea ste rn and southern Hungary. 

Tanjug reported from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia that the quake sent residents fleeing into s tre e ts and parks. The tremor caused no major damage in central Bulgaria but elec­ tric power and telephone connections were occasionally interrupted in some areas, Tanjug said. 

Houston killings rising rapidly 

HOUSTON (AP) - -The whodunil murders are coming in faster than I can put men on them ,” Police Ll. 
Breck Porter said Friday. 

The veteran homicide officer said his detectives are so busy on other crimes they have little time to look into a recent rash of unsolved slayings. 

Seventeen of the 3o February’ deaths are unsolved and Porter said there were no more than eight unsolved eases at any time in a single month last year. 
KIDNAP ENDS 

Continued from Page IA after the ordeal and had not had any sleep for at least 36 hours. 
“ Even so,” Mrs. Rich said, “ he ap­ pears to be very calm.” 
Smith was able to tell Mrs. Huh about the ordeal. 
According to Smith s account, the custom er walked to the store and asked to see a .357 magnum. 
While Smith demonstrated the gun, the customer slipped two shells into the pistol and said, “ We’re leaving.” 
Gunpoint 

He then marched Smith at gunpoint through the store to the lot where the clerk s car was parked. The gunman order Smith behind the wheel and the two drove off. 
Smith said he drove the entire 6oo miles, stopping only for gasoline and coffee and hot chocolate at truck stops, 
Mrs. Rich was told 
Although pointing the gun toward 
Smith much of the time, the gunman said he had no desire to hurt anybody. 
Smith said the gunman did not ap­ pear to be on any kind of drugs, was not intoxicated and was very collected. 

Smith said he had no idea why the gunman finally decided to let him out of the car. 
Hitched ride 
After being released. Smith hitched a ride to Capitan with an unidentified motorist. 
The clerk told au th o rities the blond -haired gunman appeared to be 
26 to 29 years old and clad in a tan jacket, light brown shirt, dark brown slacks and brow n suede shoes. 
Sm ith’s car, located three miles south of Montanan by Lincoln Sheriff 
Bill Elliot, was being examined for fingerprints late Friday. 
However, no identification of the gunman had been made by late F ri­ day. investigators said. 
Smith's father, Wayne G. Smith of 
142 E. Palfrey Drive, flew to Carrizozo iii Lincoln County Friday night and was expected to return with his son 
Saturday. 
Ironically. Smith had planned to quit his job at Oshman's Saturday to be­ come a truck driver and to concentrate 
Ins interests as a country and western rock aud roll musician, investigators said.

Kumors switch to Reasoner fH 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS-—Saturday March 5 I 977 

New VORK TIMES SERVICE 
The rumor winds that have buffeted Barbara 
Walters at ABC News for months have shifted now to her colleague, Harry 
Reasoner, and to the 

 president of the ABC 
News division. William 
Sheehan. 
Friends of Reasoner, who co-anchors “ The 
ABC 
Evening N ew s” with Miss Walters, have 

 been saying that he has spoken privately of the possibility that he might resign in a few weeks — something 
Reasoner denied in a telephone in­ terview. 
Meanwhile. 

 executives of ABC have been speculating about the uncertain future of Shee­ han in his present post. 
These new reports. while unsubstantiated, have adversely affected 

 morale in the news division. 
Taking note of that, 
Frederick 
S. 
Pierce, president of ABC Televi­ sion. told a group of exe- utives in a meeting last

 week that he would dis­ close in a fortmgh what changes, if any, he con­ templated for the news division. 
Until two months ago.i 
Pierce had been in 
^charge of all television activities for ABC except news and engineering. 
His responsibilities were broadened in January to include those two d i­ visions, in recognition of his extraordinary suc­ cess in im proving the network's entertainment ratings. 
That developm ent served to diminish the rumors concerning Miss 
Walters — these had her traneferring to 
Washington or being re­ moved from the newscast because Pierce had played a role in wooing her away from NBC last spring with* salary offer of $1 million a year. The signing of Miss Walters for ABC was one of 
Pierce’s major achieve­ ments. 
The new talk of changes for Reasoner and Sheehan has been generated by suggestions within the company that 
Roone Ar ledge w ill be given charge of the day to day operation of the new s division. 
As head of ABC Sports since the early 
19Hos. 
Arledge has been one of the com pany's most prized executives, noted for his fla ir for show - manship and for building his division into the leading sports organiza­ tion in television. 
Recently, he indicated his disappointment in not rising higher ut ABC by exploring with NBC the possibilities for a top network position. 
Ac­ cording to sources at 
NHC, the network was interested only in d is­ cussing a producing ar­ rangement . 
R estlessn e ss 
Arledge’s restlessness, and ABC’s desire to keep him, contribute to the theory held by many at 
ABC that he might be gi­ ven a new management position. 
This would obviously cloud Sheehan’s status as president of the news di­ vision, but it would also make the critical differ­ ence in whether 
Reasoner remains with 
ABC News. Reasoner is known to have taken ex­ ception to statem ents made about him by A r­ ledge.

Cude seeks new trial in firing dispute 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday March 5 1977 Page__IO^. 

Dist. Clerk Elton R. 
Cude Friday asked for a new trial in his dispute over Bexar County Civil 
Service Com m ission’s jurisdiction over his staff. 
A district court judge here last month found the commission does have the right to hear dis­ charge appeals brought by Cude’s employes. 
Cude, in the motion for a new trial, disagrees and takes exception to 

Reasons for firing nixed 

DALLAS (A P )—Sister 
Louise Scheessele, pre­ sident of St. Paul Hospi­ tal, said Friday the ho­ spital fired 
P a tricia 
Driscoll because of “ a number of performance related reasons. To state all these reasons would be an invasion of privacy between the hospital and the employe.” 
Mrs. 
Driscoll, vice president of nursing ser­ vices, sparked a con­ troversy when she openly supported revision of the 
Nurse Practice Act. 

Legislative bills proposing such revision currently are being con­ sidered in Austin where 
Mrs. Driscoll outlined in a news conference events leading to her dismissal from her hospital post. 
She said it was because of her support of revi­ sion. Rep. Frank Gaston, 
R-Dallas, said her dis­ missal was “ tragic.” 

 some of the court's find­ ings and actions in the earlier hearing. 
The district clerk has 
— as the court required after upholding the com­ mission’s order — rein­ stated the employe in­ volved in the case. 

The record shows, however, Cude has also given notice of intent to appeal the court s de­ cision. 

The continuing cour­ troom dispute over the application of existing civil service rules to 
Cude’s employes hinges on the two-year-old firing of Mrs. .Joyce Cadded. 

Mrs. Cadded, until the end of 1974. had been employed as an arraign­ ments clerk in Cude’s office. 

She protested her fir­ ing to the commission. 
The commission found in her favor and ordered 
Cude to reinstate her. 

Cude, according to later court record, failed to do so and the commis­ sion took the matter to district court. 

This case appears to mark the first time the commission has asked the courts to enforce one of its orders. 

At the time of her dla- charge, Mrs. Cadded was earning about $6,9oo an­ nually. The court direct­ ed she should be rein­ stated to a job with a comparable level of pay and given back pay.

Mayor hopefuls debate selling CPS 

By JA M ES MCCRORY 
John J. Monfrey Friday sug­ gested selling the city-owned 
( ity Public Service to private industry. 
The mayoral candidate's suggestion brought to life a press conference go­ ing its lackadaisical way until he ga\e it the verbal shot in the arm. 
Occasion was a press conference sponsored by the Professional Chapter of the Society of Journalists. Sigma 
Delta Chi, at El Tropicano Motor Ho­ tel. 
Seven of the nine candidates - Mon­ frey. George Bigley. Susan Garry, Dr 
Jose San Martin, Mayor Lila Cockrell and James Willingham - attended. 
“ My personal preference would be to sell CPS to private industry outside the political realm, and I guarantee you rates would be lower." Monfrey said. 
Fast reactions 

Mon Trey's observation drew imme­ diate reaction from the other candi­ dates in the race 
“ I do not advocate selling CPS to a private utility,” Mrs. Cockrell said 

She said while she realizes rates are high in the gas and electrical utility field, she said the only reason they’re not higher is because San Antonio's utility is owned by the public. 
The mayor said 8o per cent of the cost of the fuel bills is due to the cost of fuel, with only 2o per cent going to administration. 

She said 2o per cent is lower than adm inistrative costs in privately owned utility companies. 

San Martin, a former city council­ man and mayor pro tem. said he also is against selling CPS. 
“ I ’ve never been in favor of selling 
C PS." San Martin said. 
The doctor explained when the citi­ zens own their utilities there are nu­ merous savings for the ratepayer in the form of taxes not paid. 
‘‘Even­ tually, the citizens would be the losers if they were to sell the C P S .” San 
Martin concluded. 
But Monfrey won support in his po­ sition from Bigley. 
" I believe with Monfrey that we should sell because we're in such bad shape," Bigley explained. "P riv a te enterprise could do it better.” 
Susan Garry, one of two Socialist 
Workers party candidates for City 
Council, said she would like to see the utility under the control of the working people. She was wearing a button set­ ting the theme of her campaign, "H u ­ man Needs Before Profits.” 
Board eyed 
Appointment of CPS board members also came under discussion by the candidates, but it was pointed out by most that under the bond indentures the board is authorized to fill vacancies on the board. 
San Martin noted it would take half a million dollars in lawyer fees alone to contact all the bond holders and change the method of appointing CPS board members. 
Monfrey, in answer to a question about new City Mgr. Tom 
Huebner. said he was a little confused as to why City Council had to hire a man from Sacramento, Calif., as city manager. 
He noted Huebner was the number 

Mon freres suggestion to sell CPS gave a heretofore lack ad ­ aisical press conference a verbal shot in the an n 

 two man in Sacramento and had been passed over twice there for number one man. He said he also doesn’t un­ derstand why the council had to meet at 7 a.m. on a Sunday to hire Huebner. 
Monfrey agreed Huebner is "on a honeymoon,” and it will take him up to four or five months to learn the ropes here. 
But Monfrey said he resented re­ marks ho said Huebner made about 
"com petents, incom petents and drunks" in city government. 

I via n asks equal time to tell other side of 'Roots’ 

N EW Y U R K (A P ) - The Grand 
Wizard of the Ku Klux Elan demanded on Friday that the Elan be given equal time on television to "present the other side" to ‘‘Roots," the eight-part series on the history of a black family. 
David Duke of Jefferson. La,, citing the Federal Communications Commis­ sion's Doctrine of F airness, demanded the time in a letter in ABC-TV P re ­ sident Leonard Goldenson. Duke said he presented the letter to a security chief at the network s offices and that lie was assured it would be delivered. 
Ile said he was then ushered from the lobby. 
There was no immediate comment from ABC on Duke’s request. 
Viewer record 

The ABC.’ series on ‘‘Roots,” based on the popular novel by Alex Haley, drew record viewing audiences last month. 
"It was a vicious malignment of the white population in Am erica," Duke said later. “ It portrayed our race in a negative light and has incited black haired and violence against the white majority.” 
"Roots” is Haley's fictionalized ac­ count of his ancestors’ a rriv a l in 
America and their life under slavery 
Duke said the Elan wants to present an eight-part historical documentary, but would agree to a drama series, sim ilar to "R o o ts ." if the network pressed tor it. 
The Elan production would present a picture o f-the Reconstruction period 
"from the historical perspective of a white Southerner." Duke said He said a new production of "B irth of a Na­ tion.” based on Thomas Dixon s book, 
"The Elansrnan," would satisfy the 
Elan’s demands. 
Duke said "Roots” failed to note that 
Three plead innocent in voucher fraud case 

Three of the 28 San Antonio civil service workers who had F B I com­ plaints against them tor alleged!' filing fradulent travel vouchers plead­ ed not guilty Friday. 
U.S. Magistrate Joseph Leonard set 
March 18 trials for Tony Hidalgo. 
Gilbert Valero and Jack Waddle — all 
Kelly Air Force Base civil service employes. 
Seven Air Force base employes were convicted last month for filing false travel vouchers. 

Huebner had told the Taxpayers 
League of San Antonio he had been told, and he expected to find, there were some very competent city staffers, some incompetents and some with drinking problems. He said after his arrival he found that was so. 
Bigley told the journalists: 
“ Let’s have more General Doolittles and less Lila Do-Nothings.” 
Mrs. Cockrell said under her lea­ dership government is accessible to the public and the press, and she said 

 she intended to continue with an open door policy. 
“ At City Hall we operate in a glass house, under a m icro scop e," the mayor said. 
Susan Garry said Mrs. Cockrell and 
San Martin are long-time Good Go­ vernment Leaguers, representative of the rich and wealthy. 
Monfrey, she said. not only repre­ sents the rich but is rich himself. She accused Monfrey of being a multi-mil­ lionaire, but Monfrey later said that isn t so. He said in one speech she had accused him of being a billionaire. which he said also is not so. 
The Rev. Mr. Glasco said it is time for a change and said he could work with the 
IO individual council 

 members elected from districts. 
Monfrey said he can offer the city the fresh leadership and vitality his busi­ ness enterprises have show n year after year. San Martin agreed with Monfrey the question at City Hall is leadership. 
He said while two or three new firms have been attracted to the city, there are no figures to show how many new businesses the city has lost because of the political climate here. 

W illingham said he is a working man, would like to stabilize things for the overburdened taxpayers and get outside business into San Antonio to provide jobs for San Antonio people. 
The session concluded with Bigley doing one of his imitations of FDR. 

DAVID DUKE 
. . . demands TV time 

African tribes practiced slavery, over­ stressed mistreatment of slaves by white masters in this country, and did n- t point out that blacks in early 
America followed a caste system of their own. 
“ Our series would bring in historical facts this series contrada ted and those it did not tell," Duke said. 
The Elan s alternative would also explore difficulties of whites in the post-t'ivil W ar era, he said. 

The fradulent travel vouchers were turned up in an audit of area Air Force base workers, according to U.S. Atty 
John ( lark. 
" I don’t know how widespread this practice is. But. when an audit turns up that many, we re concerned," Clark said. 
All the complaints filed have been misdemeanors. 
The maximum penalty is a $1 OOO fine and a one year prison sentence.

Bexar legislators have a budget job 

Legislators should take ser­ iously the case being made for funding the University of Texas at San Antonio and the Health 
Science Center here. 
T h ese two institu tio n s, branches of the University of 
T e x a s S y s t e m , are in their growth er a s. 
The m ed ic a l branch is a bit better e s t a b ­ lished, but it has been given a goal of doubling its education of doctors and nurses. 
UTS A is barely open. Its stu­ dent load will increase far more over the next few y ea rs than older schools, so it is important 

I hat UTS A budget proposals be examined apart from the gener­ al formulae offered by the Coor­ dinating Board, the Texas Re­ search League and the Gover­ nor’s Office. 
It would be costly to make fixed assumptions about UTSA’s need for requested funds. Dr. 
Peter H a w n , UTSA president, forecasts a faculty reduction of 
4o if cuts indicated by the Go­ v e r n o r ’s bu d g et have to be made. For a 3oo-member facul­ ty, that is a deep cut that ought to be made only after a conclu­ sive case can be made for the cuts — if such a case can be made. 
The 
Governor has wide­ spread support for non-fat bud­ gets. He has support for making do with available funds — which will add up to approxim ately one-third m ore for the next 

 biennium than for last. It would require unusual circumstances for an e s ta b lish ed p r o g r a m , adequately funded now, to jus­ tify one-third more. 
But the UTSA case deals with a university just coming to full status, estim a te d increa se in en ro llm en t next fall of 1,ooo students. UTSA serves an area in T e x a s that w as without a public u n iv e r sity for m uch longer than good state planning should have tolerated. It is logi­ cal to a ssu m e that, the school will grow at abnormally rapid rates until it lev e ls off — as other public colleges and uni­ versities are doing. 
The Bexar County legislative delegation should make certain that the UTSA case is u n d er­ stood by other legislators. 
We urge them to be fully ac­ quainted with the budget strategy of Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, who wants caution against too- early c o m m it m e n t of m ajor blocks of m o n e y to any pro ­ gram. The Hobby approach is for a comprehensive analysis of the total state program as the basis for allocating available funds. 
We b e lie v e that a n y th in g short of that approach is playing carelessly with what is other­ wise a good state financial posi­ tion. The surplus has lim its. 
Bexar legislators owe it to their constituents to understand the limits. 
Centro 21 tax suggestions worth testing for downtown 

Centro IT, the City Council’s advisory comrrHTIee on dow n­ town, is moving significantly on basics with a series of r eco m ­ mendations adopted this week. 
The group wants an urban d e sig n staff within the City 
Planning Department, with re­ view authority that is now scat­ tered. It wants more effective review of demolition proposals of buildings hav ing historic sig­ nificance, with help to owners who m ight be en c o u r a g e d to renovate. 
One of the str o n g e s t proposals is for taxing agencies to have appraisals done on the basis of income on commercial properties. The in c o m e a p ­ 

 proach is a professionally-sanc­ tioned m ethod. An ob so lete building or one is d isu se for r e a so n s a s s o c ia te d with a neighborhood’s abandonment as afflicts some parts of downtown should have an income factor used in assessing a tax value. 
Conversely, a busy parking lot should be taxed on income value instead of the value of improve­ m ents (buildings) on the pro­ perty. 
Downtown renovation, parti­ cularly of buildings with histor­ ical value, should be e n c o u r ­ aged, particularly if the Legis­ lature completes successful ac­ tion to give a tax break for such renovation. 
After the aquifer is spoiled 

San Antonio’s future water supply is being monitored and there are some quite good laws designed to protect water quali­ ty* 
There is also strong opposi­ tion to some of the standards. 
So the battle will continue more intensely in the wake of the unsurprising Texas Water 
Quality Board’s approval of its executive director’s request to split the Edwards aquifer into seven zones for quality enforce­ ment purposes. Policing of the standards may remain as good as ever. And they may not. 
We support the consideration of the Attorney General to chal- 

'One from Castro, one from Caramanlis, one from Sadat, one from Hussein, one from Torrijos, 12 from Idi Amin and nothing more from Sakharov.’ 
UTSA cutbacks 

 lenge the TWQB action in split­ ting the aquifer, which is a sin­ gle geological formation, into seven parts. 

This area may yet have to do what engineers proposed years ago: Let the aquifer deteriorate and install purification equip­ ment. That way we could re­ c y c le s e w a g e and forget the surface supply. Wilson county and others downstream proba­ bly would need another water source, but San Antonio's prob­ lem would be solved — after a fashion. It is not a prospect to be en terta in ed with any e n t h u ­ siasm, but we may have to do it. 

Sir: There is unrest in this city concerning the fat uity cutback at tilt' 
University of Texas at San Antonio. 
Dolph Briscoe's priorities have often, been twisted, but this cutback is tin' joke of the day. In a state where natural resources abound. Texas is the last state that should show up with an anemic educational system. 
Credit should he given to the gover­ nor. He has made possible a superb road system. Boy, do we have roads; we even have roads that don't lead* anywhere! 
The new UTSA is hardly off the ground and a cut at this time would not only put its credentials in a dismal light, hilt also put an added burden on the existing faculty. 
One faculty member said that the last increase in teaching hours was more than bargained for. hut that this increase would make it virtually im­ possible lo pursue a Ph.D. 
It is important to have a highly qualified faculty to bring an influx of students. 
The only department I can really speak about is tin* Art Department. We now have the biggest and the best group of young, vital artists that San 
Antonio has had in 15 years. 
The public doesn t know this yet! 
Half of them are at UTSA. 
With these young lions around, they cannot only teach students hut teach the city what a mainstream of culture is really all about.

Vi riter correct on body functions 

Sir: Thank you Arthur Brient. Dr. 
Thosteson, trained only in drug ther­ apy. as are most MDS. simply does not understand the body's built-in safe­ guard against accumulation of waste. 
Kidneys, lungs, liver, and skin. 

This system operates inefficiently when there is a buildup of acid and minerals (phosphorus, chlorine, fluor­ ine, etc.) usually caused by overeating meats and solid fats, eggs and cheese, starches and grains. Sound like the all-American diet? 

Thus, the consumption ot alkaline minerals 
(potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc.) in the form of fruits and vegetables, allows the waste sys­ tem to function once more, as the body pH approaches normal. Thus, the 
“cleansing action.” Without the cor­ rection. the waste and mucus become a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. 

Whose idea is all this? 

Hiopocrates, who said. “ Let food be your medicine!

Standard English teaching necessary 

Sir; I must comment on the two articles about the controversy sur­ rounding the teaching of English to minority students because I have such strong feelings about this issue. Those who say that everyone has the “ right” to his own dialect are, in fact, discri­ minating against these students as

 effectively as the law ever did. For without the communicating skills of standard English, how can these stu­ dents ever hope to break the cycle of poverty and ignorance? What every child has the right to is the ability to use the language of the land: standard 
English. 

Could “ Roots” have been published iii g h e t to dialect? Would Andrew 
Young be iii the U.N. it he spoke the dialect of the rural South? Would 
Henry Gonzalez hi* in Congress if he spoke the dialect of the barrio? Would 
Yikki Carr be able to help Holy Cross school if she had tried singing in, 
Tex-Mex? 
Do Leontyne 
Price and 
Marian Anderson sing in “ Black 
English” ? 

 l eaching English .is not easy under the hest of circumstances, hut teaching young people whose speech, reading and writing skills are substandard, regardless of race, is often slow, frus­ trating work, especially when there are people who continue to tell them that they don't need to learn “all that 

 garbage" Nevertheless, if we English teachers fail to give our students the skills they need to succeed in the world, we are failing in our duty and effectively condemning them to re­ main locked in the cycle of low pay jobs, welfare and frustration. 

They cannot leave the barrio or the ghetto because they cannot be under­ stood outside of it. While masquerad­ ing as a concern for “ rights" and the preservation of “ethnic identity,” this attitude is, in reality, elitest and dis­ criminatory, whether it is intended to be or not. 

It is discriminatory because it denies young people access to the one tool that can change their lives for the better: the ability to communicate effectively. 
It is discriminatory because it elimin­ ates minorities from real competition at the management and professional levels in spite of legislation meant to increase opportunities for minorities. 
Furthermore, it is discriminatory be­ cause it is a subtle way of keeping minorities “ in their place." 

All young people have the right to expect two things from the schools: marketable job skills, and the ability to communicate in the language of the land — standard English. If we teachers fail to teach these skills, we are failing to meet our obligation to prepare young people for life in our complex American society, and help­ ing to perpetuate the misery and bit­ terness of discrimination, knowledge is power.

Air-fuel bomb debate is likely 

WASHINGTON - President 
Carter has revoked his prede­ c e sso r's decision lo sell s o ­ called ‘'concussion bombs” to 
Israel. 
In so doing, (‘arter has brought into high visibility one of the most pro­ mising and innovative non-nuclear conventional weapons tile United 
Stales has developed 
The bomb gets its name from its powerful, high-ordcr detonation which produces a violent concussion, accompanied, like a nuclear explo­ sion, bv stunning shock waves 
Fuel-air explosive 
The force which general es these crushing, instantaneous pressures 
(far in excess ut IOO pounds per square nub) is neither nuclear lls sion-fusion nor conventional nitrocellulose, from which virtually all military explosives are made 
Instead — under bs prt»p**r Bailie, 
“ fuel air explosive t FAF I — th* tjoiub is a weai*oi» bused un disper­

Although the physical principles involved iii concussion bombs a re simple, the trick iii forming and dis­ u s i n g the fuel-uir cloud and then igniting it at the correct moment re­ quires high-order technology

Robert D. 
Heinl Jr. 

Future development of an artillery version of FAE will Im* only a matter of time, 
This and many other weapons be­ gin as bomb# with relatively primi­ tive and fragile mechanisms and are then hardened to withstand tile shock aud high G-furces of gutta. 
Unlike fragm entation-type wea­ pons. such as ordinary bomba and projectiles, fuel air explosives do their work exclusively by blast and pressure, thus cutting through heavy 
Foliage or forest — as they did iii 
Vietnam — and reaching inside flunkers aud oilier fortifications and. most notably, tanks and ships 
While st Hut ural damage results, 

 the main consequence of an FAE de­ tonation is to kill personnel. 
Although fuel-air weapons are re­ garded as killers, their power goes beyond that. The Navy, for example, sank a World War II target destroyer within minutes after an FAE bomb was exploded on l»oard, 
Concussion bombs show great pro­ mise against area targets. 

They can detonate large minefields 
(an obvious aul in a quick breakth­ rough or beachhead assault), they can also neutralize large ground ar­ eas such as helicopter Umding-zoties. 
Massed enemy armor, whether ad­ vancing or in assembly areas, would be a good FAE target 
So would field-artillery positton-areas 
Artillery 
The reason 
Israel wants 
FAE bombs is that they would prove ideal for neutralizing the dense concentra­ tions of artillery, atr-defense wea­ pons aud missiles aud mass armor which 
Sm let Arab tactics used 

 against Israel in the Yoni Kippur 
War. 
One role of the concussion bomb which intrigues specialists is its possible use as a non-nuclear sub­ stitute for the small tactical nuclear weapons with which NATO is now plentifully stocked and which pose serious political dilemmas for the user. 
By contrast with tactical nuclear shells or bombs, fuel-uir munitions have no radiation and are therefore 
“clean," 
They are also iMiittically clean in that, despite crypto-nuclear effects, they are non-nuclear 

So ti President t arter — as a W hite 
(louse spokesman has said — is, iii fact, "reassessing” U S, need for concussion weapons, a negative de­ cision would Im* regarded in military circles as a major setback 

It could lie expected lo raise a 
"unilateral disarmament” cry from 
Rinse who know what FAE can do

O’Neill 

‘Carter might have something with this “ No ruffles and flourishes” approach. Maybe I’ll try it around my office!’ 

WASHINGTON — Tip O’Neill of 
M a s sa c h u se tts has just m oved into his new h e a d ­ quarters as sp ea k e r of the 
House. 
It is now becoming clear in Wa­ shington that when this gentle giant moves anywhere, people tend to get out of his way. 
He w ill be no Speaker Joe Cannon or 
Sam Rayburn, whose gavels shook this town in the past, but he is clearly the tip of the congressional iceberg. 
He promised President Carter that. he would put over a new code of ethical standards for congressmen — even cut their outside earned income to 15 per cent of their recently raised salaries — and it passed. 344-79. 
„ Gets into tussle 
He also got into a tussle with the 
White House over appointments to the two top jobs in the General Services 
Administration, and after negotiations with Vice President Mondale, O’Neill prevailed. 
He wanted Rep. Phil Burton of Cali­ fornia, who lost out as majority leader of the House by a single vote, to be chairman of the House delegation to the North Atlantic (NATO) Assembly, and against the fierce opposition of 
Chairman Clement J. Zablocki of the 
International Affairs C om m ittee, 
O’Neill had his way. 
So the speaker's so-called hideaway in the Capitol. Room H-2o4, which is about as private as Grand Central Sta­ tion. is becoming quite a power center, and what happens here in O’Neill’s relations with the other House leaders, with the Senate and the White House will certainly influence the course of the ( arter administration. 
Deceptively casual 
O’Neill’s approach to his job is de­ ceptively casual. 
He ambles around H-2o4, a polar bear of a man in a blue Irish cardigan, hanging old pictures of George Wa­ shington taking charge of the Revolu­ tionary Army and Paul Revere alert­ ing the Colonials — both painted, he claims, in his own congressional dis­ trict around Cambridge. 
"I’m accused,” he says, "of being a back-room guy and the most partisan 
Democrat in Washington, and I want to tell you something — it’s all true. 
“ We’re going to work with the Re­ publicans, God help them, but we now have a special responsibility of our own downtown and up on The Hill, and if we work together. Jimmy Carter will be a great president." 
Great invention 
To hear the speaker talk. Carter is the greatest invention since pretty girls. 
Back in the Jimmy-Who? period early last year, the speaker says, 
Carter called on him and predicted that Teddy Kennedy (then being pushed for the presidency by O’Neill) wouldn't run. and that Hubert 
Humphrey would pretend to run and then pull out — leav ing Scoop Jackson as the only threat to Carter for the nomination. 
O’Neill says he didn’t believe him, hut he hit it right on the nose. 
Can the 
D em ocrats all work together? 
Have they ever? 
O’Neill thinks it will not be easy but maybe it can be done in a new and different way. 
Look, in* says, the House, like every- hing else, has chanced —- more in­ dependent, more intelligent, new rules, new members — IBI) of them under 4o. 
“They don’t want to Im* told by the speaker or even by the President what to do. They want to Im* in on everything. 
They don’t want to Im* surprised.” 
Transformation 
So O’Neill transformed the old House 
Steering Committee, which was a so­ metime social thing under his prede­ cessor. Carl Albert, into an orderly and regular Steering and Policy Com­ mittee, including the House leader­ ship, seven m em bers appointed by 
O'Neill, and 12 elected by the con­ gressmen of their regions. 
"Collective Leadership," is now all the vogue here. 
It is called “ team w o rk ” in Wa­ shington; "Cabinet Responsibility" in 
Hie executive downtown; "Committee 
Responsibility” up on The Hill. 
Never in memory have there been so many committees or so much consul­ tation between the executive and the legislature or, at the same time, so many grumbles that the consultation was not enough 
Too early 
It is still too early to tell whether this w ill satisfy the rest of the House or how 
O’Neill and Carter will get along to­ gether. 
While O’Neill agrees that he is a 
“ back room guy” and “ the most par­ tisan Democrat iii Washington,” he bridles al th** charge that be s just a 
“stalking horse” for ( arter,

Call her a 'radical,’ maybe agree 

In most people's book, Gloria 
Cabrera would be labeled an activist. Perhaps, a radical. 
She'd probably agree. 
The dark-eyed woman with the 
Sassoon black bangs lives, breathes and works for “the movement.” 
“ The Chicano movement — civil rights," she replies when asked the definition of “ the m ovem ent" she refers to in her conversations. 
At one point Gloria Cabrera's work pushed her into running for City 
Council — just to show San Antonio a 
Mexican-American woman could run fur office, could get out and speak in public. 
I f s possible 
“ Everybody needed to see that a 
Mexican-American woman could do it,” says the 31-year-old attorney. 
-I didn't think I was going to win," she points out with a flick of her cor­ al-polished nails. 
“How could I?” 
“ A relatively unknown Mexican- 
American woman running at large . . . it was before districting." 
No, she says, she didn't run because she's politically ambitious — not for herself anyway. “ I've always been more ambitious for my people than myself.” 
That was something she inherited from her father. The young civil rights attorney says he made her what she is. 
Not anglicized 
“ I was always told to be proud of being M exican-Am erican," she ex­ plains. “ I was told to pronounce my name correctly, not to anglicize it. 
“ In school that went against the grain. It was awkward to pronounce my nam e correctly and have the teacher try to get it right for IO min­ utes.” C-a-b-r-e-r-a with it’s “ r ’s” is a hard name for the Anglo tongue. 
“ But. I had this principle in my mind. I was proud of who I was so everytime I said it I pronounced it correctly." she says. 
“ At first I did it for my father. Then. 
I was doing it for myself.” 
The glamorous, stylishly dressed woman speaks as if she has a steel spine, and as if she never doubts herself. 
She says she has her doubts, but she's strong. “ I believe in what I'm doing." 
How it felt 
During the conversation the story of how it felt to be a Mexican-American student in San Antonio schools tumbles out. 
"You had the school saying there's something wrong with you because you spoke Spanish." Miss Cabrera con­ tinues. 
Pilot returns to astronauts 
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) 
The Space Agency announced Friday that Dr. Edward G. Gibson will rejoin the Astronaut Corps Monday. 
(iibson, the science pilot aboard the 
Skylab 4 mission in 1973-74, resigned from the corps in late 1974 and worked in California prior to going to West 
Germany to work on a space labora­ tory project. 
Upon returning to the Johnson Space 
Center, Gibson will be assigned to the missions specialist office headed by 
Astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin.

Bi H U O . CORN JR. 

Do you know what a student's legal rights are on school spankings? 
Dress Codes? Suspension? 
"W orking W ith Schools," a paperback hook recently published by the 
Texas A dvisory Com m ittee to the I .S. (Commission on Civil Rights, has the answers. 
The luutk — which is free bv calling 22.’i-(*H21 
— also tells hon' lo evaluate schools and includes forms f o r filing complaints or requesting to speak be fore the school Into rd. 

"In my school you had to pay a nickel or dime — if you got caught speaking 
Spanish.” 
As if that weren't humiliating en­ ough, she says leaning forward , her eyes flashing. “ In the first grade, a little girl I considered dumb was told to explain to me what was going on in class.” 
"I knew what was going on — I un­ derstood English, but I couldn't ex­ press myself then.” 
But. her father counteracted school. 
“ My father was always saying it was good that I was bilingual. He always said I was intelligent.” 

Her father and the early school ex­ periences were part of the environ- rment molding Miss Cabrera into a civil rights advocate, a teacher and later an attorney. 
“ I wanted to help Mexican-American children through education — because it helped me." 
Now as regional attorney for the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Hights, Miss Ca­ brera is still working for Mexican- 
American education. She’s one of the masterminds behind a book for par­ ents — "Working With Your School." 
The book is an easy-to-read legal and educational guide to schools. 
“ You'd be surprised how many par­ ents don’t know there is an Open 
Meetings Law.” 
“ Mexican-American parents feel in­ 

 timidated by the schools . . . this is a book to help them.” 
(The book is free by calling 
223-6821.) 
Father taught 
You see, helping was another thing 
Gloria Cabrera’s father taught her. 
“He always said if you have a little more, you have an obligation to bring people up to where you are. He was an example,” Miss Cabrera explains. 
“ I was born to help my people in the area of civil rights. I don’t think 1 11 see the progress (to total equality) in my lifetime. But, it will come and it will come eas' r because of people like me.” 
It will also come easier because of people like her father.

NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE 
MEXICO CITY - The 
Mexican siesta hour, w hich in practice lasts as long as three hours and is used for eating and not sleeping, is being threa­ tened by a m ajor go­ vernment reorganization aimed at trimming and shaking up the country’s huge and inefficient bur­ eaucracy. 
The reorganization in­ volves reform of the en­ tire ad m in istrativ e structure, but perhaps its most revolutionary fea­ ture is the change in working hours so that no civil servant can take more than two hours for lunch and all must finish their day’s work by 7 p.m. 
Traditionally, Mexican ministers and senior of­ ficials begin their three- or four-hour “ political lunches" at 3 p.m. and then often work past midnight. 
In the mornings, they are up early for “ politi­ cal breakfasts,’’ but do not appear in their of­ fices before ll a.m. 
Disrupt families 
These nours were not only disruptive of family life — the divorce rate among cabinet members has been well above average — but, because junior civil servants and most businessmen work more norm al hours,, there was also minimal coordination within the government. 
But Mexico’s new pre­ sident, Jose Lopez Por­ tillo, who took office two months ago, feels that many of the country’s problems of underdeve­ lopment come from poor administration. 
His first m ajor ini­ tiative was therefore to try to inject efficiency and productivity into the bureaucracy. 
Significantly, nine years ago, Lopez Portillo headed un obscure gov­ ernment commission studying administrative reform. 
Today his cabinet is made up largely of former members of thai commission, including 
Finance Minister Julio 
Hodolfo Moctezuma Cid, 
Trade Minister Fernando 
Solana, Planning and 
Budget Minister Carlos 
Tello and C om m unica­ tions M inister Em ilio 
Muj leu. 
Tile technocratic or- 

By changing the w orking hours, Ixtpez Portillo is trying to inject efficiency find productivity into the bureaucracy 

 ientation of Hic new ca­ binet implies a commit­ ment to rationalize the operation of the 17 min­ istries and the 799 state- ovvned agencies and companies, which range from steel complexes to television stations. 
New hours 
The new working hours, staggered between 7 a m. and 7 p.m. to reduce tracffic jams and to save energy, are only the first stage of this reorgnization. 
Almost us ambitious is the g o v ern m e n t’s de­ cision to cut down on unnecessary personnel 
At present, with 1.2 million workers, the go­ vernment is by far the largest employer in the country, providing jobs to 26 per cent of the work force. 
Lopez Portillo h a s or­ dered that all e x c e s s sta ff either be found new jo b s or be dismissed within six months. 
And, as part of his economic austerity pro­ gram , he has strongly discouraged m inisters from taking on new per­ manent employes. 
But in a country where political discipline and personal loyalty are tra­ ditionally rewarded with jobs in each new admin­ istration, observers feel that it might he politi­ cally hazardous to appply this rule too strictly. 
The major government reorganization, however, is going ahead, with some m inistries d isap ­ pearing, some being created and others being used. Perhaps of greatest significance is the estab­ lishment of an Office of 
Planning and Budget 
M anagement, which is answ erable directly to the president. 
Tighten control 
The powerful state- owned com panies and agencies are also for the first time being brought under tig h ter control through the creation of various “ heads of sec­ tors” or "super-minis­ ters’’ who will supervise their investment and spending programs. 
For example, the min­ ister of national p a tri­ mony and industrial de­ 

 velopment, Jose Andres de Oteyza, has 247 state companies in his sector. 
T raditionally, en o r­ mous power has been concentreated in the hands of each president to the detriment not only of individual ministries but also of the 31 state governments. 

Now, Lopez Portillo is trying to decentralize the bureaucracy, although it is too early to gauge how much real power will in fact he transferred. 
Cabinet meetings 
Unlike his p re d ece s­ sors, though, the new president, who is a 

 lawyer by profession and a public administrator by training, has begun holding regular cabinet meetings. 
As a first step, he has formed separate econo­ mic and political cabin­ ets at which full debates lakes place, with Lopez 
Portillo acting more as prem ier than absolute president. 
Official sources said, however, that the presi­ dent plans to consult his 

 entire cabinet on major issues. 
Except for the changed working hours, the reor­ ganization has so far stirred up little public interest or attention. 
But m any observers here believe that it may eventually be seen as the most sweeping reform of tho six-year Lopez Por­ tillo administration and could have far-reaching effects on the country’s development.

When things sta rt get­ ting too hot between Alan and Connie, she backs otl a n d w ith a to n e of h a u g h ty in d ig n a tio n says: 
• T m only d efe n d in g my honor as any g irl w h o ’s b een p r o p e r ly brought up should.’’ 
That does it, of course. 
Alan, who is the type that divides women into nice girls and fun girls, rea­ lizes he’s up against a nice girl. 
I t ’s a c o n v e n tio n a l set-up in a conventional p la y , 
N eil 
S im o n ’s 
“ C om e 
Blow 
\ o u r 
Horn.” You know from the ou tset th a t it will have a conventional end­ ing. Connie will go all the wav only after she’s gone to the altar, and Simon never disappoints your expectation. 
“ C o m e 
Blow 
Y o u r 
Horn” is like a mind trip through the ’5os, a tim e when the double standard flew ram pant, and a man was expected to fool a r­ ound except with the girl lie loved. 
Inoffensive 
I f s te m p tin g to c o m ­ pare “ Com e Blow Your nHorn,” S im o n ’s earliest plav. with “ Love A m eri­ ca Style,” that old tele­ vision show that liked to ti t i l l a t e a lo n g se x u a l th e m e s w h ile b e in g a careful not to really be offensive. 
I t ’s t e m p tin g , b u t 
T h e a te r San A n to n io ’s p ro d u c tio n of “ C o m e 
Blow Your H orn.” is far* b e tte r than a television sitcom. It’s a fine, slick show that suffers through 
S im o n ’s d a te d c o n v e n ­ tionality and polishes Si­ m o n ’s ta l e n t a s a g a g w riter until it gleams. 
Sim on’s com edy, even before it becom es dated, too often seem s stale. But

Review 

 stops m ake “ Come Blow 
Your H orn” seem fresh again. 
At th e c e n te r of th e plav is a very freah ta ­ lent, Thom H einrichs as 
B u d d y , 
A la n ’s y o u n g b ro th e. B uddy is going through a rite of passage, breaking away from his father, a m anufacturer of wax fruit, and his m oth­ er, a woman who’s kept the cellophane on her lam p shades for IO years and who m akes Buddy eat cake and milk stand­ ing over .the kitchen sink. 
Chaste 
H e in ric h s m a k e s th e idea of a 21-year-old m ale v irg in s e e m p o s s ib le once again. And that vir­ ginity is the crux of the play. H e in ric h s m a k e s 
Buddy youthful, im possi­ bly naive and hopelessly inexperienced. 
L ater when Buddy b e­ c o m e s a m a n of th e w o rld , he e x u d e s a sw inging singles ch a rm that E dw ard E. Debiec, as A lan , n e v e r s e e m s able to m aster. Buddy is b e lie v a b le at bo th e x ­ trem es of his ch aracter, m aking the play less foo­ lish than it m ight easily have been. 
B u t S im o n a s jo k e m a k e r c o n c e n tra te s his laughter in Buddy’s p a r­ ents, played with an ab ­ s o l u t e zeal by M ark P«- m crantz and Mary Byall. 
P o m eran tz m akes the father into a great, blus­ tering bear of a m an, one to w hom a son th a t d e ­ serts petrified apples and his fam ily b ec o m e s in ­ visible. 
Byall is a show stealer without the slightest hint of guilt. H ers is a tired c h a r a c t e r , th e J e w i s h m o th e r. 
B ut 
B y a ll, f r ig h t e n e d by r in g in g telephones, quivering at th e t h r o u g h t h e r son 

 m ight not have eaten a good meal, wrings laughs from her ch aracter as if it were a sopping sponge. 
Except for Deliria Cis­ neros, who is the defini­ tiv e dizzy d a m e , th e other perform ers tend to reinforce the convention­ ality of Simon’s m an vs. woman plot. 
Pollock's direction also s e e m s to be ab le to do little with the datedness of the show, hut in those long s t r e t c h e s of p u re c o m e d y , he e x h ib its a fine k n a c k for c o m ic tim ing and delivery. 
And a f te r a s e rie s of sets at T h e a ter San A n­ to n io th a t s ta n k of a m a te ru r is h . W ayne K.

By BEN KING Jr. 
Roger Owens didn t know a pirouette from a potato, so to speak, until he hap­ pened by North Star Mall Friday afternoon and saw a mini-ballet. 
Afterwards, he said. 
“ It was fantastic, I really like it." The applause the dancers received from the crowd of about 75 shoppers seemed to echo 
Owens* sentiments. 
The San Antonio Ballet 
Company had struck again and won another victory in its campaign to win ballet fans. 
The Friday perfor­ mance was one of ll free presentations the com­ pany will be making throughout San Antonio in March. 
Most valued 
Vladim ir Marek. the company's artistic direc­ tor. explained. "This is what we value most about a performance like this. The people came out here and they didn't ex­ pect it, but they enjoyed what they saw." 
During the perfor­ mance. several members of the company danced scenes from classical ballets like “ Sleeping 
Beauty," "G iselle" and 
"Swan Lake." 
The ballet company will repeat its perfor­ mance at I CIO p.m. Sa­ turday in front of Frost 
Bros. in North Star Mall. 
Samplings 
"In these programs we try to prevent a little bit from cal li ballet to give the audience an idea what it's all about." 
Marek said 
Ile admits the mini* ballets are intended as a pleasant sort of trap for

Review 

 the unsuspecting pas­ serby who has never been to a ballet. 
"These people didn't' intend to see ballet, but now that they see it, they like it," he said. "Maybe next time they will buy a ticket and come to a bal­ let." 
The five-year-old com­ pany s main problem, 
Marek said, "Is simply telling people that we exist and that we're a professional company." 
Support 
"O u r theory is if you make ballet good and the people know about it — then the company will have community sup­ port." Marek said. 
Judging from com­ ments made by audience members, the Friday ballet had the desired ef-, lect. 
A mother of a wide­ eyed pre-school age girl . said. "This (the presen­ tation) is amazing. My daughter usually won’t even sit still for TV.” 
Armando Mora, who works at one of the mall s stores, said. "I ve never seen anything like this before. You can see it takes a lot of practice." 
Long range 
Besides winning new ballet fans, perfor­ mances like the one gi­ ven Friday may also have some long-range ef­ fects. 
After the crowd dispersed and the dancers were packing their costumes, a pre­ school age girl walked out on the performing area and started doing her version of a pir­ ouette.

He wrote, "I come to 
Paseo del Rio. the river walk. Up from the water rise the smells, a concert of fragrances dominated by barbecue smoke and tamales. I can identify sausage in there, too. and beer. 
"Now music comes up with the smells. Country music, and listeners are elbow to elbow along the rails of the little arched river bridges, looking down. A party is going

W ASHINGTON POST StBVICf, 
ROME — Fur Ameri­ can movie buffs, the word "Italy* evokes, not pizza, pasta and pinches but the very idea of cinema. 
It immediately brings to mind names like De 
Sica. Rossellini. Viscon­ ti. Antonioni, Pontecor- vo. Fellini. 
But for those Ameri­ cans who in the 195os and the 
196os anxiously scanned the papers for notice of a newly arrived 
Italian film, and later traipsed across town to out of the way art theaters, the present situation is a grim one. 
While Americans were busy lining up for Lina 
Wertmuller’s "The Se­ duction of 
Mi m i." 
"Swept Away” and “ The 
Seven 
Beauties" 
— among the few Italian films to be shown in the 
U.S. in recent yours — 
Italians were irnoring many local films. 
‘Nashville’ 
Instead they jammed theaters to see 
"Nashville," 
“ Barry 
Lyndon," "O ne Flew over the Cuckoo s Nest.” 
"T ax i D rive r." “ The 
Marathon 
M an " and 
"King Kong." lf one considers the ti­ tles of many current Ita­ lian films, the growing popularity of American films among bot Ii Italian intellectuals and the general public is not all that hard ti* understand. 
Soft-core, low-budget 
"sexy” films like "Bed- maniu, 
File Health 
Service Gynocologist," 
“ Au-Pair 
G irl." 
"M y 
Father’s Private Secre­ tary........rhe Scpdaugh- ter." 
"M y 
Father's 
Wife," "Naked Behind the 
Hedge." 
"Woman 
F ever. 
The Land­ lad y." a"ready for 
Anything," "The Erotic 
W ife ." “ Puberty and 
"Bestiality" were there to attract the sexually frustrated and to irritate 
Italy's growing feminist movement. 
Detectives 
A variety of detective 
• or “ Poliziesco” films like "The Debt Has Been 
Paid," "The Aulirobbery

The “ Brillante" Italian comedies that far out­ number any other cate­ gory of film in the daily ads were there for those in need of some light re­ lief. 
Of last year's 2oo Ita­ lian-made films Another 
JO were co-productions), 
7o were "sexy," 4o were police films, another 4o were "comico-brillante.” leaving the remaining 5o to be divided among po­ litical, period and mis­ cellaneous subjects 
Experts say the break­ down isn't all that differ­ ent from the past. 
“ We've always pro­ duced a few good films and a lot of mediocre ones." critic Giovanni 
Grazzini says. 
‘Worse* 
"Lately, however, our bad films have gotten worse, and the public bas begun to notice." 
Not only were there about IO per cent fewer spectators in 1977. but ticket sales dropped off by a record 25 per cent even in the peak Christ­ mas season. 
Dissatisfaction w it ii current domestic pro­ duction is also demon­ 

 strated by the fact that two of the live big holiday movies "King Kong" aud 
“ The Marathon Man” were American, and by the growing percentage of box-office returns go­ ing to American films. 
Gross third 
The I JO to 14o U S films shown in both 1975 and 1976 grossed abut a third of total earnings, while the percentage of box-office take going to 
Italian movies has been on the wane ever since the high-water mark — 
6J per cent — in 1971 
According to many producers the situation would be even more marked it the extent of 
U S. investment in cur­ rent 
Italian films 
(Bertolucci's "199(1" is only an extreme exam­ ple) could be calculated. 
But the major point, they say, is that the de­ clining quality of home production is causing a growing number of Ita­ lian moviegoers to either 
"buy American" or stay borne. " I ’d like to go to lie movies but there's really nothing to see" is an ever more popular re­ frain.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday March’s 1977 
Grand jury to get pot charge 

Four South Texans charged in connection with the seizure of more than 1.ooo pounds of marijuana will be bound over to the Bexar County 
Grand Jury. 

Justice of the Peace J. 
P. “ Jim m ie” Gutierrez made that ruling Friday. 
He ruled probable cause in the case following an examining trial. 

Judge Gutierrez re­ turned the ruling after hearing testimony from two Department of Pub­ lic 
Safety narcotics agents. 

The agents said they arrested the men in a rental truck on FM 253N. about four miles south of lino Jan a. 

Twenty-three burlap bags containing what is believed to be marijuana were found inside the truck, the agents testi­ fied. 

Charged with posses­ sion of more than four ounces of marijuana are 
Antonio A. Padilla, 2o, 
Hod Briones. 2o. Manuel 
L. Moreno, 32. all of 
Robstown, and Clemente 
Hernandez J r . , 33, of 
Corpus Christi. 

Court officials said the four are free after post­ ing bonds of $1o,ooo each. 

Hauck jail control asked 

A district court suit filed Friday demands the return of Sheriff B ill 
Hauck as direct super­ visor of Bexar County 
Jail. 
The suit, filed by a group of jail employes, also asks rem oval of 
Chief Jail Administrator 
Ray Olivarri, his assis­ tant Ramiro Cantu and jail inspector 
Ja c k 
Crump. 
Jail employe Robert C. 
Wright on behalf of him­ self and others claims — in the petition filed iii 
I Bkt Ii District Court — that County Com m is­ sioners violated the Tex­ as Constitution by as­ suming control of the .jail through appointment of 
O liva rri, 
Cantu and 
Crump. 

 shown its intent not to promote from within the ranks of the present em­ ployes, effectively deny­ ing them the opportunity of achieving a super­ visory position.” 

Also stated is the com­ plaint that employes 
“ have been denied addi­ tional pay and improved working conditions through the allocation of county funds to pay the 

 salaries of the appointive positions.” 
The com plaint aims also at the constitutiona­ lity of the 1973 statute that authorized Commis­ sioners Court to appoint a 

 jail administrator. 
Commissioners Court, the petition notes, ex­ empted the three top jail posts from the county ci­ vil service competitive requirements.

Contacted in New Mex­ ico, Mrs. Olivarez said 
Carter had offered her the post at a half-hour

She emphasized, how­ ever, the appointment cannot be considered fili­ al until she completes an

 of the U.S. Senate. If the appointment is con­ firm ed, Mrs. O livarez would be the third high­ est-ranking woman in the 
Carter adm inistration. one level below the two women in C arter's Ca­ binet.

Opportunity, the inde­ pendent government agencv set up by Presi­ dent Johnson to adminis­ ter the so-called War oil

Mrs. O livarez would not speculate on the fu­ ture of the CSA.

There’s Dingo. Dingo is a medium- size red dog that bears some resemb­ lance to the wild dingos of Australia. 
Dingo dances when he hears ‘Mingle 
Bells.” 
Bonnie and I were talking to Elby — everybody down there calls him. “ El­ bow” — and Venita Hanna. They run a 

Labor of love 

Nothing symbolized the boys and gulf of the Texas coast more than the nets of the shrimper. Here Veni­ ta and Elby “Elbow” 
Hanna work on the nets of the 
‘ Bay 
Rat.” 
Elbow has been a Gulf Coast boatman since he was I I years old. 

 well-known restaurant on the bank of the Intercoastal Canal at Sargent 
Beach. 
We were standing beside the water just outside the restaurant talking when Venita suddenly started singing 
‘Mingle Bells.” 
Dingo started dancing — jumping up and down, even getting his four feet off the ground and shaking himself. 
Dingo’s dancing is self-taught. 

His own idea 
“We were sitting around talking one day and the radio was playing,” Venita said. “ As the first notes of Jingle Bells started. Dingo started dancing.” 
Dingo and two other dogs the Hannas have are great fishermen. We went outside so Bonnie could take some pictures of Elbow and Venita on a shrimp boat Elbow is using, the “ Bay 
Hat.” 
Elbow started the engine and here 
Boston (for Boston Blackie) and Em ­ ma Sue came running and jumped on deck. 
Elbow and Vanita illustrate how the sea is a m agnet for people from different worlds. 
Elbow is a good oT boy born down here on the coast — “ about two and a half miles off the road between Sweeny and Bay City.” Elbow added, "and how us boys liked to see the school bus get stuck in the mud so we could go squirrel hunting.” 
Elbow started operating a boat when he was lLand is very proud of his abi­ lity to spot w here the fish are. 
“You get to where you can just look out at the water and know there are fish or shrimp there,” Elbow said. 

Power 

The sea’s beauty is often matched by its fierceness. Could there be a more beautiful scene than these whitecaps rolling in on Sargent 
. 
. 
Beach? But those selfsame waves that are so beautiful are also weapons of destruction. Soon this pretty little weekend house will 
* be swallowed by the sea. 

The Jewel 
The Hannas’ boat is “The Jewel” — 
“ I had to sell the family jewels to help pay for it,” Venita explained. 
“ It’s a small shrimp boat,” Elbow said, “ but I can make those big dou­ ble-riggers bow their heads.” 
And Venita told of some of Elbow s exploits — once 1.7oo pounds of shrimp in IO minutes — another time 3.8oo pounds of “ seabobs,” little shrim p that are great in gumbo, as one day’s catch. 
Elbow is proud of his one contact with the “ \lensa” organization. Nlensa is the national organization of people with the highest IQs — an IQ of 14o is a minimum. 
When they met at Houston a few years ago, they didn’t spend all their time discussing Einstein’s Relativity 

 and factoring Quantum Theory equa­ tions. 
They ate Elbow’s gumbo. 
Venita has kept a copy of Marge 
Crumbaker’s column from the Houston 
Post of Jan. 16, 1972. 
“ Mensa members and friends gath­ ered at the home of Imogene Williams for some of the greatest seafood you1 ever tasted. Elbow 
Hanna, the shrimper from Sargent, cooked the food on the banks of Caney Creek and trucked it in. . . “ 
Elbow talked about his recipe for this 15 gallons of gumbo — 
“ Forty pounds of shrimp tails, 15 pounds of crabm eat, one pound of smoked Polish sausage for each five gallons, six cans of chicken stock, granulated garlic, chili powder, sea­ food seasoning, okra, tomatoes. . . “ 
Then Elbow, Venita and Bonnie got to talking about how he prepared “ the roux” — and that threw me off com­ pletely. 
Venita is a pretty, blue-eyed blonde. 
She was office manager and secretary for a cluster of six doctors in the Texas 
Medical Center at Houston. Then she 

 got a weekend place at Sargent. 
“ I loved it more and more,” Venita said. “ Finally one weekend I just couldn’t bring myself around to going back early Monday. 
“When I didn't show up until Tues­ day morning, one of the doctors told me — ‘You just have to come to work on Monday.’ 
“ Then in a nice way, I told him I didn’t have to come to work on Mon 

 l f y o u 're lo o k in g fo r so­ mething with the fu ll flavor o f <>« • sea in a c o m p a r t p a c k a g e — try Stir g e n t 
Beach 

 days — and, come to think of it. I didn’t have to come on Tuesdays — or even Wednesdays. 
“ I suddenly realized I wanted to live at Sargent.” 
She got a job working in the little resta u ran t the H annas now own. 
Though she had never cooked before. now she wins prizes in cooking con­ 

 tests. 
“ Elby started inviting me to go out on his shrim p b o at,” Venita said. 
“ Soon it wasn't unusual for me to spend the day on the boat sorting out the shrimp on the deck. 
“ I was working like a dog. But at the end of the day when Elby would give me a pound of shrimp — then worth about $2 — I would think he was just the nicest, most generous man.” 
The shrimpboat-launched romance bloomed and soon the couple wed. 
The Intercoastal Canal gives Sargent some of its wonderful flavor. Bonnie and I could have spent the day there watching those long lines of barges pushed by towboats pass by. 
As we first approached the canal that morning, there was that wonderful deep-bass moan of the boat’s whistle notifying the bridgetender she wanted through. 
Then came the "Christine M” push­ ing a long tow of flat, decp-in-the-water oil barges in front of her. 
The bridge that carries the road out a few hundred yards to the beach is a 

The sea is a world all its own. 
It either attracts a different breed of people — or changes them once they come. 
There is no place this is truer than on the Gulf Coast of Texas. 
Last Saturday Bonnie and I went to 
Sargent Beach — looking out on a stormy Gulf of Mexico southeast of Bay 
City. 
It is not one of the highly publicized 
Texas beaches. It’s no South Padre 
Island or Padre Island National Sea­ shore or Port Aransas or Galveston 
Island. 
In fact some people think its out­ stripped by its more traditional neigh­ bor, Matagorda Beach. 

Charm 
There’s no driving for miles up and down a broad sandy beach in an or­ dinary passenger car. 
But the driftwood, the shells and the waves pounding against the shore have a charm. 
If you’re looking for something with the full flavor of the sea in a compact package — try Sargent Beach.

John A m os (right) and M ichael Shannon m ake their debut in a new se rie s, “ Future C o p ,” to n ig h t at 7 p.m . on 
KSAT-TV. 

Actor Patrick Duffy is in and out of the water in his new series. 
The day I talked with him by telephone was a 
“ dry day.” 
Duffy a n d 
B e l i n d a 
Montgomery m a d e their debut last night on NBO in “ The Man F ro m At­ lantis.” T h ere will be m o re episodes of this science-fiction series on the schedule later. 
The same people who did th e “ S t a r T r e k ” s e r i e s a r e p r o d u c i n g this, said Duffy. So all you “ t r e k k i e s , ” keep watching. 
Duffy is a l m o s t a newcomer to television. 
He a p p e a r e d in “ T h e 
Last of Mrs. Lincoln” and a couple of movies of the week, but that has been it. he says. He is hoping for a long run of 
“ The Man From Atlan­ tis,” although at the mo­ ment there are only four scheduled shows. Each a two-hour episode. 
“ So far it is terrific.” s a id th e a c t o r w h e n , asked how he was enjoy­ 

 ing his new assignment. 
“ How often do you get to swim with a porpoise?” 
In his role as M a rk 
H a r r i s . 
Duffy is a w a t e r - b r e a t h i n g alien from the lost city of At­ lantis. He is only able to stay out of the water for a short time. 
“ From 12 to 18 hours is all I can stay on land.” he said. “ T h en I m u st go back. I m u s t be wet to survive.” 
As for his o u t w a r d characteristics, the man from Atlantis looks pret­ ty normal except for his e y e s an d f i n g e r s . His eyes are a metalic green an d he w e a r s d a r k glasses to hide this when necessary. And there are web fingers. 
“ I don't wear an overly amount of m a k eu p ,” said 
Duffy. “ I wear a pair of gloves on m y h a n d s s i ­ m i l a r to s u r g e o n ’s g lo v e s . T h e e y e s a r e more difficult. I wear two pair of contact lenses. I don’t wear glasses ordin­ arily so that takes a little getting used to.”

IUD not effective as Pill 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: A few questions on the intrauterine devices (IUDs): 
How long is one effective? 
How effective are they in birth control? 
Do they pose any risks? 
What should one do if pregnancy occurs? 
- Mrs. S.Z. 
In most cases, the IUD is effective until removed. 
The latest information I have is that the IUD is about 95 per cent effective in preventing pregnancy, ranking just below the Pill, which is about 98 per cent effective. 
Problems occur at the rate of about one per IOO users. 
One government pub­ lication advises that be­ fore a decision is made to use an IUD the patient W O M M A should inform the doctor of any special problems such as heavy menstrual periods, rec e n t pelvic in fection s, a tipped uterus or congenital or r h e u m a tic h e a rt d is ­ ease. An allergy to cop­ per w ould, of co u rse, rule out the copper IUD. 
It is also wise for the woman to check re g u ­ larly to be sure the IUD has not been expelled without her knowing about it. 
One of the serious problems encountered with the 
IUD is in women who become pregnant while using it. lf pregnancy is suspected, it is important to see the physician immediately. 
Insertion is a relatively simple procedure, but is best done by someone skilled in the procedure. 
Bleeding between menstrual periods (spotting) and some pain can be expected in the first few weeks after insertion. Periods may be a bit heavier and longer. Neither is considered dangerous in and of itself. 
* However, re m e m b e rin g w hat w as said about pregnancy, any delay in a period should be investi­ gated to rule that out. 
Eyelashes 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: Lately I have been getting my eyelashes stuck in my eyes. I used to be able to get them out, but no longer can. I am a senior citizen. It is very uncomfortable, and everytime it happens I must run to the doctor for fear of them getting embedded. 
How' can I get relief from this? — II.W K. 
Hasn t your doctor suggested any specific cause of this? 
Senior citizens are prone to this and other eyelid disorders, such as trichiasis, where the lashes come out easily. That is caused by an inflammation of the lid margins. With some folks, the lid margins turn inward, resulting in the irritation of the eyeballs by the lashes. Loss of fatty and supporting tissue causes this. Both these conditions can respond to treatment. 
The follicles of the eyelashes are like those of any body hair. They are dependent on good nutrition. 
Are you sure you are getting sufficient protein and vitamins? 
I think you should seek help from another doctor. 

Do you hove problem hair? Dr. Thosteson* new booklet, "Good 
Health for Your Hair," shows how proper treatment can result in healthier, more attractive hair. To get a copy, writer Dr. Thosteson in core of this newspaper, enclosing a long, self-addressed and stamped envelope and 35 cents.

Display signs 

This may be a dumb question, but it seems to me every bakery I go to has the name of the product and the price of all pastries and breads prominently displayed. 
Why does such a nice bakery at one of the North 
Side malls not post signs — either identifying the product or listing the price — for its display goods? 
I, and I am sure other customers as well, feel pretty dumb standing there not knowing what to call a delicious-Iooking pastry that I have never seen before. 
When the sales girl asks if she can help me, I just point at the product (and keep pointing — many times she can’t tell where I am pointing) and let her put some in a bag. 
Then I have to wait until she m arks the bag or rings it up on the register to see what I am going to have to pay. 
Do they plan to keep this policy of no signs permanently or are they going to put up m arkers in the near future?

“ We don’t put prices on goods because we constantly move the pro­ ducts around,” the owner of the bakery said. 
“The warm trays don’t stay in there very long. 
They sell that fast,’’ he said. 
The owner said there was constant rotation, with item s on the top shelf in the m orning m oving down to lower shelves as the day pro­ gresses. 
“And the reserve items are not always the same as the product they re­ place,” the owner said. 
The bakery sometimes combines several item s on one tray, so it would also be impractical to put the signs on the tray with 

 the goods, the owner said. lie also said a large sign listing all products and their prices would be impractical because they don’t bake the sam e items every day. 
“ It wouldn’t help the custom er who d oesn ’t knew the nam e of the product either,” he said. 
As soon as the bakery is able to esta b lish a 
“ norm al’’ system of baking goods for parti­ cular days, signs will he made, he said. 
The owner also said all girls are trained to know all the prices, and “ they w ill gladly tell the customer the name of the pastry or type of bread if he asks.”

I read in the paper the other day that a girl in 
Austin had been stopped by police while jogging topless but that they could not arrest her because topless jogging was now legal under the penal code. 
Is this true? What is the exact interpretation of this part of the code? 
Can any female jog on public streets without blouses or shirts and not he arrested?

Your Birthday Sunday . 

Life has never a dull moment this year, as you cope with ch allen g in g new influences. Learn to conserve personal e n ­ ergy, be sensible how much responsibility you accept. What seemed per­ m anen t proves readily changeable: make an ef­ fort to change things in your favor T oday’s n a ­ tives offer a blend of fan­ tasy and intuition as a line of co nv ersation . Those born this year should be highly successful c r e a ­ tively and financially in literary or graphic arts.

A spokesman from the 
Vice Squad of the San 
Antonio P olice D epart­ ment said topless jogging was not against the law. 
“ He or she has to ex­ pose other private parts before it is considered a breach of the peace or disorderly conduct,” he said. 
\ female may walk — or run — along any San 
Antonio public street 

 top less and not be ar­ rested. 
Offending any one per­ son does not m ake it against the law either, the spokesman said. 
“ It is not against the law unless her activities were exciting a breach of p ea ce,” he said. “ A breach of peace is a fight or a large gathering in­ terfering with traffic.” 

O lym pia b eer 

I am a big Coors beer drinker and have always heard there is another light beer in the country which is better, namely Olympia. 
I would like to try Olympia sometime and have heard it will be sold soon in San Antonio. is this correct? I think it is made only in Wa­ shington state now . Will it be brewed in San Antonio also? When?

ASSOCIATED WESS 

Lots of sunshine was forecast for most of Tex­ as Saturday. Thunder­ showers which plagued the eastern half of Texas earlier in the week moved out of the state, but not before dropping street-filling rains, especially in Southeast 
Texas. 
Kirbyville, 2o m iles north of 
Beaum ont, reported the heaviest rainfall at 3.82 inches. 
Other areas of East Tex­ as received from one to three inches. 

High clouds streaked across 
South 
T exas 
Friday while clear skies 

 prevailed in ther areas. 
Winds coasted from the north at IO to 2o miles per hour over most parts of the state. A southerly breeze was reported in far West Texas. 

Sunshine poured through after the cloud cover vanished and slow­ ly raised temperatures to the 4os and 5os in most areas. Early te m p era ­ tures ranged from 33 at 
Dalhart to OH at Browns­ ville. 

Forecasts call for fair weather across the state through Saturday with cool nights, mild after­ noons and highs in the 
6os and 7os.

UNIONDALE. N Y. - Nets* owner Roy Boe should request federal aid from President 
Carter, because his team is a disaster. 

Larry Kenon scored 39 points as the 
Spurs whipped the Nets, 135-121. for their third straight road victory Friday night at the Nassau County Coliseum 
It was the first time this season San An­ tonio has won thai many in a row on the road.

Kiln Hughes and ( huck Terry, tin* only players left from that heist, had 1H points and 15 rebounds. 
“ I got good position.” said Kenon. 
“ 'I lie Nets' zone just isn't that hot." 
The zone defense is illegal in the 
NBA. but the Nets use the most ob- 
\ ions one iii the league. 
“ I don't care about their zone.” chortled Spurs Coach Dong Moe from the bench at the officials, “ just call the fouls." 
"W e freelance on offense.” said 
Louie Dumpier, who scored 15 points, 
"and that s the best way to combat a zone.” 
“ I guess the officials don't call it because the Nets would get blown out every tim e,” said forward Mark OI* berding, who scored 2o. and was per­ fect on 111 attempts from the free throw line. 
"M y leg is bothering me. but I didn't even have to jump oil ms shot. There was never ans body within 2o feet of me." 
" I feel sorry for them.” 
"It was not one of their better work­ ing nights.” said Moe. "They usually work vers hard, and tbat's bow tiles

OF THE EXPRESS N EW S STAFF 

At 1o:4o p.m. Friday, the 1.785 fans at the Municipal Auditor­ ium erupted with a standing ovation. 

The West Side YMCA's David Pas- tran had just soundly defeated Alfred 
Garcia, of the City Parks and Recrea­ tion Boxing Club, scoring a unanimous decision in the second night of Regional (/ol­ den Gloves action. 
But the balance of the cheers were not for Pastran. who had boxed expertly. They were for the loser. 
Garcia. 
Garcia, technically a no\ ice boxer w ho had been put iii the 
Open Division because he was 2o years old. had stood tough in the ring against the smashing and precise punches of a skilled boxer. 
The crisp style showed by Fustian seemed greatly overshadowed by the courage of Garcia in the lightweight bout 
The following match, between na­ tional semifinalist Sammy Avala of 
C PR and teammate Raymond Pinones, also drew a big reaction from the au­ dience. but it came in the form of boos. 
Everyone had anticipated the bout because of Ayala's reputation. But in the second round of the light welter­ weight battle. Pinones’ corner re­ quested the bout l>e stopped because of 
• Ayala's complete domination of the match up to that point. 
Ayala, the younger brother of unde­ feated pro boxer Mike Ayala, fully de­ monstrated his m astery of boxing skills and bis opponent. But the crowd booed loudly when Joe Souza. Pinones' coach, asked that the match be dis­ continued

Philly slugger 
Mike Schmidt signs rich pact 

CLEARWATER. Fla. (AP) - 
Major league home run leader 
Mike Schmidt signed a rare six-year baseball contract Fri- lav with the Philadelphia 
Phillies which he indicated was worth about $2 million. 

The third baseman refused to give tin' exact prier tag of the pact hut answered, “ yes.” when reporters asked whether the figure w a s i i i the vicinity of the $2 million reported!' sought by his agent 
Schmidt, however, said dollars played second string to his desire to

 stay with the Phillies and shoot for a 
World Series v ictory. He said he leaves money matters in the dugout once he lakes tin' field. 
“ I made $12o,ooo last year and never thought about it one time while I was im the field,” Schmidt said. ‘‘I tried to carry the same personality out on the field and .just play ball. 
“ Perhaps I could have made a greater deal, made more money some place elsi*. but I really didn t want to leave Philadelphia.” 
Winners 
"We have a chance of being a win­ ning ballclub for several years and a 
World Series champion.” Schmidt said. “ To me that’s very important. 
You can’t put dollar lulls on something like that 
The Phillies won the National 
League East title last season hut gave up their pennant hopes in three straight playoff losses to Cincinnati. 
Schmidt came in from a workout to join in the contract annnouneement at a news conference attended by Paul 
Owens, the team personnel manager, agent Dave Landfield and Philly owner 
Hilly Carpenter. 
“ We will not divulge anything hut the length of the contract,” Carpenter said when pressed about the price tag and possible deferred payment or guaranteed income facets of the deal. 
Landfield. of Los Angeles, negotiated with the Phillies throughout the winter and flew to the spring training camp here oil Monday, where talks continued on a day-to-day basis

ORLANDO. Fla. (AP) - Bob 
Zender, a Chicago stockbroker before he joined Ii'.*4 tour six years ago, fired a five-under-par 
(IT and assumed a onestroke lead 
Friday in the second round of the $2oo,ooo Florida Citrus Open 
Golf Tournament. 

The burly, 21o-pound Zender. 33 and still seeking his first tour triumph, powered his way to a 38-hole total of 
138, eight under par for two trips over the wooded, wind-swept, 8.929-yard Rio 
Pinar Country Club course 

A decided longshot, Zender had a share of the first-round lead i i i the San 
Diego Open last month, but has won only $1,2oo this year. He’s never really threatened fur a title and has career earnings of $39,7oo — far less than ex­ penses.

Double-Back Dawson has perfect record 

Chances are excellent that you've never heard of Double-Back 
Dawson but in his own small circle of friends he's won a degree of fame. Of course, it was Emerson who once wrote, ‘‘fame is proof that people are gullible.” 
Double-Back really isn’t Mr. Dawson's proper first handle. You probably already guessed that but it’s all we have to work with today. Double-Back claims to be the champion gate-crasher of San 
Antonio. Maybe the best iu the nation now that One-Eyed Connally has gone to his just reward, if any.

Dawson is not yet iii the class of the late and legendary One-Eyed Connally because lie concentrates on just one area, Spurs basketball. So far, how­ ever. he claims to have attended all but one of the Spurs’ home games this season and he has yet to purchase a ticket. 

No. nobody gives him passes and he 

 doesn’t have an “ in” with gate­ keepers. That Is. he didn’t start out being friendly with tlcket-takers. 

Double-Back Dawson began his car­ eer as a freeloader much by accident. 
Last season, during the playoffs, he was with two friends who had pur­ chased good tickets earlier. He decided to go to the arena with his two pals and buy a ticket at the gate, knowing that he wouldn’t be able to sit with his companions. 
But alas, when they arrived only standing room was being sold and there was durned little of that left. 
Dawson refused to pay $4. or whatever it was. but told his friends to go ahead and that he’d “ see them inside.” 

He never saw them inside but they 

 saw him. So did everyone else in the packed house. During a time out In the third period Dawson appeared from the New York Nets’ bench area and popped onto the court with a towel in his hand. Carrying a serious and wor­ ried look on his face, he located a spot where a player had fallen moments earlier. Dropping to his hands and knees, he wiped lite arca with that towel. The referee even assisted, strolling over and pointing to another spot about five yards away. Dawson nodded, moved over, and applied his towel to that area. 

You can imagine his friends' glee in the stands, when they saw Dawson near the center of the court, acting in a semi-official capacity. He was part of the action, on stage, and it was the first pro basketball game he had ever at­ tended. 
Fresh gimmicks 

Well. that was last year, the beginning. Not only did Dawson enjoy the game but he enjoyed the game he played for free admittance. He had the whole off-season to dream up new gimmicks for San Antonio’s debut iii the NBA. 

 ll took him about two weeks to feel 

 out the tlcket-takers. There's one tall dude he doesn’t mess with anymore. 
But no matter how many times he got turned back he refused to quit. He’d lust move over to another entrance and try again, pausing only long enough for a bit of mental reflection, trying to determine the flaw in his initial attack. 

You can understand why Dawson settled on the name of Double-Back. 
But it comes from more than just his repeated efforts. Let him tell it. 

“ I came up with my hest gimmick 

 by not trying to go all the way in the first time. The Idea was to rush right up to the point of entrance, involve the gate tender with my problem, and then huck off two or three times. Finally, when I made my move I was in a hurry and me and the gateman were buddies bv then.” 

What he did was dress in neat but

 well-worn shirt and slacks and hang a set of electricians’ tools around his belt. All he had in his hands was a little sweat and a long screwdriver. On his first approach he’d ask the gateman if the center lights looked okay to him, claiming that “ some of the wheels 
(and usually the visiting team’s coach) had been complaining.” Then he’d vanish. No effort at all to go inside. 

But he kept doubling back, checking 

 those lights and asking the ticket-taker for his opinion. When he finally made his rush he timed it well. making cer­ tain that at least five or six were crowding that entrance for admission. 
He went by cursing softly to himself, rolling out names that included city council members and high NBA offi­ cials and on that move he carried one of those little light meters. Nodding to the gateman as he squeezed back several ticket-holding customers, 
Dawson said, “ we’re gonna get these durned lights right to please everybody or I'm goin’ home early.” 

Nobody stops a working man who is rushed, cranky and in the middle of a pressing job. 
Game continues 

Now then, why do you suppose Dou­ ble-Buck Dawson would sashay by my office to make this confession? Why would he blow his own cover? is he calling it quits? 

No sir. not by a long shot. Bat it’s 

 become loo easy. The tun is gone. Just about everyone now accepts him as an on-duty electrician, working at the ar­ ena. His only problem comes during sell-out games, when there’s no place to sit. Besides, only he and his two friends, plus a a few they’ve told, know of his conquests. When they don't show up for games it s a little like playing golf by yourself and scoring a hole in one. Not mucji fun without a witness, 

So Double-Back offered me his story in exchange for promised silence on his identity. “ You can’t mention my age, weight or height.” he insisted. 
Thai would make it too hard. lie s all through with the electrician act. No more challenge there. Natur­ ally, he can’t reveal his new plan of attack but, according to Double-Back, it vv ill be a “ pure stroke of genius." 
So help me. I have no idea what Ins new gaff w ill be but if I were a ticket-taker I d keep an eye peeled for a pregnant lady looking for a bally or a husband. Now that would bi* a stroke of genius. Nobody goes drag while trying to look pregnant. 
Knicks to give 
Holzm an’s Fate 

NKW YOHK (AP) — The New York Knicks of tile Nation 
Basketball Association have culled a news conference for Saturd* to announce the future status of Coach Red Holzman. 
The Knicks are in the midst of their third straight losing season and their chances of making the playoffs appear bleak. New York lias a 28-34 record and is nine games behind in the Eastern 
Division. 
In Friday’sacing Form, the thor­ oughbred horse racing newspa|>cr. co­ lumnist Barney Nagler predicted the 
Knicks would fire Holzman on Satur­ day and replace him with Bill Bradley as interim coach. Bradley, a former star who has been relegated to the bench, previously had announced lits retirement as a player. 

Nagler. who has close ties with Ma­ dison Square Garden where the Knicks play, also said Holzman, j(j. who has bee ti Knicks’ couch since 19U7, will announce formally that lie had re­ signed. 
Willis Reed. the former Knick star. lias been prominently mentioned as 
Holzman s successor. 
A Knicks* spokesman would not comment on the Hating Form report, saying only that an “ announcement regarding the Knicks’ coaching situa­ tion will be made Saturday.M

W a lle ye s in Canyon 

 read y to spawn 

Parks and Wildlife Depart­ ment fisheries biologist Jimmy 
Dean says walleyes in Canyon 
Lake should spawn next week. and he hopes to be on hand to catch some of them in the act. 

No, Dean isn't an aquatic voyeur. lie s interested in the sex life of the walleye only from a scientific stand­ point. 
Ile wants to capture some spawning females, strip them of »*ggs. then catch some males heavy with sperm-laden milt. fertilize the eggs and then send them to a state hatchery for incuba­ tion. 
The end result, if tin1 attempt is successful, will be a lot of little wal­ leyes which can be stocked in lakes to grow up and be caught by fishermen . . or another biologist scientifically in­ terested ill the sex life of fish. 

Dean has good reason to suspec t the brief walleye spawning period is at hand. Last Wednesday his technicians took 47 adult male walleyes in nets at 
Canyon and most of them were ready to spawn. 

In ease you would like to try to catch a walleye in the Guadalupe Ktver lake, the fish hit the gill nets about 7 a.iii. Wednesday, and seem to be con­ centrated along tlx* dam i i i from 5 to JO feet of water. The daily bag limit is five 
I lie walleyes which became entan­ gled i i i the departm ent’s gill net weighed from I S to .‘I I pounds Dean suvs the fish probably were some of those stocked in 1973 aud '74. plus those from the natural spawn last year 

Spawning zone closed 

Still on the subject of fishy sex (as opposed to sexy fish), the San Antonio 
River Authority closed Zone 3 of Lake 
Calaveras Thursday. 
Zone 3. from the railroad bridge north in the Calaveras arm of the lake. is closed about this time each year to provide black bass with a spawning sanctuary. 
The zone, which covers approxima­ tely one-sixth of the surface of the lake. will be closed to fishing until April IV

And still on the subject of San An- tonoio’s backyard lakes, fisheries bio­ logist Kirby Gholson says saltwater redfish stocked in Braunig are growing at record rates. 

During the first three weeks of Fe­ bruary, eight reds caught by anglers averaged more than five pounds in weight and 22 inches in length. 

The reds were stocked in Braunig 
April 25) of last year. They were four to six inches in length and weighed ar­ ound two ounces each when stocked 
They are still less than a year old 
Normal growth rate for the red in its native habitat — salt water — is about 
12 inches and one pound per year. 
Gholson says he expects the reds will be found in the shallows one to two feet deep this summer and will weigh nine to ll) pounds each. Ile reminds fisher­ men that the legal minimum size limit on redfish is 14 inches.

The winners clash for the cham ­ pionship and a berth in the state tour­ nament at 8 p.m. Saturday. 
Burbank (32-4) already owns three victories over other teams in the tour­ ney — 64-42 and 85-55 over Kennedy and 61-49 over Moody. 
That is onlv^ one of two losses on 
Moody’s 37-game slate. The Trojans bring a 17-game winning string into the meet. 
Burbank’s main concern will be in keeping 6-11 Gilbert Salinas in the lineup as long as possible. Last year he got in early foul trouble and the Bull­ dogs lost in the first round to eventual champion Victoria. 44-34. 
Such veterans as Steve Gamboa 
(11.9) and Leonard Lambert (9.1) are 

 back in the Burbank cast along with 6-4 
Ernest Puente (12.8) and sophomore point man Mike Poole. 
Kennedy set an all-time school re­ cord for victories in its 28-11 season and. like Reagan (2o-11), won its first loop cage title ever. 

Coach Armando Balderrama plans to change nothing from the earlier Bur­ bank games, so it all depends on if 
Kennedy’s hot. 
The Rockets will be counting on their front line of 6-3 Darryl Bethley (19.2). 
6-2 Rick Leggett (17.9) and 6-2 Dale 
Roberson (15.6). Guards Vincent Tris­ tan and William Young round out the starting quintet. 
Three starters are back for Moody. 

6-8 senior center Larry Earls, 6-7 sen­ ior forward Charles Moore and 5-7 senior guard Joe Garza. 
Curtis Bonds. 6-5 junior forward, was the sixth man last year, while the other starter is 5-11 junior guard Joe 
Phillips. 
Top reserves are 6-4 junior post Ro­ bert Goodlev and 6-o junior guard 
Darrell James. 

Reagan will field a starting cast of 
6-7 junior Roy Jones and 6-6 senior 
Darrell Overton in the post, and a guard trio of 6-o junior Mike L iv e r­ more. 5-11 senior Mark Taylor and 5-9 senior Buford Landrum. Like Moody starters, all five average in double fi­ gures.

In a vision, the Lord showed Obadiah the future of the land of 
Edom. The Edomites had betrayed Israel, and had even deserted them in time of need. However, they felt safe inasmuch as they had built their dwellings in high, inaccessible cliffs. 
"The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou thai dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord." (Obadiah 3-4) 
Obadiah’s brief prophecy concludes with the prediction that the land of Edom would be restored to the Lord; “And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord’s.” (Obadiah:21)

M assage p arlo r bill is not a laughing matter 

There are times when^ the Texas Legislature has flashes of statesman­ ship in its behavior. 
By and large, law­ m akers go seriously about their business of trying to do what's best for the people of Texas 
March 2, Texas Inde­ pendence Day. was not the 
Texas 
House of 
Representatives' finest hour. 
Press reports indicate that it was one of those* times in which the legis­ lative body deteriorated into a circus with clowns to be found on every hand. 
Not humorous 
The occasion was the consideration of HB34 by 
Representative 
Gene 
Green of Houston to ex­ tend the regulatory powers concerning mas­ sage parlors to county units of government. 
There s a great deal of humor evoked by sexual matters in human con­ versation. The giddiness about that subject is a study all its own. 
There is nothing hu­ morous. however, about the presence of massage parlors around the city limits of our metropoli­ tan areas without any kind of regulation as to their activities. 
The exploitation of wit- men. the tie-in with or­ ganized criminal activity verified by law enforce­ ment o fficials, the en­ couragement of and par­ ticipation in prostitution, and the disrespect for law which causes consti­ tutionally proved regula- 

 leit 
Pastor. 
First Baptist Church 

 tions to be ignored and jeered at from across an a rtificial geographical line cause this to be a problem worth serious consideration. 
Needed power 
Mr. Green's bill tracks, much of the city ordin­ ances which have been proven constitutional in 
San Antonio including ll-, censing, health stan ­ dards, suspension or re-! vocation of license for* conviction of a penal code offense, inspections, li­ mits on content of adver­ tising, clothing standards, and so forth. 
These are seriously needed powers for county government. 
County .Judge B la ir 
Reeves of Bexar County is quoted as saying, “ It s asinine to have the law circum vented in that manner. All they need to do is move outside the city limits. We live in a metropolitan arca and need the regulation. Me­ tropolitan problem s transcend a rb itra ry boundary lines.” 
It is unfortunate that 
Houston Representative 
Ben T. Reyes fought the j>ro\ isiun and that the 
House dealt with it flip­ pantly. 
It finally was sent back to committee because of a 24-minute difference in the tim e between the five-day posting of the notice and the hearing of the bill 
There s a great deal ol cynicism about political bodies iii our land 
Voters both young and 

 old have registered their discrediting of the pro­ cess by their absence from the polls. 
The disillusionm ent which is present calls for an even greater degree of responsible behavior on the part of elected officials. 
On a day when all Tex­ ans ait* called to re­ member the kind of sa­ crifice that created this 
• state by men who had statesmanship like atti­ tudes for which they shed their blood, the Texas 
House of Representatives gets a falling grade on statesmanship. 
The House p a rtia lly 
'rescued itself from its 
’day of infamy by tentati­ vely passing the b ill three days later. 

If the Senate concurs. it will be possible for the county to regulate itself in such a w ay as to create a healthy moral climate for all its citizens.

LATEST WEEK 

ON The D O W 

ANALYSIS BY CHARLES E CARDEN 

MONDAY—The market opened on the downside and stayed that way until mid-afternoon, when news came that the government's index of leading indicators dropped 1.2 per cent last month. The drop had been expected, and prices turned to the upside. Most of the day’s gain of 2.99 in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average was posted in the final 15 minutes. Among Dow stocks. 2o rose, 7 fell and 3 were unchanged, but none moved as much as a point. Volume at 16.22o.ooo shares was the lowest since the day after 
Thanksgiving. 
TUESDAY—The rally continued, and prices improved throughout the ses­ sion. The D JIA closed up 8.31. best advance this year. Volume improved to 
19.48o.ooo shares despite a halt in trading lasting more than an hour because of a fire on the fluor of the* 
N Y SE, and 13,8oo,ooo were on the upside. 
WEDNESDAY—The rally lost mo­ mentum as trading volume fell back 
The Dow average, up better than two points at its best, closed off 2.66. Gold atocks continued their independent bull market as the price of bullion in london reached its highest level in 16 months. 
THURSD AY—For the second time 

 this week, the market ignored bearish economic news. The government re­ ported factory orders in January fell 
2.1 per cent, first decline since August, and inventories rose o.5 per cent. The 
D JIA, up all day, closed near its best reading with a gain of 6.57 at 948.64. highest close in four weeks. After the close, the Federal Reserve reported money supply was down $1 billion, reversing the recent trend. 

F R ID A Y 
— The government re­ ported unemployment in February rose by only o.2 percentage points, far less than had been expected. The market was higher from the start and the Dow industrials closed up 4.82 at 
953.46, highest close since Feb. I. 
Volume improved slightly. 

SUM M ARY 
- The Dow Jones In­ dustrial Average posted its second weekly gain of 1977, rising 2o.o3. It was the biggest weekly gain since the week ending Dec. IO. But volume of trading was disappointing, amounting to only 
9o,22o,ooo shares, the lightest five-day week in 16 weeks. 

RANGE — High was made on F ri­ day at 956.28. Low was made on 
Monday at 928.61. (’lose. Frid ay, 
953.46. Gain on the week, 2o.o3. Vo­ lume, all shares on the N YSE, 9o.22 million traded.

The stock market ad­ vance Friday apparently was another peak in a rally that began late 
Monday.

“ The potential impact on food prices really threw a scare into the market, hut it’s entitled to a ra lly ,“ said Saul 
Smerling of Standard & 
Poor’s. 
“ The problem is the rallies don’t seem to develop any volume, and this is disappointing. You like to see a rally with some conviction.’’ 

Standard & Poor’s in­ dex of 4o1) industrial stocks pick up .31 to 
112. KO, and

Prices hiked for copper 

Cupper producers raised prices by 3 eents this week (ti 71 cents per pound, reflecting the rise in New York and London futures. 
Based on the March 
(New Y o rk ) delivery, prices have risen from around the 57-eent level in December to B8 cents this week. 
Other metals were also strong, especially silver and gold. 
The white metal, en­ couraged by inflationary jitters and the anticipa­ tion! of improved industrial demand, had advanced steadily this year, bouncing up by over 21) cents per ounce during the past weeks. 
Gold has benefitted from inflationary con­ cerns as well, and with the Ju n e delivery at 
$148.51) per ounce it has now reached its highest level since November 
1975. 
Demand has been strong as evidenced by this week s IM F auction in which 524.(1oo ounces were sold at an average

Delaware crisis belittled 
DOVER, Del. (A P ) — Secretary of 
State Glenn C. Kenton said Friday 
Delaware “ is not going to default.” 
He made the statement a day after 
Gov. Pierre D. du Pont said new taxes and spending cuts are needed to extricate the state from bankruptcy. 

Du Pont, who assumed office in mid-January, said in his first major speech to the legislature that Delaware was facing the worst financial crisis in its history 

 temporary tax package to pay off those bonds within 21£ years. By state law, 
Delaware’s budget must be balanced. 
Kenton, who also is the state’s chief bonding officer, said the governor’s use of the word “ bankrupt” prompted a flood of calls from investors con­ cerned about the state’s ability to meet its outstanding debts and about its over-all financial situation. 
The governor s speech was a frank assessment of Delaware’s serious fi­ nancial problems. Kenton said, but he 
He said the state would have to sell predicted the state’s resolve to deal about $56 million in bonds to deal with with them would improve the situa­ tes fiscal year’s deficit and pass a ti on.

San Antonio E X P R E S S -N E W S — 
Saturday M arch 5 I 9 7 7 
Sargent Beach is a delight 

Continued from Page IB single lane roadway. It does not raise but swings back against the land side bank. 
We crossed the brxdge several times during the day and Bonnie clambered around on it and on the nearby shore m akin g pictures. H e lp in g us were bridgetender Edward L. Price and his successor on the next shift. Charles V. 
W hite. T hey could not have been friendlier. 
Price reported there was an average of about 25 tows a day com ing through 
— plus boats. 
Late in the day Bonnie photographed the “ E lizabeth M. K e lso ” co m in g through pushing a long line of barges piled high with sand and gravel. 
“That tow is about 1.ooo feet long,” 
White said, “ but som e are 1.2oo to 
1,5oo feet — plus the boat itself.” 
That means that some of the tows are four or five tim es as long as a football field. 
But the wonder of the day was the beach and the water. 
The sky was gray and furrowed, the wind blew out of the north and the waves were popping out from shore. As a roller broke, the spray would rise high. 
But that didn’t keep people off the beach. 
Two ladies were walking slowly up the beach, stooping occasionally to pick up a piece of driftwood. They would examine it carefully and usually throw it back down. 
Hobby 
One of the w om en, a school bus driver from Houston, explained what they were doing. And is hers an unu­ sual hobby! 
“ We are lo o kin g for stic k s of driftwood that have ‘noses' on them ." 
Mrs. Harley M ilner explained. “ It’s a hobby of mine.” 
Then she show ed us a piece of

 driftwood with a spot where there had once been a limb or knot — there was a resemblance to a nose. 
“ I paint faces around the nose, at­ tach little eyes that I buy at the hobby shop and mount it on a pretty board. 
“ On this board I paint — ‘Our F a ­ mily Tree.' 
"Then there s a companion plaque. I pick up unusual nuts (and here she showed us a very big pecan) and paint a face, with eyes, on it. On this plaque I put — “ There s at least one nut in every family.’ “ 
There were other beachcombers. 
There was a group of four, three men from a Houston publishing com pany and the wife of one of them, who were 
“ treasure hunting.” But they had a modern twist. They were sweeping the

 beach with electronic metal detectors. 
"M y husband is real good at this." 
Mrs. Donna Johnson, a teacher told us. 
“So much depends on a person’s ear' for the detector sounds. M y husband has a great ear." 
We saw the husband. W illiam John­ son, later in the day. He had a handful of sm all modern coins, other metal trinkets and a M ilby (Houston) High 
School class ring of 1989 All had been found at Sargent Beach that morning. 
“ Recently I did find an 1811 Spanish half real on a beach.” Johnson said 
“ But I discovered that Ferdinand V II turned out tons of these and it was worth only about $2." 
Mr. and Mrs. Gary Gray and their 
8-year-old son. Brian, were picking up alu m in u m cans. B ria n wanted to 

"m ake some m oney" and his parents were helping him. 
Not working but having a great time on the beach wert' the two family dogs, 
11-year-old Scooter, a part dachshund, and C harlie, an appealing little light 
‘an and white puppy. 
But the big show on Sargent Beach that day was the surfing. 
At times there were IO or 12 surfers. 
In their all-black "wet suits" out in the high surf, they could have been strange cre atu res from the sea s depths. 
Sporting surf 
We talked to David H ill and Jeff 
Barnes of Bay City. 
“The waves here usually are about three feet high. That’s a little tame for good surfing,” Hill said. “ But today they are running five or six feet high and that makes them sporting." 
"T h e re 's something even more im ­ portant,’’ Flames added. "T h e wind is from the north and on this beach this makes the waves tubular — the long rollers almost circling completely ar­ ound. They are called ‘tubes’ or ‘pipe­ lines.' 
"Surfers really like to ride up and under the inside of these waves." 
On the gulf side. Sargent beach is fur from being a "tam e ” beach. That Sa­ turday more than one big tree trunk was being rolled along by the waves as though ii were a tumbleweed. 
Sad sight 
One of the saddest sights was so­ meone’s little weekend house — high on its stilts and still upright but with the waves lapping all around it. 
Back from the beach — all along 
Caney C reek — how peace’ll I . . it is. 
Caney Creek is an ancient bed of the 
Colorado River, now many miles to the south. The creek was named for a big cane brake through which it once ran. 
But peaceful crock or stormy beach 
— Sargent is quite a place! 
Beach in key Civil War role 

The Sargent Beach area played a significant role in the Civ ii War. 
In 188:5. Union forces decided to seize all Texas ports as part of the blockade of the South 
Maj. Gen. N P. Banks led an expedition heading up the coast from Brownsville. The expedition captured the ports at Corpus Christi, Aransas Pass, 
Pass Caballo and Port Lavaca. 
Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder, C onfederate com­ mander, decided to stop the Union drive at the mouth of Caney ( reek. 
Earthen redoubts were thrown up and rifle pits 

 aud trenches dug. About 5,(HIU Confederate soldiers were placed in the dirt fortress. 
Federal gunboats bombarded the fortress for about two months. Hut it held. The Federal army never attacked but decided to start on the Louisiana coast and move west against Texas ports. This also failed 
Thus the Sargent Beueh-C'aney Creek fortifica­ tions kept the South's lifeline open until the end of the war. A historical! plaque tells the story. 
Time — and hurricanes — have wiped out all traces of the fortifications.

FREEDOM HOMES com prise a M orton/S o u th w est series placed in a price ran g e fam ilies can uW nrdSacks, 

How did Morton/S.W. go to S.A.’s ‘top’? 

W hat is the main reason for 
This is the way those who have had to rent actually sacrifice nothing at all when they buy and move into a new 
Freedom or Success home by Morton / 

SUCCESS HOMES m odeled by M orton / Southw est In im pressive com m unities of Cim arron, Lakeside an d V alley Forge 

Morton / S outhw est’s rapid climb to the top of building and developing in San Antonio? 
The leading firm here has a quick, simple answer to that question: San 
Antonians themselves. 
Two new series 
The other answers not only can be heard; they can be seen this weekend bv touring any of the fully furnished, professionally decorated model homes 
Morton / Southwest features iii three outstanding communities. 
Freedom Homes and Success Homes are shown in L akeside, located in southeastern Bexar County off U.S. 
Hwy. 87 outside S.E. Loop 41o; Valley 
F orge, off O'Connor Road between 
Nacogdoches Road and N E. Ill 35; and 
Cimarron, just south of N.E. FM 1oo4 east of Kitty Hawk Drive. 
The two series are aptly named, too. 
Freedom Homes are called that be­ cause they, literally, set buyers "free from rent" into a new world of home o w n ership. S u ccess H om es a re so named for the series' unique features that would make the purchase of any a certain success. 
Al to w a b ility '' is a key word for each seri e s. F re ed o m H om es are priced from as low as $28,5oo; Success, 
$34,ooo. No c o m p arab le hom es are built for those kind of prices these days; so. Morton/Southwest has a valid claim to leadership in San Antonio a r­ ea bousing. 
Morton / Southwest has drawn de­ signs from ingenious floor plans which have revolutionized the market for new homes by making them more afforda­ ble and more useful, square foot by square foot. Traffic patterns are ideal. 

Southwest. The ease is quite the con­ trary; they gain all they’ve ever want­ ed. 
Freedom Homes go far beyond the basics, too. They feature all the frill modern families have come to expect in a new home. This, indeed, is just one of the many reasons Freedom Homes have gained such popularity. 
Their three- and four-bedroom plans include two complete baths generally sought by home buyers today. All this is fig ured into an a ttra c tiv e ly affordable package in a price range families today can afford. A Freedom 
Home, in other words, is no "pearl of great price.” 
P antry kitchens feature the right kind of appliances to lessen the work­ load for to day’s h o m em aker. D ish­ washers. disposers, ranges, vent hoods and abundant cabinetry are provided in Freedom Homes. All appliances carry the reliable Magic Chef brand name. 
Other extras Morton / Southwest has made available in Freedom Homes are wall-to-wall closets with storage space extending all the way to the ceiling and sliding doors of panel designs, finished two-ear garages, utility and work a r­ eas, patios with sliding glass doors, clever blends of masonry and wood for striking exteriors, carpeting of buyers’ choices of colors and styles, Friedrich central air and heat system s and, in most, woodburning fireplaces. 
Success Homes vividly reveal that an enjoyable home rem ains the "g re a t 
American dream " and one that can be realized without great sacrifices. 

The large amounts of total square footage in the Success plans can be seen iii spacious family rooms, separ­ ate dining areas, large family rooms and sizeable living rooms. In fact, the patios for Success Homes are family sized 

Also included are large, decorative kitchens w hich boast space-saving b u ilt-in s like M agic Chef ra n g e s . 

 ovens, vent hoods, dishw ashers and stainless steel Waste King disposers. 
The scope of Success Homes, how­ ever, goes far beyond th e ir useful space. The luxury appointments add much to how they present more than the money’s worth. 
They include shag carpeting in liv­ ing rooms, m aster suites and hallways; p riv a c y fences; w oo d b u rn in g fire ­ places in family rooms; abundant ca­ 

 binetry in pantry kitchens; com part­ m ented c e ra m ic b a th s; w alk-in or w all-to-w all clo se ts; h a n d so m e paneling; carefully chosen wall fa­ brics; and beamed cathedral ceilings. 
Buyers can choose the colors and pat­ terns for carpets and wallcoverings. 
E ach hom e in th is in geniou sly planned series also features a utility area and a finished two-car garage. 
’ 
Lakeside is a neighborhood unique in 

 its recreational offerings. They rnchirfe a lake for boating and fishing, tennis courts, swimming pool and park area. 
School district is Fast Central. 
Valley Forge, also with a swimming pool and tennis courts, is in the North 
East School District. 
Cimarron, with access to a number of amenities like a swim club, .Seoul hut and playground, is in the Judson 
School District. 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday March 5 1977* 
Briarwick opening as popular lifestyle 

Briarwick, by 
Royal 
Crest Homes, is proving a popular lifestyle for fa­ milies seeking to set up their homesteads in north­ eastern 
Bexar 
County, beyond the reach of city taxes but within five min­ utes driving time to N.E. 
Loop 
41o via 
Wetmore 
Road. 
Several homes already have been sold, even before the grand 

 opening this weekend 
Briarwick sales representa­ tives Ed Richardson and Mor­ gan Alsobrooks report that the two most important single items new home buyers in Briarwick are looking for include North 
East District schools for their children and a location outside the city limits with no city taxes, thereby reducing monthly pay­ ments.

Education Committee of the Texas Association of 
Realtors and a member of the faculty for the 
T exas R ealto rs In s ti­ tute.''

LIKE THIS AD. 

I'm Buddy Burns. And frankly, 
I've never understood why some people are willing to pay $35o or more a month to live in an apartment. 
So I asked a few couples who rent apartments in San Antonio, and here's what they told me: "W e don't have much furniture, and we can't afford a home right now." 
You Don't Need Much Furniture. 
I was so surprised by the number of couples renting expensive apartments that I decided to de­ sign and build a home lust for them. I call it my Power Saver 
II K Series. These homes offer all the energy-efficiency advan­ tages of my original Power 
Saver* homes, plus something extra . . . built-in furniture. I've included built-in breakfast nooks, built-m bookcases, built- in guest beds and built-in seating storage. In some models, I've even included built-in over-and- under laundry closets with the washer and dryer included. 

But Can You Afford It? If you and your spouse have a com­ bined income of $16,ooo, you can afford a Burns Co. Power 
Saver II* home. A home that makes your apartment look dull by comparison. A home with spacious living areas, plush deep-pile carpet, furniture- finished paneling and cabinetry, arni a woodbuming fireplace. A big, bright "wife saver" kitchen with General Electric appliances and plenty of cabinet storage. 
Luxurious baths with marble vanities, and full size tubs. And an elegant master suite with walk-in closets and separate dressing area. 
Come See My Homes Today. 
Take a few minutes this after­ 

 noon to see my new Power 
Saver II® homes in The Great 
Northwest. W e'll give you an informal tour and answer any questions you might have about becoming a homeowner instead of a renter. For additional infor­ mation, call the area sales office 
(see map), or your realtor. You might even show this ad to your landlord. W ith all the money he's making off your rent check, he might want to invest in a 
Burns Co. Power Saver II® home himself! h i m s e l t ! ^ ^

Home vegetable garden plans require caution 

D o w n t o E a r t h 

Bv T E R R Y W ILBO URN 
COUNTY EXTENSION HORTICULTURIST 
With the price of food con­ stantly going up, home vegeta­ ble gardening is becoming more and more popular. March 15 is the magic date for planting your 
Spring garden here in San An­ tonio. 
Setting out transplants any earlier without protection runs a high risk of frost kill. Even seeds planted too early will not germinate and grow properly because of moderately cold soils. 
First off, choose the best available spot. In deciding where to plant your vegetable garden, keep in mind the following: 

(iOOl) SOIL — This you cannot con­ trol completely; but, you can, by fol­ lowing good procedures, modify the soils here in San Antonio to where they will be much easier to work and grow plants better. Adding sand to loosen th<> soil, gypsum, iron sulfate, compost 
(if available) and a complete fertilizer will improve even the poorest of soils to a point where good vegetables can be grown. 

L E V E L GROUND - 'Phis is good for growing vegetables It is easier to prepare, plant and irrigate than slop­ ing ground; however, a gentle slope to the south or southeast is preferable, as it will make the most of available sun­ shine. Run rows across the slope, not up and down. This keeps the soil from washing down during irrigation. 

W A TER S U P P L Y - Make sure that your garden is near a good water sup­ ply or can be reached easily by sprinkler attachments. 

ADEQUATE LIGHT - Do not plant vegetables where they will be shaded by trees, shrubs, walls or fences. They need maximal sunlight for the best growth. Trees and shrubs also take water and nutrients from the soil. 

PLANT N EAR HOUSE - Do this, if possible You will be more likely to use spare time for working in it if it is reached easily, and you need not carry tools back and forth over a long dis­ tance. 
Where your garden is large enough for power tools. Im* sure to have access to a road or driveway wide enough for moving the equipment. 
To get the most out of a small area, make a rough plan for vour garden, lf you use tractor cultivation, the width of the equipment will determine the distance between rows. 
Here are some arrangement ideas: 
•Plan for a small garden, well cared for, rather than for a large one which

 will be neglected. 
You may plant several crops in the same row if the distance between rows is about th** same. 
• Plant late crops in the same space where Spring crops already have been harvested. For example, tomatoes may follow radishes or cucumbers can be planted after spinach. 
•Plant tall crops, such as corn and pole beans, on one side of the garden. 
If possible, plant them on the north side of the garden where they will not shade the low-grow ing crops. 
Plant enough of each vegetable for the family’s needs but not more than you can use. You may wish to plant more of crops that store well than of those that must be eaten as soon as they art* ripe. You may also want to allow extra supplies for canning or freezing. 

Some plants — such as melons, sweet corn, potatoes and asparagus — take up quite a bit of room. You may have to plant less of some crops if you want several kinds of vegetables in a small garden. 
Some crops — such as radishes, greens, lettuce and the like — have short periods of yield. Plant those more than once during a season to provide a continuos supply. 
Many of your vegetables will grow from seeds right in your garden. For others, you can buy young plants from the nursery and set them out in your garden. These plants were started from seed, under sheltered nursery conditions, at an earlier time than you could safely plant the seed outdoors. 
The vegetables you most likely will buy as young plants for transplanting are: tomatoes, peppers, cabbage and eggplant. 
Some seed — such as corn, onion, parsley and parsnip — loses its v iabi­ lity after about one year. The seed of most other vegetables will be good for about three years. Some companies date their seed packets and may give germination percentages. It is some­ times more economical to buy seed known to keep up for several seasons iii larger amounts. Note date of purchase on the packets. Do not use any seed for more than two or three years. Store any leftover seed in a cool, dry place or place it in a container with silica gel and then seal it. 
Planting recommended varieties of vegetables is one of the best things a gardener can do to have a successful garden. Next week’s column will be devoted to listing vegetables that can be grown in the Spring garden and varieties of each that are recommend­ ed for this area.

Energy expert blam es crisis on Congress 

By SARA MARTIN LZ lf the Soviet Union wanted to invade the United States, F e ­ bruary 1977, would have been the ideal time, a noted energy authority said Friday night. 
“ The United States would have been on its knees because of the energy crisis.*' said Dr. .John .1. M cKetta, chemical engineering professor at the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
McKetta. chairman of the National 
Energy Policy Committee during the 
Nixon adm inistration, presented the first lecture in a series of five spon­ sored by St 
M a r y 's U n iv ersity 
Division of Engineering. 
“ In 197(1. we recommended to Presi­ dent Nixon to step up coal production to hit a new high bv 1976 and triple the amount of coal by 1985," McKetta said 
“ Congress wanted to help so they gave us the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the m ine-safety a c t .” 
McKetta said. 
“ W hat H a p p e n e d ? ” he asked. 
“ Twenty two per cent of the mines were closed because they could not meet EPA standards.” 
Switched to oil 
People could no longer use coal so they switched to oil. the product facing extreme shortage. McKetta said. 
“ My topic is a sad topic." MeKetla said. “ In the energy field. Congress has m ade rules ag ain st our own team ." 
• “ They put us in such a position that there is no way to have energy self- sufficiency the rest of your life, your c h ild re n ’s life and your c h ild re n 's children’s life.” he said 
“ We have kept these rules too long.” be said. “ Dropping them now won t accomplish anything. You are through with luxurious use of energy." 
McKetta said the energy crisis was the biggest threat facing Americans. 
“ It is a time clock licking away in­ side America.” he said. “ People are afraid to admit. Congress is even more afraid because it is their fault and they don't want to be voted out of office.

Youth held in kidnap o f officers 
KINGSVILLE (AP) - A 14-year- old youth was in custody Friday night alter allegedly abducting two Kings­ ville policemen and forcing them to drive to nearby Bishop before releas­ ing them unharmed, officials said. 
Authorities said the boy. who police said had a long record as a juvenile offender, was escorted to the Kleberg 
County Courthouse bv his attorney, stale Rep. Irma Rangel. D-Kmgsv die. 
Investigators gave the following ac­ count: 
Two K ingsville police o ffic e rs slopped the youth iii Kingsville after receiving calls that a bov iii a neigh­ borhood was knocking on doors. When the officers approached the youth, he pulled a gun on them. 
Disarmed 
The boy disarm ed the one officer with a gun. The policemen were then ordered to drive north to Bishop, a small community about eight miles north of Kingsv ille in South Texas. 
Several shots were fired by the boy during the drive. The commandeered police car was followed by sev eral other police vehicles. 
The car with the youth slopped near 
Bishop and the boy escaped into the brush. A search b> about HH law j enforcement officers failed lo locate I the youth. 
Police said no one was injured dur­ ing the incident. 
Officials said no charges were filed immediately against the .south a lth ­ ough juvenile delinquency proceedings were expected to begin concerning the boy MonUav. 
Woman jailed in gun death 

A San Antonio woman rem ained jailed Friday following a shooting incident that left a 3o-year-old man dead. 
The victim, Armando P. Apolinar of 
2596 S. (leo. McMullen Drive, died 
Thursday night after being shot in the neck while in the parking lot of a lounge in tin* iou block of the New 
Laredo Highway, police said 
Charged with murder is Celia San­ chez, 22, of 314 Lovett Ave She was lulled in lieu ol a Sin.(NHI bood sot bv

3 die when they drive off bridge 

SHILOH, Tent! (AP) — The middle section of a bridge collapsed during 
(he night, causing the death of three persons who unwittingly drove off it in the dark early Friday, officials said. 
A fourth person drove his Volks­ wagen off the bridge bul extricated hansel! from his partially submerged car in Owl Creek, near the field where i nurn troops and Confederates fought the Battle of Shiloh in 1862 

'In the e n e rg y fie ld, C o n g re ss has m a d e rules a g a in st o u r 

 o w n ten m ' 

“ All th is js going on while we are sittin g on Vast am o u n ts of energy sources. We should be producing and using these sources." 
McKetta blamed the situation on the short-sightedness and lethargy of Con­ gress. 
“ P re ssu re from zero-pollutholists was so persistent, Congress made all tin' ru les against the en erg y p ro ­ ducers.’’ McKetta said 
“ The inept inactiv tty of Congress is a tragic exam ple of bad governm ent. 
Politicians have put the entire world’s future in jeopardy just to serve their own political purposes. 
"This is treason,” he said. 
McKetta said the United States im­ ported $:17 billion in oil and gas from other countries. In 1977. thus far. the 
United States is operating at a 15 per cent higher rate. 
“ T his is a p o tential d is a s te r ,” 
McKetta said “ We cannot afford to pay this much for energy. 
“ How did the most powerful and af­ fluent country get into this situation? It wasn’t easy. 
“ It took a lot of m aneuvering by congressmen to get us into it. They came tip with senseless regulations to meet the demands of extrem e envir­ onmentalists." McKetta said 
Pioneer 
Although the United States was a pioneer in the development ol the nu­ clear reactor, ii takes at least ll years to build one, lie said. 
“ It takes four y e a r s i i i ,Japan aud four and a half in France. Why? En­ vironmental rules and regulations.” 
McKetta said 
McKetta said nuclear radiation was dangerous, as dangerous as gasoline. one of the most volatile and flammable substances. 
“ But we have learned to respect it." he said. "Many things are dangerous, but reasonable people will take mo­ derate risks if the benefits are high. 
“ The (Milicy makers must learn the world is risky. They should not go bv whether the product is IOO per cent 

 safe, but w hether the benefits are worth the risk.” he said. 
McKetta said Americans are using natural gas faster than it can be pro­ duced. and producing it faster that it can be found. 
“ And tin' oil situ atio n is even worse,” he said 
Reason necessary 
Am ericans have to be reasonable about env ironmental demands, cut out senseless, inflexible regulations, re- tii? ii to a free enterprise system and find and use energy of all kinds. 

He also said Americans had to re ­ move catalytic converters from cars, cut out large cars, retain the 55 miles per hour speed limit and cut out air conditioning in cars. 
“ These will be laws in 1989 if you d o n ’t do them v o lu n ta rily now ,” 
McKetta said. 
“ We didn t conserve much energy in 
1976. You sure can use energy, but tinw­ are you at producing it?”

D octor says defendant incom petent for trial 

A doctor testified iii federal court 
Friday a man, who is lacing federal charges for aiding and abetting the escape of a drug prisoner, is mentally incompetent lo stand trial. 
C S Chief Bist .Judge Adian Spears held all legal proceedings on Miguel 
Perez Rodriguez in abeyance. 
But, the judge authorized federal officials to work with state officials ty get Rodriguez committed to a state hospital. 
Dr John (I. Sparks of Wilford Hall 
I SAC Medical Center testified Rodri­ guez is not presently competent to 

 stand trial. 
Dr. Sparks said Rodriguez’s condi­ tion could probably be improved with medical treatment. 
Rodriguez was indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges of aiding Robert M artinez-Ram os's e s­ cape from Bexar County Jail. 
M artinez-R am o s, who was being held in Bexar County Jail on charges of conspiracy lo possess heroin, allegedly posed as Rodriguez to escape jail. 
Police said Martinez-ttamos told de­ tention officers he was Miguel Perez 
Rodriguez, and his bond for a burg­ 

 lary charge had been posted when he escaped jail in early December. 
He allegedly gave officers R od ri­ guez's address, signature and date of birth before leaving the jail. 
Mart inez-Ramos, who was charged with conspiracy to jwissess almost one pound of heroin, was still at large F ri­ day, according to federal officials. 
Rodriguez, meanwhile, is being held in Bexar County Jail in lieu of a $5o,ooo bond. 
In addition to the federal charges of aiding and abetting. Rodriguez is lac­ ing state charges for burglary 

U.S. may talk with 
Cuba on fishing 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of 
State Cyrus R Vance said Friday that the United States expects to have dir­ ect talks with Cuba in the near future on questions arising from their mutual claim s to fishing ju risd ic tio n s 2o9 miles seaward. 
There have been no d ire c t talk s between the two countries in 16 years and no substantive negotiation since 
1973 when the U.S.-Cuban antihijack- ing agreement was worked out w ith the help of intermediaries. 
At a news conference, Vance also expressed support for a proposal by 
Cuban leader Fidel Castro that the two countries exchange visits by athletic teams. In late 1975. former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger vetoed a proposal under which a U.S. all-star baseball team would compete against a 
Cuban team in Havana. 
Uganda 
Questioned about reports of Cuban personnel in Uganda, Vance said he has been unable to confirm through official channels the presence of any large n u m b e rs of C ubans in that country but he could not rule out a token Cuban involvement there. 
The United States and Cuba both imposed 2o9-mile fishing jurisdictions this week. As an interim measure, the 
United States unilaterally set a m a ri­ tim e boundary to a point about half-way — or 45 m iles — between 
F lo rid a 's southern tip and C u b a 's north coast. 
Officials said the maritime boundary question would be taken up in bilateral discussions. 
A few days after the C a rte r took office, the State Department said Cuba had expressed interest in discussions on the fishing question. The United 
States replied affirm atively to the 
Cuban proposal about two weeks ago but until now, no adm inistration of­ ficial had given any indication the dis­ cussions would take place face to face. 
Tilt' Swiss Embassy handles U.S. in­ terests in Havana and the Czech E m ­ bassy in Washington carries out the same function for the Cubans. 
Within the next two weeks, the ad­ ministration will make a decision on w hether to extend re s tr ic tio n s on travel by Americans to Cuba. The res­ trictions have been renewed every six months since the early t9Bos, and the expiration date on the latest order is 
March 18. 
Vance said there are no precondi­ tions to bilateral talks but noted that 
President Curter has listed as precon­ ditions for friendly relations an easing of political repression in Cuba. 
Court orders reunion for deaf-m ute couple 

J A M E S H O M E R after he g o t his scalp back 

Hector and Leonor Cortez, a deaf-m ute couple separated since February, are together again — with a little help from 
Cupid. 
Cupid, in this case 131st D istrict 
Court Judge Fred Shannon, has o r­ dered Mrs. Cortez’ family not to inter­ fere in the couple s lives. 
Cortez alleged his m other-in-law , 
Mrs. Maria IL Escobedo, kidnaped his wife and daughter. In un effort to get his wife buck. Cortez filed a lawsuit against M rs. E scobedo and o thers charging family influence. 
Hector and Leonor have been m a r­ ried for eight y e a rs and have a 
6-year-old daughter and a 4->ear-old son. The children are not handicapped. 
Mother testifies 

In court Thursday. Mrs. Escobedo testified her daughter, using sign lan­ guage, told her two brothers Cortez was mistreating her. 
But, Mrs. Escobedo testified her daughter never complained to her of her husband’s alleged abuse. 
Through a court interpreter. Shan­ non sought to ascertain whether Mrs 
Cortez wanted to live with her husband or lier mother. 
But they failed to reach an answer 

 because of a difference in the sign language between the interpreter and 
Mrs. Cortez. 
F inally, the ju d g e o rd ered Mrs. 
Cortez, who is gradually losing her sight, to stand between her mother and 

 her husband. 
Shannon, through the court in te r­ preter. told Mrs. Cortez to indicate whom she preferred to live with. She pointed to lier husband and the couple embraced. 
Floridian quizzed in probe o f death 

Vian lost his scalp but doctors sewed it back 

SAN FRANCISCO (A P) - A long­ haired California man has become the first person in the country to lose his scalp and then have it replaced in tedious, m icroscope-aided su rg e ry , doctors say. 
Jam es Homer, 26, a chef in Santa 
Cruz. had craw led under an idling truck arid hts 24-inch h a ir becam e caught i i i lite spinning drive shaft, lits scalp was ripped aff completely just from just above his evebrtms and ta rs

( enter here bari Homer on the operat­ ing table lur more than 17 hours last 
Thursday and uccessfully matched up the blood vessels from Ins scalp aud skull through the use of su rg ic a l microscopes and thread thinner than an eye lash 
Dr. Isabelle Richmond, spokesman tor the six surgeons who performed the operation, said Friday that connecting the blood vessels proved the m ost tedious procedure. 
“ Have you ever seen wet spagetti wtien i f s kind of overcooked?” she said. “ Ifs jus! hard to work with at 3 

 in the morning when it keeps slipping from your grasp and your Ila lids start shaking.” 
Surgeons worked iii teams, she said, sleeping between stints. 

Skull fracture

He was in surgery at 4 p m,, more than five hours after the mishap.

After surgery, Homer was in inten­ sive care for several days. The hospital said he probably will be released iii about a week.

By EVE LYNN SAWYER 

The love bug bit the three sons of the Douglas 
Lewises alm ost at the same time. 
Douglas Lewis Jr. m a rrie d Marian Obcn- chain in December. 

Tom Lewis will marry Lyn­ da Welch this Saturday even­ ing and 
David Lewis and 
Jenny Ray will become hus­ band and wife next Saturday. 

With all the festivities. Mrs. 
Lewis almost feels like a bride herself. 
The u ltim a te prenuptial party was given to honor Lynda Welch and Tom 
Lewis Thursday night in La 
Provence. 
This is the elegant French restaurant that Joe Paesano is 

 going to open very soon in a two-story home behind his Ita­ lian restaurant. 
Distinctive 
The black tie party-goers got a real preview of the lavish decor in the three distinctive dining room s, the brown leather and smoky mirror in the walnut bar, and the good. 
The parents of the bride, Mr. and Mrs. Doyle Welch intro­ duced the guests who were un­ acquainted. F o rm e r San An­ tonians, Joy and Harry Miller c a m e from Salt Lake City, where they have lived for the past 14 years. 
Brian and Maureen McCabe attended from New York City, where he is a Wall Street lawyer with the firm in which farmer president Richard Nix­ on and John Mitchell used to practice law. 
The young couple live on 

Roosevelt Island in the middle of the East River and commute to M a n h a tta n on an. aerial tramway. Neither cars (nor dogs) are allowed in this deve­ lopment built in the past two years. The 
McCabes don’t miss owning a car and thor­ oughly enjoy their lifestyle. 
Parents 
T h e y ’ve been visiting her parents Mr. and Mrs. Arthur 
Grothues and his. Mrs. Ruth 
McCabe and Jerry McCabe. 
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Moore enioved his grandson’s prenup­ tial party as much as anyone. 
Mrs. Moore looked striking, as always, in a gray chiffon gown cut with a square neckline. 
Mr. and Mrs. George Billings are looking forward to a visit in 
Pinetop, N.M., with the Doyle 
Welches. 
The foursome will play golf. 
Besides the traditional wed- ding toasts to the engaged eou- 

 ple, Robert L. Kirkwood sang them a wish for happiness. In the midst of all the impromptu speeches, dinner was served. 

Lump crabmeat cocktail with rod sauce was in crystal, fish­ shaped salad plates. Then came a white fish, double sole, topped with white wine and mushroom sauce. 
Beef tenderloin with bernaise sauce, p o m m e d a u p h in e , broiled tomato slice with par­ mesan. artichoke bottom, wa­ tercress and a side dish of broccoli came next. 
The meal lasted for three leisurely hours. 
What is the mother of the three grooms going to do once all the marriages have been held? The Douglas Lewises Jr. are moving to Australia next month, and he will work on his 
Ph. I), in anthropology’ there. 
That could be a whole new pro­ ject.

“ It’s a new age and a different work; you’ve got to think with it,” says

Spirits high during lunch at wine shop 

THIS OFFER IS BEING MADE FOR A LIMITED TIME THROUGH PARTICIPATING DEALERS 

In mythology, followers of 
Bacchus (a title for Dionysus, god of wine) performed such miracles as causing fountains of milk and wine to spring up. 
In modern San Antonio, his followers have an even more delicious w ay of celebrating this “ promoter of civiliza­ tion and lover of peace. “ 
They have lunch in a wine shop! 
The wine shop is Bacchus and Co. at 
5oo3 Broadway, owned by .lose 
Gonzalez and Frank Coleman. 
“ When we first opened.” explains 
Gonzalez, “ we had a section in the back for tasting so we had to have a restaurant license. We thought the idea of eating in a wine shop was kind of unique, and the restaurant evolved from that.” 
Hours 
Bacchus is open from ll a.rn. to H p.m. Monday through Saturday and ll a.m. to 111 p.m. on Fridays. Food is served from 11:3o a.m. to 4 p.m. Mon­ day through Saturday and 6 to 111 p.m. on Fridays. 
The menu is limited to sandwiches, salads, quiche, cheese plate, soft drinks, wines and ll different import­ ed beers. 
On Friday nights, a soup is added—either vegetable or lentil—for 
95 cents per serving. 
I ve tasted the pastrami sandwich 
(ham, corned beef, roast beef and turkey also available) for $1.o5. Cheese can be added for 2o cents extra. 
I ve also had two kinds of quiche—the classic Swiss cheese and ham and also one with fresh mushrooms— for $1 a slice or SI.5o with tossed green salad. 
Both of these were very good. In fact, the only thing I tasted that I did not care for was the potato salad (tuna and chicken also available for 65 cents per serving) which seemed too sweet and too moist. 
My very favorites, though, are sand­ wiches made with fresh mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese ($1.65) and the Kolbase ( Polish sausage) and 
Sw iss cheese ($1.85). 
All sandwiches can be ordered on light or dark rolls. 
“ The mushroom and Swiss cheese." says Gonzalez, “ has become the ‘store item’ “ 
For a beverage with mine, he stig- gested Moisten beer, a light German variety. Beer ranges from 5o cents a

 bottle for Mexican brews to SO cents for the Europeans.. 
The same day, my husband ordered the cheese plate that includes three cheeses, apple slices, bread and olives. 
($1.5o) with a glass of rose (45 cents). 
Wines offered by the glass include a medium dry and dry white, a medium red and a fruity (usually Portuguese) rose. 
“ But a lot of times,” says Gonzalez, 
“ people buy a bottle of wine—we have chilled ones, too — and we’ll open it for them and they’ll buy a cheese plate.” 
A native of Dallas, Gonzalez spent, most of his growing up years in Spain before coming to San Antonio to attend 
St. Mary’s University. 
He earned a bachelor of arts in poli­ tical science and was working on a master’s degree when he met Coleman and formed the partnership. 
“ We’re the ‘and company’ in the shop’s num(V’ 
Three years 
Bacchus and Co. first opened in Vil­ lage Plaza, moving to the Broadway location three years ago—then adding the food a year and a half ago. 
Gonzalez, who does the cooking, also is the wine merchant. 
“ I acquired my appreciation for wine when I was living in Europe,” he says, 
“ but I ve really learned about wines by tasting and reading and talking to importers.” 
Tasting is the best educational source, he notes, because customers ask for wines by the way they taste—medium dry or slightly sweet. for example. 
Bacchus and Co. is a cozy little shop decorated with flags from the major countries whose wines are carried— 
France, Germany, Italy, PKORTUGAL 
ANI) Spain plus California. 
“ We’ve tried to create a comfortable atmosphere that’s hassle free—whether you’re reading or eating or browsing,” says Gonzalez. 
“ Also as close an atmosphere as we* could get to the things we've seen in 
Europe."

Big step reported in nuclear fission 

By BILL CUNNINGHAM 

EXPRESS-NEWS AGRICULTURE EDITOR 

Peanut cheese on the pizza or on a casserole may be a new develop­ ment in American eating habits. 
Information on the re­ search on cheese involv­ ing use of peanut protein was given by Dr. Karl 
Mattil, professor of food production research at 
Texas A&M University, at a m eeting of key leaders of the Texas peanut industry Friday at the Holiday Inn North­ west . 
Dr. 
Mattil told members of the Texas 
Peanut Producers Board and other growers about the cheese made from 

 eassein and peanut protein. 
He showed slides of the casserole and pizza, adding that both were eaten as soon as the slides were made. 
C onsumption of cheese has more than doubled in: the last 15 years, and giant corporations of the food industry are doing! research on imitation cheeses because they have a fear of a possible shortage of milk in the future. 
Dr. Mattil said the No­ vem ber 1976 issue of 
Food Processing Maga­ zine pointed out some of the reeearch work in a feature story on imitation cheeses. 

About 25 scientists from the Texas Agricul­ tural Extension Service 
Experiment Station and more than a dozen Ex­ tension Service specia- 

 phenville gave progress reports on various phases of peanut production. 
Wayne Eaves, Gor­ man. executive secretary of the Texas Peanut Pro­ lists from College S t a - ’facers Board, was mas- lion, Yoakum and Ste- ter of ceremonies^

LOS a l a m o s ; N.M. 
(AP) — Los Alamos 
Scientific Laboratory says it has made a major advance in one method being tested to produce nuclear fusion, a poten­ tially inexhaustable source of energy. 
A spokesman said laboratory scientists have produced the world’s first thermonu­ clear fusion reaction generated by a carbon dioxide laser. The reac­ tion lasted several hundred picaseconds — very small fractions of a second. 
The Energy Research and Development Ad­ ministration in Washing­ ton said “ these results 
Police officer injured 

A San Antonio police officer was injured dur­ ing a struggle inside a 
South Side residence 
Friday night, police said. 
Police said the officer, 
Dale Hancock, 28, was answering a disturbance call in the 2oo block of 
Aekard Place shortly be­ fore IO p.m. when he ob­ served a van pulling away from the residence at a high rate of speed. 
Hancock chased the van around the block iii his patrol car. The van then was driven to the rear driveway of the re­ sidence and the officer chased the driver inside the house, police said, 
Once inside, police said, the two grappled with each other. 
A suspect was appre­ hended soon after the in­ cident by other officers, police reported. 
Hancock was reported in undetermined condi­ tion at Southeast Baptist 
Hospital with leg injuries late Friday. 
The suspect did not re­ quire hospitalization, po­ lice said.

 indicate important pro­ gress toward the goals of laser fusion for long-term energy production.’’ 
But the agency said other ERDA fusion re ­ search using glass crys­ tal lasers instead of gas previously produced longer fusion reactions with greater energy out­ puts m easured in the amounts of neutron par­ ticles produced. 

Continuing 

“ Continued research will be needed for many years, however, since both neutron outputs a billion times higher and extensive engineering development are necces- sary for useful energy production,” an ERDA spokesman said. 
Fusion is the creation of energy by uniting atomic nuclei, in this case triggered when iso­ tope forms of the hy­ drogen culled deuterium and tritium were bom­ barded by the lab’s two- beam carbon dioxide laser. 
The laser is the largest and most powerful of its kind in the world. A laser is a device that generates powerful light pulses which can then be beamed at atomic parti­ cles.

Now you can have a beautiful green lawn 

 without work or worry thanks to liquid fertilizers applied by a-PeriiM)*(ireen. 

A greener lawn is what you'll notice first— usually within IO to 14 days atter we first spray your lawn. 
It will be greener because it is healthier. Greener because a-Perm -o-Green’s nutrients are promoting a deep root system and strong stems and blades. 
You’ll notice something else too, no chinch bug or grub worm problems because a-Perm-o-Green applies the correct insecticide at the right tim e— before damage is done. 
Join the thousands who are enjoying greener, healthier lawns thanks to a-Perm-o-Green applica­ tions last year. Your satisfaction is assured or you don’t owe us a cent. 

Why is a-Perm-o-Green so effective? 

Your lawn is sprayed with liquid fertilizer specially prepared by a-Perm-o-Green to meet current soil, temperature and moisture conditions. 
Nutritional elements plus nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are seasonally adjusted to promote the growth most beneficial at the time of application. 
Research proves that proper nutrition— rather than the soil itself— makes the difference between success and failure in creating a beautiful lawn. And creating beautiful lawns is what a-Perm-o-Green is all about 

Average Cost? Less than $2o per application. 

Seems amazingly low, but a-Perm-a-Green is able to buy fertilizers and insecticides in quantity and pass the savings on to you. The average size lawn really 

 does average less than $2o per application— about the same as if you bought materials and applied them yourself (not counting the trips you’d make lo the fertilizer store, the time and gamble over the correct mix to use, and the spreader equipment you’d have to rent or buy!) 

W hen do you join the program? Now! 

Over the next few weeks our lawn care profes­ sionals will take the a-Perm-o-Green trucks out to spray this year’s first treatments on lawns throughout this area. 
Make sure your home is one of our first stops. Call us right now! 

 a-Perm-o-Green 
Lawn Spraying Schedule 

Spring: BaJanceu application in­ cludes nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and M kro-N utrknts to give sour lawn a strong, green leaf and stem. 
Early Summer: Another bal­ anced application of fertilizers plus insecticides for control of grub worms, chinch bugs, and other pests. 
Summer: Hot weather nutrients iii seasonally balanced applica­ tion plus insec ticides inned at second generation chinch bugs. fall: Essential nutrients plus a winterizing application to pro­ mote deep root growth and a helpful fungicide.

Photo lifts veil from '7 8 vehicle 

I suppose it's progress, but sneaky photographers have just about taken all of the mystery out of the annual new ear introductions 
— we already have a picture of the 
1978 Monte Carlo. 
There was a time, not so long ago. when the auto makers went to great trouble to keep the new models secret until show­ room day. I can remember seeing tran­ sport trucks on the highways with the new models on board, but covered with tar­ paulins. And they were usually unloaded at night. 
There would occasionally appear in the buff magazines some artist’s drawings of the new models well in advance of show time. They were obviously drawn from photographs of the real things, or perhaps in some cases the artist had been given a look at the prototypes. 
Anyway here we are in March, with the 
1978 models not due until September, and we can look at a pretty good photo of a 
1978 model. This photo of the Chevy Monte 
Carlo was taken at the GM proving grounds in Mesa. Ari/. 
We know that the car will be built on a shorter wheelbase, reduced eight inches from 118 to 1o8 inches. That puts the 
Monte Carlo into the compact size for most peoples way of thinking. 
It’s always nice to be in on a secret, perhaps get a quick look at one of these prototypes being driven along some back road, but for pictures to be splashed across the nation just doesn t seem right. 
Anyway here is the picture; take a good look, it s almost 1978.

If you think traffic congestion in cities is something new, that it only came about with the advent of the automobile, not so. 
It seems the eternal city. Rome, has had traffic problems since before Christ. 
Julius Caesar became so upset over the congestion in Rome in 44 B.C. that he 

CHEVROLET’S M onte Carlo for built on a shorter w heelbase —- buyers consider compact 

 ordered that no wheeled vehicles whatso­ ever would be allowed within the pre­ cincts of the city again. 
Well, old Julius’ order did not withstand the test of time. Since then, through the 
Caesars, various popes, the dictator 
Mussolini, the Christain Democrats and now the Communist-Socialists, the traffic problems of Rome have been unsolved. 
Best idea 
Looking back at Julius’ order to ban wheeled vehicles, the city managers of 
Rome think he had the best idea. How can you have traffic congestion if there is no traffic? 
Rome’s little narrow streets, some of them paved in pagan times, are not fit to handle the one million cars a day that drive around Rome. 
So now another historic part of the city has been put off-limits to cars. The area of the right hank of the Tiber River has been closed to traffic, and only those who live in the area are permitted to drive autos in the zone. 
The area includes the Piazza and the square of Campo Dei Fiori, both popular tourist attractions. With the latest move the area closed to traffic in the heart of 
Rome is about 4(1o acres, or about 4o per cent of what is called the “ historic center.” 
In two thousand years Rome has not solved its traffic problems, it seems unli­ kely the solution will be found in banning more and more zones to cars, but I can’t

• putting it into the size m ost car 

By JIM ABBOTT 
AUTO EDITO# 
We don't usually do a Road Re­ port on a used ear. but this one was irresistible — an Alta Romeo 
Montreal. 
The car is one of the unique vehicles of the world; certainly a prime example of the Italian automobile art. 
In Italy, automobiles are considered works of art — sometimes. 
The car is rare because it was a limited production run; it is believed only 3o were built. This is the only one in the state of 
Texas. There are two in San Francisco and one in Las Vegas. So it really qua­ lifies as a rare bird. 
The car is currently owned by Frank 
Broughton of Broughton Motors, 213o 
Austin Highway. 
A m bassad or’s car 
Broughton acquired the car when tho talian ambassador to Mexico was truns- 
.ered to another country and could not take the car with him. Tears were ac­ tually shed by the ambassador’s wife when tho deal was finally made. 
I would cry. too. if I had to give up a

Mission City Imports named dealer lor Saab 

Mission City Imports, Inc . 382o San 
Pedro Ave., has been appointed a dealer for the Swedish-built Saab cars. 

The new dealership is headed by Ber­ nard E. Forsythe who has 38 years ex- oerience in the automobile business. 28 of those years with General Motors. A. W. 
Wilbur, vice president, has 18 years experience in foreign automotive. The sales, service and parts departments employees have an,average of 18 years experience in the automotive field. 
For 1977. Saab will offer two-, three

 four- and five-door models 
New in line for 1977 is the five-door model, a roomy four-door with an addi­ tional large rear hatch extending all the way down to the bumper. 
In addition, the 1977 models include new front parking lights and direc tion indica­ tors which also in some models include1 a front-mounted side-guidance reversing light. On the two- and four-door models the rear lights have been redesigned to more than double the previous light area. 
All 1977 models are available at Mission 
I City Imports. 

 magnificent automobile like the Mon­ treal. Words cannot describe the exper­ ience that occurs when you accelerate away in first gear. It is as many would say today, “ a happening.” 
The exhaust note1 is sure to fall plea­ santly upon the enthusiast’s ear. ll gives out that unforgettable rumble ot a purebred racing engine at idle, the rumble that says quit fooling around ana let s get going. The engine roars like1 a lion under acceleration, but Durrs like a kitten while cruising. 
Scared jack rabbit 
The get-away of the car can best be compared to a scared jack rabbit who has just discovered he is being chased by a hound. The rabbit knows he has got to outrun the hound, or else. 
Shifting the five-speed gearbox takes a 
.bit nf getting used to. There is no worry about shifting into reverse accidentally, but th*' difference between third and fifth is minimal; and you just may go into third when you really want fifth. 
The' Montreal handles as a purebred sports car should. 
Cornering is very flat indeed, the sus­ pension is very tight, steering response at speed is immediate. The steering is a little heavy if you are parking, but once the car is moving it is light enough to suit anyone. 
Memories 
The Montreal is a car that will bring back pleasant memories to anyone who remembers the days of the muscle cars. A drive in the car will rekindle that burning desire to go out and find a long empty road to conquer. 
The big wide Michelin NAS radials grip the road like they were coated with 
Elmer’s glue. There is a feeling of neutral steering, but it is easy to bring the rear end out with a tap of the accelerator into oversteer, and a twitch of the wheel will brine it back

...... 

This is not a car I would care to drive in everyday traffic. 
I had the miserable feeling in the bot­ tom of my stomach — all the time I was driving — that everyone was trying to scrape the paint off Hie fenders. That was int true but it is the feeling you get ’iii a me of a kind automobile' 
The truth is that the Montreal is not a iraetieal automobile at all. There is a nack seat, but it is a joke — only good for luggage, very small children or dogs. 
The front seats are comfortable enough 
— plenty of leg room, enough head room for my over six-foot frame. The steering wheel is built for a real driver. The in­ struments are all right there, but they are 
Italian, and the speedometer and odo­ meter are in kilometers. 
There are more than enough creature comforts — factory-installed aircondi­ tioning. AM/FM stereo radio with eight- track tape player, electric window lifts and on and on. The horn on the Montreal reminds me of a two-tone gin whistle. It is. in fact, a two-tone horn with a switch that changes it into a single tone for city driving. 
The Alfa Romeo Montreal develops its incredible performance from the 288b cc overhead cain V-8 engine. The little mill cranks out a believable 23o SAE horse- 
|M>wer. Put that much raw power into a vehicle that weighs under 2.8oo pounds, and you can see where all the excitement comes from. 
The power to weight ratio, the very good aerodynamics and suspension just have to deliver on the car's promises. 
Who would want such a car? 
For one thing the person would have to be very rich — the Italians do not part with their works of art for peanuts. 
The owner would have to have a desire to drive something that no one else has, would have to appreciate a fine car, be a

The people who are fighting to get other people to use public transit are losing the battle all across the country, lf you go> back to the 197o census, and compare it to the 1975 surve y, the n u m be r of com ­ muters going to work on public transit dropped by 21 per cent. 
In te re s tin g ly enough, the sam pled m etro areas w ith m ajor public transit networks — Chicago, P hiladelphia and

LO S A N G E LE S t i m e s SERVICE 
After taking a hard, serious look at the runaway success of Honda automobiles in the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is likely to introduce a sm all car by 1989 w iih a stratified charge engine and styling si­ m ila r to H onda’s A ccord, in d u s try sources say. 
The No. 2 U.S. auto maker previously acquired the rights to Honda's CVCC, or stratified charge engine in this country, but it has not publicly announced any production plans. 
One company source, however, said he expects the engine to be ready for use in at le a s t a few 1979 models, “ or 1989 at the la te s t 
Other sources indicate Ford has decid­ ed to use the Accord as the concept for its new car, which may be a new version ol the Mustang 
The stratified charge engine, pioneered by Honda, uses a small, extra combustion chamber at the top of each cylinder to 

 burn a fairly rich fuel-air m ixture. Then the charge is burned again in a m ain combustion chamber, which reduces pol­ lution and has given Honda cars a repu­ tation for extremely good fuel economy. 
Honda sold 159.929 cars in the U.S. just year — more than triple its 1974 total. It has forecast sales of up to 299,oo9 cars this year. 

 i t i t i t 

General Motors Corp. w ill introduce a diesel engine as an option of 1978-model 
Oldsmobile 88s and 98s and two pickup truck models, according to GM Chairman 
Thomas A. Murphy. 
GM previously had indicated it would use the new small diesel engine on at least one Oldsmobile model, but had not iden­ tified it. 
Murphy, at a press conference to open the Chicago Auto Show, said the diesels would be available at the beginning of the 
1978 model year — which starts in late 
September 

He said he did not dispute published a sim ilar gasoline engine the diesel w ill reports that the company would equip up cost. to 199.o99 vehicles w ith the new diesel powerplant, which w ill be built in Lans­ ing. M id i. 
B e tte r fu el econ o m y 

Murphy said current tests indicate the 

The U.S. Department of Transportation has recommended that auto makers be given a y e a r’s delay in m eeting its toughest re q u ire m e n t fo r im proved bum hers. m i 
Last year 'tic departm ent issued a diesel engine gets about 25 per cent better two-stage requirement for new bumpers fuel economy than a comparable gasoline engine. 
Ile warned, however, that unless Con­ gress passes legislation easing the s tiff pollution lim its which future cars must meet the diesel engine w ill be eliminated. 
GM has previously said that because the diesel operates at a higher temperature it is much more difficult to reduce the en­ gine's emissions of nitrogen oxides. 
A spokesman said GM plans to certify the small diesel powerplant to meet Cali­ fornia’s tougher pollution lim its. 
Ile declined to say how much more than 

 beginning with the 1979-model cars. 
The 1979s w ill still be required to have bumpers that w ill prevent all damage to cars — except for the bum pers them ­ selves — in front or rear crashes up to 5 m p h and corner impacts up to 3 m p h. 
But the requirement that 1989s elim in­ ate any m a jo r dam age even to the bumpers in low-speed crashes would be delayed until 1981. under the DOT's new proposal 
DOT w ill issue a final ru lin g on its proposal after a public hearing later this vear.
