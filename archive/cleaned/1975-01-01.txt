Oscar baby makes it 

Coastal States dril- lionaire Oscar Wyatt and his stunning superclotheshorse wife Lynn are not exactly slum m ing this New Year’s Day. 

They’re spending it with a select handful of the world’s m o re beautiful people in a s k y h i g h villa overlooking 
Acapulco Bay, Mexico. 
The W y atts are house guests of Jack Haley Jr. and his recen t bride, Liza M in­ nelli, the star of Cabaret and an upcoming Hollywood m u ­ sical blockbuster. 

Among others collected for the occasion in the posh Haley villa by the bay: V incente 
Minnelli, Liza’s movie direc­ tor dad. and Mr. and M rs. 
G eo rg e 
H am ilton. 
You rem em ber George, film idol who once dated Linda Bird 
Johnson. 

1'he Wyatts flew to Acapul­ co a few days back in O scar’s private jet. As 1975 dawns, the rich and socially on-the-make 
Houston couple have reached their absolute zenith. 
Net profits of Coastal States shot to an all-time high in the year just ended; no one in of­ ficial Texas circles appears ready to put O scar’s feet to the fire in connection with his ru p tu red gas c o n tra c ts , i n ­ cluding one with San Antonio; and... well... as m en tio n e d , 
O scar and L y n n a re dow n there in Acapulco en joying the fruits of it all.

Federal raps 
And look for m id-January federal indictments involving some hairy charges against a gaggle of well-known local business and professional men. 
One charge has to do with tr a n s p o r tin g San A ntonio suckers, or lull guys, out to 
Las Vegas for delivery into the hands of poker cheats, also from San Antonio. 
The crooked gam es suppo­ sedly took p la c e iii V eg as motel rooms. 
Another charge comes from a South Texas ra n c h e r who says he was shaken down to the tune of well over SIUO.C'H), and subsequently threatened by the local s h a rp ie s if he didn t pay off in full. 
Still other c h a rg e s could result from the IHS going into the extent, if any, to which tin* alleged “ profits” were reported by off artists. This isn t Hie first tim e the sam e local highrolling business and professional m en have been c a n d id a te s for fe d e ra l indictment here. But som e­ how or other, the formal a c c u s a tio n s n e v e r c a m e through — and it’s possible all th e w eeks and m o n th s spent in current probe will draw a blank too.

Wallace defusing is motive 

WASHINGTON po st service 
WASHINGTON - Sen. 
Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., 
D-Tex., has decided to enter the Democratic presidential race. 
He is seeking a presidential primary in his home state as a test of s tr e n g th w ith 
A labam a. Gov. G eo rg e C. 
Wallace and other challengers. 
Washington sources close to the senator said Tuesday that 
Bentsen would announce his candidacy in six or eight weeks. 
M eanwhile, George C h ris­ tian, an Austin political a d ­ viser of Bentsen’s, said a bill to give Texas a presidential p rim a ry 
“ w ill p ro b a b ly emerge soon after the start of the legislative session” in mid-January. 
On tour 

Bentsen has been touring the country as an undeclared presidential hopeful for more than a y ea r, but T u e sd a y ’s d is c lo s u re w as th e f irs t definitive word th at he has decided to run. 
At the s a m e tim e it w as learned that representatives of Sen. H enry M. J a c k s o n , 
D-Wash., are negotiating for th e p u r c h a s e of n e tw o rk television time for a Jackson announcement the first week in February. 
Two c a n d id a te s — Rep. 
Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., and 
Gov. J im m y C a rte r, D, of 
Georgia — have announced, and ex-Sen. Fred R. H arris, 
D-Okla., is scheduled to an ­ nounce on Jan. ll. 
Defusing 

The Bentsen c a m p ’s deci­ sion to seek the f irs t p r e ­ sidential primary in Texas is the first step in the T exan’s strategy to defuse the c h a l­ lenge of Wallace. 
In 1972, when Texas chose its d e le g a te s by a caucus* convention system , W allace received 52 votes. Sen. George 
S. M cG overn, D -S.D ., 41; 
Jackson, 32, and m inor can ­ didates five. 
Wallace is expected to be strong again in Texas in 1976. and w h ile B e n tse n is not planning to run as a regional candidate, Ins m anagers con­ cede that he m ust establish his ability to beat Wallace in order to be taken as a serious contender. 
“ If he’s going to make a run for this thing, he’s got to show strength, and lie has strength to show here,” said Christian,

Higher oil price is eyed 

COMPOED TROM WIRE SERVICES 

WASHINGTON - 
President 
Ford reportedly is giving thought to raising the price of oil by $3 a. barrel to discourage fuel consumption. 
G o v e rn m e n t sources said 
Tuesday that the adm inistra­ tion is seriously considering r a is in g th e p ric e on both domestic and imported oil. 
By the common rule- of-thumb. a price increase of 
$3 per barrel on crude oil m ight lead to a price increase of about 7.5 cents per gallon at the pump. 
They also said there is re­ newed interest in gasoline ra ­ tioning, probably as a stand­ by program held in reserve to cope with unexpected short­ ages. 
Opposed 
But the sources said Presi­ dent Ford was still opposed to gasoline rationing a n d -to an increase in the gasoline tax as first-line energy-saving m eas­ u re s for his forthcoming policy proposals. 
Ford reviewed the energy’ options again at Vail, Colo., last weekend, and has been s e e k i n g to re a c h final d ec isio n s and propose a national energy policy in mid- 
J a n u a ry in his State of the 
U nion m essage and, per­ haps, a separate energy mes­ sage to Congress. 
While the options range far into the future with proposals for increasing U.S. energy p ro d u c tio n ,

WASHINGTON - 
The 
Watergate cover-up trial jury listened to tapes of presidential conver­ sations on two cri­ tical dates in the his­ tory of the scandal 
Tuesday, 

It then retired for the night without reaching and any verdicts. 
At the end of its second day deliberations the jury had spent 9^*j hours considering the evidence against the five defendants. 
The panel planned to return to the counthouse for a full day, of d e lib e r a t io n s oil* 
Wednesday, New Year’s Day. 
The jury notified 
U.S. 
District Judge John J. Sirica in midmorning Tuesday that it wanted to listen again to Hie tapes of presidential conversations on June 23,1973 and March 21,1973. 
I 
’O n l y defense and prosecution lawyers wen* allowed in the coml room after

Sirica ordered the tapes replayed in the afternoon. 
Awaiting a verdict in tilt trial which began Oct. I were former Atty. Gen. John N. 
Mitchell, former White House aides ll. R. Haldeman and 
John D. Ehrlichman, former 
Asst. Atty. Gen. Robert C. 
Mardian, and Kenneth W. 
Parkinson, one-time lawyer for 
Nixon’s reelection committee. 
The requests for tapes were delivered to the judge late 
Tuesday morning in notes signed by John A. Hoffar, the foreman* 
One note read: “Tape re­ quest: Haldeman-Nixon dis­ cussion about using the CIA to stop the FBI investigation.” 
The other read: “ Tape re­ quest: Dean's ‘there is a can­ cer on tho presidency’ to Nix­ on.” 
The CIA discussion took place during throe short conversations on June 23,1972, six days after tho Watergate break-in. Sirica ordered all three played for the jury. 
Between the second and third conversations that day 
Haldeman and Ehrlichman met with top CIA officials and 
Haldeman ordered them to 

 tell the, F B I that its investigation of money trac ed to a Mexican bank could uncover covert CIA activities in that country. 
After he made public the contents of the June 23 conversations, ''tost August, 
Nixon was forced to resign the presidency. 
Dean used the “ cancer on the presidency" analogy during a Match 21, 1973, conversation in which he told 
Nixon what he knew about the 
Watergate break-in and cover-up. 
Later in that discussion Nix­ on, 
Haldeman and Dean talked about demands for money and clemency from E. 
Howard Hunt, one of the break-in defendants. 
Among the charges against 
Haldeman is that helled to the 
Senate Watergate committee' when asked what was discussed during the March 21 conversation. 
All of the defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
All but 
Mardian are charged with obstruction of justice and 
Mitchell, 
Haldeman and 
Ehrlichm an also are charged with perjury. 
The maximum sentences 

 each would face if found guilty on all charges were Mitchell, 
25 years in prison and a $37,ooo fine; Haldeman, 25 years and 
$21,ooo; Ehrlichman, 2o years and $35,ooo; Mardian, five years and $1o,ooo; Parkinson, 
IO years and $15,ooo. the defendants and their families spent Tuesday in a series of small rooms on the second floor of the 
U.S. 
District Courthouse while the jury of nine women and three men was considering a verdict. 
A retired maid, a hotel door- m a n , m i d d l e - l e v e l government employes were among those on the jury that w'ould decide whether five men, including throe who once were among the most powerful in the world, were innocent or guilty of charges they conspired to obstruct the investigation of the Watergate break-in. 
S i n c e b e g i n n i n g deliberations on Monday, the jury has sent several other notes to Sirica. 
On Monday they asked for large chunks of trial testimony including that of 
Mitchell, Dean and Nixon campaign aides Jeb Stuart 
Magruder and FredC. LaRue.

Job aid measures signed 

ASSOCIATED FUESS 
VAIL, 
Colo. 
— 
President Ford signed bills Tuesday providing emergency unemployment benefits and more than 1oo,ooo public service jobs. 
The measures were designed to aid the growing ranks of the nation’s unemployed. 
He acted as the nation s 
11 unemployment rolls were 
‘reaching more than six million persons, 6.5 per cent of the American w?ork force. 
To finance the two measures, Ford said he will sign an urgent supplemental appropriation of $2.75 billion by Saturday. 
The Emergency Unemploy­ ment Compensation Act will provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits to persons who are n o w c o v e r e d by unemployment insurance, it thus will provide a full year’s benefits for persons who have lost their jobs. 
The companion Emergency 
Jobs and 
Unemployment 
A ssistance 
Act creates temporary unemployment insurance for employes not now covered by jobless benefits, including state and local government employ­ es, farm workers and domestic workers. It also provides up to 1oo,ooo new jobs in addition to 17o,ooo financed by funds under already existing law. 
Ford said the two bills, which he asked Congress to pass to fight inflation and u n e m p lo ym en t, were designed

So far, the administration was leaning toward the eco­ nomic approach, the sources said. 
T h e y s a i d t he administration was seriously- considering imposing a tariff of $3.oo per barrel on imported oil, raising its price from the present $11 or $12 to $14 or $15 per barrel. 
This might be matched by a 
4new tax on domestically- produced crude oil, possibly raising price-controlled “ old oil” from the present $5.25 to 
$8.25 per barrel and uncontrolled “ new oil” to the same price as imported oil, the sources said. 
These enormous tax and tariff revenues — some $18.6 billion a year — would somehow be pumped back to the public, maybe through income tax reductions, the sources added.

BENTSEN 

 who was press secretary to 
President Johnson and a strategist in Bentsen’s 197o senatorial campaign. 
“ It will be very difficult for him to have a locked-up delegation under any rules, but a primary is probably the best way for him to show his strength.” 

Briscoe 
Christian said the plan for a primary had been discussed with Texas Gov. Dolph Bris­ coe, who is supporting 
Bentsen. but added. “ I don't know if the governor will recommend it as part of Ins own program." 
Robert Hardesty, Briscoe’s press secretary, said “ the governor is not committed” to the idea “ but it could build up steam fast when the legislature comes back.” 
Christian said the “ odds are pretty good” a primary bill will be passed. 
The proposal under discus­ sion would place the primary on May I, 1976. the same day that Texas voters nominate candidates for Congress and for the one state office up in 
1976 — railroad commis­ sioner. 
That would mean Bentsen might be on the ballot twice that day - once as a candidate for renomination to the Sen­ 

 ate and again as a presiden­ tial contender. 
Tex as has never repealed the law' it passed in 196o to allow Lyndon Johnson to run for re-election to the Senate at the same time he was running for vice president. 
But it is not certain that 
Texas will have the type of presidential primary in which the candidates’ names are listed on the ballot. 
Bentsen’s advisers are divided on the desirability uf holding a direct "beauty con­ test" preference vote, and the likelihood is that such a vote would be advisory and non­ binding if it is included at all. 

Delegates 

The inclination, according to both Christian and Bentsen sources in Washington, is to set up a primary in which in­ dividual national convention delegates are elected directly by the voters, either from each of the 24 congressional districts or each of the 31 state senatorial districts. 
Recent surveys for Bentsen have indicated his delegates would be favored in "all but two or three of the districts,” according to one source. 
That type of primary is the one legal method under the national Democratic party’s new rules for avoiding a proportional representation of candidate preferences._______

Senate ratified the

Geneva Agreement that he said outlaws chemical warfare. 
The Pentagon, in response to queries, issued a written statement New Year’s Eve that disputed the facts as presented by Aspin, including his interpretations of the 
Geneva accord and the House action. 
“ In view of the reservations to the 1925Geneva Protocol in­ terposed by most parties, in­ cluding the United States, ratification will outlaw only the

 sistently stated that the 
United States will not employ chemical weapons in a first- use capacity. 
However, n a t i o n a l s e c u r i t y considerations require the 
United States to maintain a chemical weapons capability in order to provide an effective deterrent to the possible use of such weapons by a foreign power," the statement said. 
The Army’s continuous re­ search and* development and future planning, approved by 
Congress with appropriations. is fully in line with the proto­ col, it said. 
Aspin said that the Army’s 
Edgewood arsenal was starting on production when it asked companies whether they would convert their facilities to produce 
“ ton quantities” of two chemicals. 

The two chemicals together make up the lethal new gas when mixed on target in a spe­ cial projectile on which Aspin said the Army also was work­ ing. 
The 
Pentagon responded, 
“ The solicitation clearly stated ... that the government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited. The solicitation is a part of the n o r ma l process for determining whether in­ dustry might be interested in participating in defense pro­ grams."

Krishna school not for softies 

Deficiencies not known, says Coastal 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
D A L L A S 
— 
F o r one hundred children in East Dallas, life is so different from other Dallas children that their lifestyle is difficult for most people to comprehend. 

They are the children of H are K rish n a devotees who have been sent to Dallas by their parents to attend the Gurukula, a commune school for the children of Lord Krishna. 
Ranging in age from 3 to ll, the children arc indoctrinated with the teaching of the Bhag- vadgita, a Hindu spiritual text, in the m idst of a monkish existence of Eastern m ysticism cut off from the outside world. 
The school, located in an old church building in- Dallas, is funded by the Los Angeles-based 
International Society for Krishna Conscious­ n ess, founded in 1965 by a retired Indian b u sin e ssm a n , AXL B ak tiv ed an ta Sw am i 
Prabhupada. The movements m em ber have become a fam iliar sight in most large U.S. 

 cities, wearing saffron robes, their foreheads daubed with p aste, hopping up and down chanting “ Hare Ifrishna” . 
The boys’ heads are shaven, except for a top knot, so Krishna can yank them into heaven at the proper tim e. The boys w ear dhotis, the orange wrap-around. 
The single goal of the Gurukula is to make priests of the boys. At age IO, m ost of them go to a farm in West Virginia. 
G irls in the school are encouraged to be submissive. They wear ankle length saris and keep their heads covered to discourage men. 
Many of the girls wear rings in their noses-thc holes made with sewing needles-as a m ark of chastity. 
The children’s day begins at 4 a.m . and ends at 7 p.m. when, segregated by sex and age, they go to sleep on m ats in a damp church basement. 
The typical day in (he school includes two or three show ers du rin g the d ay, num erous religious services and six daily- offerings of food to Krishna. 

Coastal States Gas Corp. officials denied Tuesday they knew in 1962 that Alamo Gas Corp. lacked gas reserves when they purchased the company that year. 

The denial came in light of m emos that showed up during a recent Bexar County Grand 
Jury investigation that repor­ tedly in d icated they knew 
Alamo did not ha\e enough natural gas to supply San An­ tonio. 
“ All m em os cover deficien­ cies in contracts. The prob­ lem ’s with contracts and not g a s re se rv e s.” said Robert 
Wells, a 
Coastal vice president. 
Memo 
Wells said former legal ad­ v iso r N orm an D avis sent 
Alamo President Glen Martin a memo on Jan . ‘24. 1962 say­ ing . that United G as Corp. wanted to break its contract with Alamo before C oastal's takeover on April I. 1962. 
“ The m em o state d that 
Davis .w anted M art'n to sup­ ply Coastal w ith all copies of th eir c o n trac ts so C o a stal could check the legal aspects of the contracts.” Wells said. 
Wells explained several in­ house m em os were sent that talked about the deficiency that existed in one contract or another. 
“ C oastal discovered they had contract problem s with g a s producers covering 195 billion cubic feet of gas. We are still checking our files, but so fa r w e've found we covered 141 billion cubic feet. 
“ I am sure that by April I. 
1962,all the p rob lem s had been cured or w ere in the process of being cured," said 
Wells. 
Substituted 

W ells sa id in one case a producer did not m eet the re q ire m e n ts, and C o astal su b stitu ted re se rv e s of its own to meet the City Public 
Service contract. 
The issu e of the m em o arose when the Securities and 
E xch an ge 
C om m issio n reopened its investigation in­ to Coastal two months ago. 

Lila’s leave new signal? 

Mayor Pro Tem Lila Cockrell announced 
Tuesday she is taking a four-month leave of absence from her regular job, but she still won’t say if she is running for mayor. 

Mrs. Cockrell said she is taking the leave from Jan . I to 
May I “ because I do anticipate the work load (for City 
Council) will be increasingly heavy and because I have a grow ing number of speaking engagements. . 
“ I don't want to m ake any comment about my plans at this time.” she said when asked if she planned to run for mayor. 
She said she expected to be involved in the upcoming city elections but would not say she meant as a candidate. 
Election date is April I. 
Mrs. Cockrell is director of community relations for the 
Ecum enical Center for Religion and H ealth, which is located in the South T exas Medical Center complex. 
Farm prices have decline 

 one-half of I per cent from 
Nov. 15 and averaged 16 per cent above Dec. 15, 1973. 
Although erratic, farm com­ modity prices frequently are reflected in wholesale prices later on. The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics will report on those for Decem ber in about two weeks. 
The farm price index had previously declined two per cent in the month ended Sept. 
15. It then rose 4 per cent in 
October and 1.5 per cent in No­ vem ber. 
Department experts have predicted retail food prices will continue up in 1975 at about their 1974 pace at least through mid-year. 
In 1974, officials have said, rising costs of transportation, labor, processing, and other middlemen expenses have ac­ counted for at least 8o per cent of the retail grocery price in­ crease.________________

WASHINGTON - The prices farmers received for raw a g r ic u lt u r a l products fell 3 per cent from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, the first decline in three months, the Agriculture 
Department said T u e s ­ day. 
The Crop Reporting Board said lower prices for upland cotton, wheat, cattle, lettuce and soy beans contributed most to the decline. 
Higher prices were reported for hogs and eggs during the month, officials said. 
As of Dec. 15, the report said, the average of all farm prices was 4 per cent lower than a year earlier. Prices f a r m e r s pay to m eet expenses, meanwhile, rose

IRA accept ^ ule truce extension 

 w a s h i n g t o n p o s t sr rvic e 
LONDON - The British government Tuesday offered the Irish Republican Army 
URA) a package of modest 
Concessions, including beedom for 2o suspected terrorists, to prolong the, 
Christmas truce. 
* The gesture appeared to be getting a warm response from 

 may 

 the 
IRA's militant 
Provisional wing, raising hopes that the peace would 

 l a s t at least through January.; 
If this timetable is met, it would mean Lister and 
England will have been spared IRA bombs and bullets for 4o days. That would be the longest episode without violence since t I* 

 ster's 
Protestants and 
Catholics renewed their an­ cient war six years ago. 
A five-week truce, moreover, could inspire fresh concessions from London that] might extend the peace1 indefinitely. 
An IRA spokesman, Walter 
I ynch, said in Dublin that he was mcouraged by the new 

 package. From Belfast, the 
Rev. William J. Arlow, a protestant minister and in­ termediary between the IRA and London, said in a telephone interview that the new moves "will meet the requirements’’ of the terrorists for a truce to Jan. 
31. 
The Provisionals, their 

 ranks depleted by army raids and losing support in Catholic ghettoes, began their cease­ fire on Dec. 22. With British soldiers deliberately reducing their patrols, the truee has been scrupulously observed in Ulster. 

But it was due to run out at midnight on Thursday, and 

 the new concessions wert carefully drawn to preserve it. 
As far as is known, there has been no direct contact between the British govern­ ment and the outlawed guerrillas. Instead, Rev. 
Arlow and seven other 
Protestant churchmen have been serving as go-betweens, 

 meeting first one side aud then the other. 
The most concrete gesture from London Tuesday was the release from detention of 2o alleged terrorists. They were among 553 men and women I 
Catholic and Protestant, who had been imprisoned without any charge of trial. 
The number freed was well 

 below the figure that the IRA has been publicly demanding, hut it embraced several per­ sons whose detention had aroused angry Catholic emo­ tions. Among them were John 
Joe 
McGirl, 
54, of 
Ballinamore in the Irish 
Republic, a veteran IRA member, and Mrs. Evelyn 
Gilroy, 22, of Belfast, the only mother who had been held uncharged and untried. 

Suspects 

Of the 2o, 17 are suspected 
IRA members and 3 allegedly come from 
Protestant terrorists bands. The IRA, it is understood, has stressed that the first freed detainees should include members of both sects. 
In addition, three-day paroles starting Tuesday night will be given another 5o detainees. 
Finally, the government here said it would free in the next few days nearly all convicted terrorists whose sentences run out by March 31. 
Authorities estimate that about 125 persons will enjoy this early release, divided al­ most evenly between Protes­ tants and Catholics. Ulster jails now hold 1,291 men and women who have been con­ victed.of terrorists offenses ranging from illegal posses­ sion of weapons to murder. 
Merlyn Rees, Britain’s minister for Ulster, also voiced Tuesday some vague but crucial expressions to strengthen the truce. 
In January, he pledged, he would explain publicly how a lasting end to violence “ w ould enable the army to make a planned, orderly and progressive reduction in its present commitment.’’ 
This is something less than the IR A ’s demand for a. 
"planned, orderly and progressive withdrawal** of the 14,ooo British troops from 
Ulster. But it contained enough of the flavor to be seized on by Lynch, the IRA spokesman. 

Lynch says 

Lynch, secretary of the 
Provisional Sinn Feim or legal political arm of the IRA, said; 
“ If the British government is sincere about the planned * withdrawal, this is one of’the things the (IRA) movement has been seeking. On the face of it, it seems that the British may be accepting that (Ul­ ster) is part of a united 
Ireland.” 
In fact, Rees and the British government accept no such thing and insist that Ulster, with its two-to-one Protestant majority, cannot be forced into a union with the 
Catholic-Dominated republic in the South. 
Instead, what was going on was a delicate game of ges­ ture and response that could be widened and broadened the longer the peace lasts. The 
British government has repeatedly promised that it would end its hated system of detention without trial if the violence stopped, and the 
Rees renewed that pledge again Tuesday. 
The IRA’s so-called army council, it was learned, met on Monday and again Tues­ day at a secret place in the 
Republic. If the cease-fire is to continue through January, it is the body that will give the order. 
Hard-line Protestant poli­ ticians, led by the Rev. Ian 
Paisley, promptly condemned the 
Rues package as 
"compromise with evil.’’ 
This was to be expected. 
Their strength diminishes with the IRA puts down its guns and bombs. 
In Ulster’s politics militant 
Protestants are the third leg of an unstable triangle. Their paramilitary forces could still unleash their own wave of killings to upset any truce between Britain and the IRA.

MIAMI. Fla. (AP) - The leader of a Nicaraguan guer­ rilla group which flew to Cuba after pulling off a successful mass political kidnaping in 
Nicaragua says the plot was planned for 2o days. Havana radio reported Tuesday.

M arcos said the kidnaping of a dozen prom inent governm ent officials and others was "a political action o f p r o f o u n d s o c i a l repercussion" in Nicaragua, according to the

HINCE MO 

N t w r o m T iM is s o v i e t 
TOKYO — P re m ie r 
Takeo Miki in his new year message told the 
Japanese people T ues­ day that the troubled si­ tuation in the Middle 
East and inflation were the greatest issues fac­ ing Japan and the world in 1975. 
“The international political situation is undergoing a great change,” the premier said. ‘ ‘There has been a growing tendency toward fer­ mentation of friction between resource-producing countries and consuming nations over the question of petroleum.” 
He said that the Japanese government would welcome a m eeting between oil producers and consum ers because it believed that solu­ tions to problems relating to petroleum could be attained only through cooperation among them. Harmony in this matter is of prime concern to 
Ja p a n , which ranks third among the world’s industrial nations, because she is wholly reliant on imported oil. 
‘‘In the interest of world peace and prosperity, Japan is ready to play a responsible role worthy of her national strength in the current inter­ national endeavor to settle the oil issue amicably,” Miki told the nation. 
M iki, who assum ed the p rem iersh ip early in 
D ecem ber also said th at 
Ja p a n would renew her e f­ forts to assist middle eastern oil-producing cou n tries in their efforts to industrialize. 
He said he could fully under­ stand the view of the leaders of such nations ‘‘that while their natural resources are abundant, they must achieve in d u s tria liz a tio n of th e ir countries so that their des­ cendants might not wander about the deserts aimlessly.” 
Discussing domestic prob­ lem s, the premier said that the governm ent would en ­ deavor to brin g in flation under control and “ to get rid of the current recession.” 
“ Japan has felt the effects of inflation more keenly than other countries because she has to rely heavily upon im ­ ports of petroleum, foodstuffs and other raw' materials,” he declared. 
The government will do its utmost to reduce the annual increase in consumer prices to less than IO per cent, Miki said. He expressed hope that this could be attained by 
March. The rate recently was close to 25 per cent, but there have been signs recently that the inflation was slowing. 
Miki said the government would not relax its policy of cu rbin g dom estic dem and and would continue the cur­ rent cred it squeeze until prices stabilized. He urged labor unions to hold th e ir demands for wage increases to a “ reJfconable level” in the annual spring “ labor offen­ siv e /’

ST. PAUL, Minn. - 
“ Hey, pinhead, get the babvlifter and snake and ask the rawhider to rab­ bit the kettle.” 
T h a t ’ s p r o b a b l y gotbledegook to you. And it's gobbledegook to any railroad newcomer who steps into the yard w ithout doing homework on the lingo veterans use. 
Some might take it more personally than others, since women have been joining the ranks of what once w tis an all­ male calling. 
For instance, a woman aspiring to be a locomotive engineer had better get used to being called “hog head,” a spokesm an for 
Burlington 
Northern, Inc., says. 
Earthy business 

T h e e a r t h y ra ilro a d business that grew up with the cou ntry also acquired a language of its own. 
And o l d t i m e r s could ch a n t hundreds of word-symbols in railroad jargon. 
Some of them have passed from the scene with the evolu­ tion of the “ Iron Horse” — a term , incidentally, that the railroad men leave to the rom anticists when talking about locomotives. 
Here’s a sample of what the yardmen might spout: 
Air Monkey: air brake re­ pairperson. 
Battleship: locomotive, par­ ticularly a large one. 
Cornfield meet: headon 
• crash of two trains on the main track. 
D o g c a t c h e r s : crew relieving another under the 
16-hour law. 
Deadhead 

Deadhead: employe riding on company pass on company business. 
G a n d y d a n c e r : track laborer. 
Goat: yard engine. 
Highball artist: engineer noted for the fast runs. 
Lightning slinger: telegraph operator. 
Lizard scorcher: cook. 
Master maniac: master me­ chanic. 
Seash ore:sand. 
Sm art alec or swell head: conductor. 
The caboose is kicked around more often than any other type of equipment when railroad men talk their own language. 
It’s variously referred to as: bouncer, bed house, chariot, clown wagon, crib, crummy, hack, hay wagon, hearse, pal­ ace, parlor, saloon, shanty. 
Oh, yes, you’re still waiting for a translation of the jargon in the first paragraph. Well, it means: “ Hey, new brakeman, get the passenger brakeman and switchman and ask the conductor to derail the locomotive.”

N E W VO U K t i m e s SERVICE 

NEW DELHI - India and 
Portugal Tuesday re-esta b ­ lished diplomatic relations after a break of nearly 2o years. 
The foreign ministers of the two countries. V B. Chavan of 
India and Mario Soares of 
Portugal, signed a friendship treaty at the end of a five-day visit by the Portuguese min­ isters. Soares is the first Por­ tuguese official to v isit India since the coup in Lisbon last 
April. 
He was received warmly in 
New Delhi and was accorded an enthusiastic welcome in the former Portuguese en ­ clave of Goa. which he visited over the weekend. 
India seized Goa and other P o r­ tuguese territories in 1961, six years after India and Pakis­ tan broke off diplomatic relations. 

Under the treaty, Portugal renounced her claims to her former Indian territories and acknowledged India’s suzer­ ainty over Goa and the en­ claves of Dadra and Nagar 
Haveli, all in western India. 
After signing the treaty, 
Soares told newsmen that the conflict between India and 
Portugal was not between the peoples of the two countries but between India and the former “ Facist regim e” in 
Lisbon, lie said the treaty marked the beginning of a new era of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. A Portuguese trade mission is due here shortly to negotiate a trade agreement, he said. 

Chavan said the treaty bur­ ied all p ast conflicts and opened up p rosp ects for friendly relations.

The old frontal system at midday was stretched along a line from Longview in East 
Texas to McAllen in the Rio 
Grande Valley. Dalhart had 25 degrees and clear skies while 
Brownsville recorded 75 de­ grees under cloudy skies. It was cloudy in all sections ex­ cept in the Amarillo area. Ty­ ler had fog. 
Weathermen said the new cold front will encompass the whole state Wednesday with mostly cloudy skies and light rain everywhere except far

Quake toll in Pakistan now 5,2oo 

ASSOCUTfO M IS S 
. PATTAN, Pakistan — The death toll in northern Pakistan’s earthquake four days ago rose to an estimated 5,2oo Tuesday, up 
5oo with the discovery of two more mountain villages prac­ tically destroyed in the weekend disaster. 
Prim e Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appealed for international aid. 
Among the country’s needs, said Brig. Aftab 

Ahmad Khan, who supervises rescue oper­ ations, are “ literally tons of plaster of Paris” to set thousands of broken limbs. 
He also asked for 2,ooo to 3,ooo tents, medicines, blankets and rations. 
Thousands of the injured, made homeless by the auake, are still living in the open beyond the reach of medical care. 
Bhutto flew by helicopter into this village which is the center for relief operations and ap­ pealed to the international community to respond to Pakistan’s plight. 
While touring the village and inspecting the dam age he told correspondents: “All we can do is draw the world’s attention to what has happened in the hope of a real and positive 

 response to the very real and substantial dam age." 
The m ajor problem still facing rescue workers is the remoteness and inaccessibility of most of the earthquake region 2oo miles north of the capital of Islamabad among the snow capped peaks of the 
Karakoram 
Mountains. 
The Karakoram highway, the region’s main artery, has been severed along a 7o-mile stretch by the earthquake. 
Nearly all rescue work is being done by arm y h e lic o p te rs. 
So far they have been concentrating on supplying the two existing relief centers, here and at Bisham, 19 miles to the south. 
Vietnam 
'74 eve fighting fierce 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAIGON 
— 
South 
Vietnamese troops were reported locked in heavy fighting with Com m un­ ist-led forces 75 miles north of Saigon on New 
Year’s Eve. 
M ilitary analysts saw the battle as a foretaste of even fiercer fighting predicted for the first six months of 1975. 
The North Vietnamese and 
Viet Cong already control much of the northern sectors of the provinces bordering 
Cambodia, which shortens supply lines of the Communist side. 
As 1974 drew to a close the 
Saigon command reported it had suffered 27,355 men killed, 
11o,777 wounded and 15,o84 missing in the nearly two years since the cease-fire agreem ent was signed in 
J a n u a ry 
1973, and was supposed to end the bloodshed. 
Claim 
During the same period, the* com m and claim ed, 
South 
Vietnamese forces have killed 
1o4,67o North Vietnamese and 
Viet 
Cong troops. 
But m ilitary analysts say this is only an estim ate and likely an inflated one. The Communist side has declined to disclose its losses. 
In the current fighting, the 
S outh 
V ietnam ese were b a t t l i n g to hold the governm ent’s only remaining district town in isolated Phuoc 
Long province bordering 
C am bodia. 
Three of the province’s four district towns have been overrun since Dec. 
6. 
The province is cut off by road, and two big cargo planes trying to airlift supplies to the estim ated 
5o,ooo civilians, about half of them refugees, have been shot down. 
Helicopters were reported ferrying in small quantities of supplies and occasional rein­ forcements to the provincial capital of Phuoc Binh. 
The Saigon command said the last district town, also called Phuoc Binh but 2V£ m i l e s southw est of the provincial capital by the same nam e, is in danger ot falling after being pounded by 5oo artillery shells and a series of infantry assaults. 
Tanks reported 
N orth 
Vietnamese tanks also were reported just to the w est of the town, the command said. 
Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, chief spoilsm an for the Saigon command, said the fall of the district town would seriously e n d a n g e r the provincial capital, where most of the refugees have fled. 
The North Vietnamese and 
Viet Cong have not captured a provincial capital in South 
Vietnam since the 1972 Easter offensive when they seized 
Quang Tri in the northern quarter of the country. 
Some m ilitary observers said the North Vietnamese could capture Phuoc Binh any t i m e t he y wanted but apparently are holding off in efforts to minimize their own losses. 
Hien said the Communist o b j e c t i v e is to expand territorial control in three p r o v i n c e s b o r d e r i n g 
Cambodia north of Saigon. 
- These are from Tay Ninh, 
Binh Long and Phuoc Long.

ASSOCIATED RIESS 

Rain, snow and drizzle spread through the interior of the nation Tuesday as Ameri­ cans prepared to ring in the 
New Year. 
As the holiday traffic fatality count began, the 
N a t i o n a l 
Safety 
Council projected that between 17o and 23o persons may be killed on the nation’s roads and highways during the one- day celebration. 
The traffic count began at 6 p.m. local time Tuesday and will end at midnight Wednes­ day.

The supply operation has left little time for complete aerial .surveys of the hundreds of sm all villages and hamlets, many of them tucked away in remote valleys and literally on the lower mountain tops amid peaks rising as high as 15,ooo feet. 
Reports from the growing numbers of injured flocking here for medical treatment and food indicate that thousands are still in the mountains urgently requiring assistance. 
The total number of injured is now estimated at 
16,ooo. About 1,ooo have been treated at two hospitals set up here. 
In Washington, the State Department said 
U.S. Ambassador Henry A. Byroade had made a U.S. contribution of $25,ooo for relief.

Bombs won” t budge 
Rocky 

ASSO CIATED m ss 
SAN JUAN, IVR. - Ter­ rorists launc hed a wave of bombings across 
Puerto Rico on Tuesday 
Vice President Nelson A. 
Rockefeller said the blasts would not force him to end his vacation. 
“ The same thing has hap­ pened in New York,” he told newsmen at a hotel outside 
San Juan. Pressed for further com m ent, 
Rockefeller answered sharply, “ What do you want me to do? Go down there and help clean things up?” 
The bombs went off at two branches of the 
Chase 
Manhattan Bank, a power plant and a gas pipeline, causing damage but no injuries. 
The power plant bombing blacked out an area of 36,ooo residents and caused 
$1oo,ooo in damage, police said. Unexploded bonita also were found at two other Chase branches, two other pow­ er plants and a supermarket. 
Rockefeller’s brother, David, is chairman of Chase. 

Independence 

No group claimed responsi­ bility for the blasts, but specu­ lation fell on groups seeking 
Puerto Rican independence from the United States. On 
Sunday, pro i tide pend e nee groups picketed the hotel where 
R o ck e fe lle r is vacationing with his wife, 
Happy, and Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger and his wife, Nancy. 
Rockefeller, who arrived last Thursday, looked tan and relaxed after five days in the sun. He wore a bright yellow sport shirt and blue golf pants, and met with reporters and photographers near the pm shop on the golf course at the hotel. 
He lat'er played a round of golf with Puerto Rican pro 
Juan “ Chichi” Rodriguez. It was the first time Rockefeller had come out of the seclusion of his private Caribbean holi- dav to meet with the newsmen. 
In the brief encounter, 
Rockefeller also said he favored closer cooperation between Latin America and the United States. He said better ties should come in the areas of economil's, culture and politics, but lie declined to be more specific.

“ There are no speedy solu­ tions," he said. “ I think the 
United States is now ready to listen and not attempt to dic­ tate policy.” 
He said he wrote a long re­ port for then-President 
Richard M. Nixon following his widely heralded trip to 
Latin America in 1969. but he admitted that few of tin1 recommendations had been implemented. 
“ The United States has been preoccupied with the Middle 
East, Vietnam and the energy crisis, and as a result has not put priority on its relations with Latin America,” he said. 

Trial date set for ex-senator 

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Afed- eral judge refused Tuesday to dismiss housing fraud con­ spiracy charges against former Sen. Edward Gurney and set trial for him and six co defendants for Jan. 2o in 
Tampa. 
U.S. 
District Judge 
Ben 
Krentzman said there was no basis for dismissal of charges alleging a scheme to collect kickbacks from contractors seeking Gurney’s influence with the 
Federal Housing 
Authority. 
Gurney’s lawyers claimed irregularities and improper ju ry selection in the p r o c e e d in g s of the 
Jacksonville grand jury which indicted Gurney and the other six defendants. 
But Krentzman ruled that’ the federal court derk had made a conscientious efiort to1 find qualified jurors.

WASHINGTON post SMvtCE 
WASHINGTON - Some 
1975 predictions for the bureaucratic beat: 
Horror stories of the 1969-73 political incursions into the merit system will dominate the federal scene for the first few months. sharing the de­ pressing limelight along with selective hiring and promo­ tion freezes. 
The House Post Office-Civil 
Service Committee will hold early, maybe lengthy, hear-i 

 mgs spotlighting illegal or improper political actions of the last five years. 
Committee investigators have been digesting Civil 
Service Commission secret reports of politically inspired wrongdoing at the Justice 
Department. Small Business 
Administration and Health, 
Education and 
Welfare 
Department. 
When the hearings, under new chairman David Hender­ son, D-N.C., kick off they will also bring up new material on already publicized political patronage rings at General 

Federal 
Diary 

Services Administration and the Housing and 
Urban 
Development Department, and improper use of workers and consultants at the Office of Economic Opportunity. 
If - and only if - President 
Ford gives a public signal, 
Congress will make another stab at raising salaries of 

 political and appointed of­ ficials (and judges) who have not had-a pay raise since 1969. 
The pay attempt will be a half-measure, and not the 12.5 per cent raise the lame-duck 
1974 Congress planned to push through hut scrubbed because of the economic situation and chill winds from the White 
House. 

Most likely the legislation will ask a I to 6 per cent raise for the executives now lodged between $6o,ooo and $36,ooo, and a change in the law’ which icalls for quadrennial pay ad­ 

 justments for top government brass. 
Blue collar federal workers will continue to get larger percentage pay raises than their white-collar colleagues. 
The wage board workers are tied to prevailing local industry rates. White collar 
(classified) civil servants get adjustments each October, based on government reviews of national wages paid in industry. 
There will be a serious at­ tempt in Congress to increase the taxpayer subsidy to the 
U.S. Postal Service to head off 

 a 2 or 3 cent hike in stamp prices. Postal Employe Union demands this year would force higher stamp fees, un­ less Congress gives the Postal 
Service more money to make up the gap between income and its multi-billion dollar outgo. 
The American Federation of Government Employes w ill push for merger or al least agreement to merge by 1976 with two smaller unions representing specialized groups of federal workers. 
There will be selective hir­ ing and promotion freezes in 

 several federal agencies. 
Despite cutbacks, the 
Defense Department will not ask for nationwide authority to grant early retirement to its workers. If reductions-in- force hit some installations especially hard, Defense will ask for and be given early-out retirement authority for selected geographic regions. 
More Federal agencies 
(Social Security and Navy are already doing it) will exper­ iment with the flexi-time concept, which permits workers to set their own hours.

Kilauea volcano sends molten lava 3oo feet in air 

LAVA GUSHES FROM KILAUEA VOLCANO 
. . . dazzling fireworks lasted several hours 

VOLCANO. Hawaii (AP) - 
Kilauea volcano on the island of Hawaii erupted early today, sending a shower of molten lava 3oo feet into the nighttime sky. 
The outbreak began at 2:55 a.m. Hawaii time (8:55 a.m. 
EST), about V/2 miles south of 
Halemaumau Crater along the o u ter 
C a ld e r a fracture, according to a spokesman at the United States Geological 
Survey Observatory in Hawaii 
Volcanoes National Park. 

T h e s p e c t a c u la r lava shower lit up the sky along a threemile line of fissures — or fountains. They form a partial ring around the southern end of the crater of the volcano, at an elevation of about 3,5oo feet. 
The average fountain w as 
IOO feet high, the spokesman said. 

The activity had subsided considerably by 8 a.m. and very little fountaining re­ mained. he said. Visibility was 

 reported to be poor due to fumes and rain. 
Kilauea last erupted Sept. 
IO. 
Donald Peterson, scientist in charge of the volcano observatory, telephoned the s u r v e y ’s headquarters in 
Washington with the initial report. 
Peterson said he and his col­ leagues were awakened by a seismic alarm that was trig­ gered by a rash of small earthquake tremors beginning 

 at 12:2o a.m.. about 2V2 hours before the eruption. 
- 

A short time later, he saicfc the volcano, which had been sw elling and inflating uj re c e n t w eeks, deflated sharply and suddenly — a sigil that lava was about to erupt* 

Scientists had been keeping close watch on the volcano for several weeks because of a series of earthquakes and in­ flation in the Kilauea summit. 

There is no immediate dan­ ger to any people or cultivated land, the survey reported. 
Peterson said the lava is moving southward into an uninhabited desert area on the south flank of Kilauea. The area is the Kau Desert of 
Hawaii National Park. 
The eruption is located about 3o miles southwest of 
Hilo, the main city on the island. 
Peterson said it is difficult to predict how long the eruption will last. 
Such activity may come on strong for some period of time — perhaps for several days or weeks — and then gradually t a p e r off, the su rv ey explained. 

From the sharp deflation of the volcano just before the eruption, Peterson said, "we do not see an immediate and sudden end of the eruption." 

He said that since May of 
1969, Kilauea has been active about 9o per cent of the time. 
The present burst of activity,' however, he said. is coming' from an entirely new area — one from which eruptions have not occurred in historic times. 

Peterson emphasized that the eruption was from Kilauea and not from Mauna Loa. the giant neighbor volcano, which also has shown signs of restlessness in recent weeks. 

Majestic 
Theater closes doors 

The Majestic Theater, beset by fin an cial troub les and sm all audiences, closed its doors Tuesday night after 45 years of operation in down-* town San Antonio.

Pow ers said the theater switched to Spanish film s recently in a bid to stay alive but that move failed "mainly b e c au se 
. of the c ity ’ s prolonged bus strike.’’ 
The Dallas-based Theater

Corp. 
"W e put th ou san d s of dollars into renovations and people just weren’t coming to see the films — no matter what they w e re ," Pow ers noted.

Strong sense of purpose needed for the new year 

A realistic stance for Americans in the New Y ear is to a s s u m e that 
Chicken Little is right. 
Hut instead of running for dear life, let's get props in place to keep the sky from falling. 
U n c e r ta in ty is the m o s t- c e r ta in facto r b o th e r in g us and ec o n o m ic health d e m a n d s a credible sense of purpose and direction. Because we are a c u te ly s e n sitiv e to the role of g o v e rn m e n t—and b e cau se we have built government into so many basic enterprises of the country—it becomes government’s obligation to set out on a c re d ib le p r o g r a m to cope with the dilemma of “ stagflation.” 
That process will begin with the 
P r e s id e n t’s State of the Union m e s ­ sage in about two weeks. 
The process will be developed as the Congress is willing and able to discharge its obligation to enact legis­ lation that will let the economy adjust to its worldwide strains. 
President Ford has abandoned his plea for a surtax on middle and upper income taxpayers and is considering a request for tax cuts and allowances as a stimulant. Since inflation pumps in more income and also raises costs, tax policy has to estimate when to tax and when to spend in trying to m an ag e recession and inflation. 
A staff study bv tin' Congressional 
Joint Economic Committee found tin' g o v e rn m e n t is now losing m o re to recession than it is gaining from in­ flation. Hence, the change to tax cut 

 rather than to an increase. 
Congress has the clear duty to a n ­ alyze its spending. We don't expect it to do so but the duty remains just as clear. The com m ittee staff a ssu m es 
Congress will refuse to make the cuts 
Mr. Ford proposed several weeks ago of around $4.H billion and will help, instead, to build a deficit of up to $22.8 billion for the c u r r e n t fiscal y e a r 
(en d in g J u n e 3o) and a following deficit of $3o.4 billion the next fiscal year. 
This kind of fo re c a st a s s u m e s threat of recession is worse than inflation. 
C o n g ress b e a r s h e a v ie r r e s p o n ­ sibility in the new session because of its o v e rw h e lm in g m a j o r it y of 
Democrats. The Dem ocratic le a d e r­ ship has to be accountable for a wor­ k a b le p r o g ra m b e c a u s e it has the decisive power to shape the program. 
Politically am b itio u s D e m o c ra ts in 
Congress will have to run on the record their colleagues make this year. 
Congress h a s written into law a scandalous series of su b sid ies that gnaw at the foundations of sound bud­ geting and there is no effective reas­ sessment of those subsidies in being. 
Our country also shares tht‘ burden of blunting worldwide recession at the end of the current binge of inflation. 
It will take time to adjust to econ­ omic zig-zags of the past year but we have time if we have strong sense of purpose. 
Happy Now Year anyway. 
Sen. Ervin earns niche in history with strong defense of America 

This country won’t see the likes of 
Sam J. Ervin Jr. on Capitol Hill soon. 
Senator Frvin is a Conservative. He is a Southerner. He is a scrapper. And he was in the right place at the right time. 
As chairm an of the Senate W a te r­ g a te C o m m i t t e e , he so lid ifie d his claim to a place in American history. 
Ile had just directed a long investiga­ tion of g o v e r n m e n t i n f r i n g e m e n t s upon the liberties and rights of A m e r­ icans under the Constitution when the' crim in al series known as W atergate b ro k e like a t h u n d e r b o lt o v e r the country. Scope of those misdeeds was slow to sink into m a n y A m e r i c a n minds and anyone with lesser Conser­ vative credentials than E rvin’s would have had tough going as chairman of that Watergate committee. 
One could sense righteous indigna­ tion welling up in this big man as wit­ nesses parades before the committee. 

Top men in government had subverted constitutional law and Ervin’s sense of o u tra g e g r e w m o re in te n s e as th e h e a rin g s p ro c e e d e d . He w o n d e r e d aloud more than once why none of the people trained in law failed to stop the subversion. 
Ervin is no saint; he’s just ‘‘an oP country law yer” who'w as g rad u ated from Harvard Law School and had a high regard for the Constitution and the country. He is *aot above a bit of ham-acting, with his Bible quotations and wit. But he brooked no nonsense in p ressin g the h e a r i n g s to a conclusion—aided by nearly all the other members. 
So he leaves the Senate. And the 
Senate will proceed without him, but he became a very valuable m e m b e r while he was there as guardian of the rights and privileges of A m ericans. 
The job needed to be done and he did it well. 
Continuous construction in progress 

The County Courthouse is the com ­ m unity’s largest permanent construc­ tion project. 
It has had three permanent changes and unnumbered temporary ones, in­ side and out. Its ancient north, east and south facades are startled by its modern west facade. Its once-spacious insides have been filled in with cubi­ cles for new offices and courts. 
Now p la n n e r s discuss a ir s p a c e above Main Ave. to the west for hous­ ing new c o u rts. The old p lac e is beginning to be the parallel to that tired old one-liner: “ A camel is a horse

Break-ins of CIA just for practice 

 built by a com m ittee.” 
There is support for having “ ever­ ything under one roof.” Advocates of such arrangem ents haven’t said why. 
Fifteen y e a rs ago there w ere a p ­ peals for a co u rts building, a civic c en ter for public bu ild in g s, even a building in the c o u rth o u s e a r e a to house a u x iliary functions of county go v ern m en t, like the county a g e n t, school superintendent, even the s h e r ­ iff’s department. 
County planning is weak, we know, but Tinker-Toy architecture ought to' lie avoided. 

WASHINGTON - 
For some years now 
W ashington, 
D.C., has had one of the highest robbery rates of any city in the country.

So you can im a g in e our surprise when all of us picked up the New York T im es the other day and read that there was som e evidence the CIA had been involved in breaking and e n te r in g and oth er second-story jobs in the capital. 
No one know s how m a n y break-ins the CIA w as invol­ ved in. but it certainly does pose a problem as far as our crim e rate is concerned. 
My frien d , G e o r g e W a ­ shington Custer, called me as soon as he read th e sto ry. 
“ H ey, m a n ,’’ he said ch or­ tling. “ You read w here the 
CIA’s been committing all the break-ins in our fair city?” . 
“ The story didn’t say that,” 
I warned Custer. “ It indicated that there was a possibility that the CIA may have been involved in some break-ins in the name of national security.” 

“ W hat are they breaking into h o m e s in W a sh in g to n for? I thought they were sup­ p osed to spy on all th ose 
Communists in Russia.” 

Friends 

“ T h a t’s the point, Custer. 
In order to spy on Commun­ ists in the Soviet Union, it is s o m e t im e s n e c e s s a r y to break into people's homes iii the U nited S tates. But I’m cer ta in the CIA w ou ld not sneak into anybody's house unless they were certain they were friends of our enemies abroad " 

“ How would th e y know that?” Custer demanded. 

“ B ecau se ap p aren tly the 
CIA kept a list of Americans that w ere s u s p e c t. 
T hey probably weren’t permitted to rob your house u n le s s you were on the list."

Texans drive a lot 

EXPRESS W ASHING TO N BUREAU 

WASHINGTON - The 
F e d e r a l H ighw ay A d ­ m in is tr a tio n r e p o r te d 
Monday what Texans al­ ready knew — residents of the Lone S ta r State drive a lot. 
Texas was second in annual vehicle miles with 8o.6 billion for 1973, the latest year for which full statistics are available. 
C aliforn ia fin ish e d first with 129.8 billion, New York was third with 67.6 billion. 
Preliminary nationwide e s­ tim a te s for 1974 in d ic a te vehicle-miles will decrease by 
3 per cent from the 1973 figure of 1,3o9 billion. 
The drop indicates “ lasting changes may have occurred in the travel h a b its of th e 
A m er ica n p u b li c ,” the agency said. 
Urban streets accounted for 
54.1 per cent of all veh icle travel although they re p r e ­ sent just 16 per cent of the total road m i le a g e in th e country. The Interstate S y s­ tem. about one per cent of to­ tal road m ileage, handled 19 per cent of the traffic. 
Annual rn iles-p er-veh icle fell from 1o,37o in 1972 to 
1o,o81 in 1973 after sev era l years of increases. Gallons of fuel per vehicle also fell, from 
859 in 1972 to 851 in 1973. 
And gas m ilea g e dropped from 12.o7 miles per gallon in 
1972 to 11.84 m iles per gallon in 1973. 
Texas figures show 7.8 m il­ lion v e h ic le s tr a v e lin g an a v e r a g e 1o,333 m ile s ea c h .

 ly. “ But when you work for the CIA you can do a lot of things you ar** not allowed to do. That’s why you operate in secret.” 

“Well, let me ask you this. 
Suppose half the break-ins in 
Washington were made by the 
CIA and only half were made by the common robber? How com e they never caught the 
CIA fellows?” 

“ The CIA crook has much better training for breaking and entering than the average man in the street. For one thing, h e’s a college graduate.” 

“ Well, let m e ask you an­ other question. If the CIA is involved in a breaking-and- entering job) does that make it a str e e t c r im e or a white-collar crim e?” 

“ T hat's a good q u estion , 
Custer. Why do you ask?” 
“ If it’s a white-collar crime and it’s been listed as a street crime, then maybe W ashing­ ton’s been taking a bum rap 
How do we know the biggest crimes in this city have not been committed by the government?” 

Government 

“ The biggest crim es in any city are always committed by the government, Custer. You should know that.” 

“ It still bothers me. Going into som eone’s home through a w in d o w so u n d s lik e som ethin g the W hite House would do — not the CIA.” 

“ M aybe,” I said, “ but let me ask you this. What would you do if you had all those people working for you out in 
Virginia and you could only afford to sen d a c e r ta in n u m b er of th em a b road ? 
Wouldn’t you tell them to go out and break into a home in

'Selma speed trap’ 

Sir: The term “ speed trap” is much used, but how accurately? 
Surely it has to be a rather ineffective “ trap” which allows countless thousands to go through it without being caught. ii is obvious that anyone can easily avoid the so-called “ Selma speed trap” by simply observing the posted speed limit. 
Now’, it may well be that Selma, to boost its revenue, has given inordinate attention to speeding motorists, but wherein has there been “ entrapm ent” ? 
And whether Selma took in $1o3,91o.16 or $1.oo in a fiscal year is beside the point, unless it can be established that the in­ dividual fines were excessive or illegally levied. 
By what convoluted logic is it an “ affront to the public" to require that a lawbreaker be penalized? 
Come now, a legal fine is not a “ ripoff” no matter how loud the wailing and grinding of teeth. And don’t we also know that the ticketed motorist’s main grips is usually that he got caught when 
“everyone does it” and gets away with it? 
I suggest it is a fact that a vast number of — possibly most — drivers have the idea that laws regarding speed limits are somehow not seriously intended, or are, at most, meant to be a sort of “ guide” — that when a speeding ticket is issued, especially on highways, etc., it is really ail arbitrary act on the part of the official. 
Albert C. Keller 

Give teachers credit 

Sir: I have never asked to have a letter printed but when I read the coward’s unsigned letter of school teachers, I had to reply for the hundreds of teachers who teach because they love the work, believe in public schools, and who seldom comolain of the inconveniences. 
•There should be stricter requirem ents to elim inate the writer’s wife who uses our profession to make spending money to buy a mink her husband can’t afford. 
She goes out to get away from boredom of housekeeping. She is not a scholar. She often is not fitted to deal with children. 
Those women who use teaching for their own benefit do great harm to children. 
I have taught for 38 years through depression w hen I was paid in script at $65.oo per month - at $115.oo and now I receive 
$1o,ooo. I have supported a family, ridden the bus. taken lunch to save a penny and educate my children. 
There is an army of dedicated teachers serving Texas, one of the wealthiest states, who receive pav scale in 38th place in the 
U.S. 
I want to ask Mr. Ignorance and Misinformed to please check out facts before he writes for public media. 
He might look back to see who taught his daughter to read, to cipher, and to think who taught her fundamentals of health. 
Yes. Even molded her character to be a good citizen. Who sat hours at a dance -- no extra time and half - for his daughter's prom. 
Before you write your legislator to set teacher’s* salaries at lowest rate and save your tax money — look at your lovely daughter — give the teacher credit for a “ job well-done."

Permissiveness 

Sir: Arthur R. Brient descries a commendation for his per­ ceptive com m ents (12-27) regarding the permissiveness of our times. 
Our society is in turmoil because too many people have a perverse idea of freedom. Freedom is not free. Every right is related to a responsibility. Liberty and freedom are endangered when people adhere to the quack doctrine that freedom means to do what they want, instead of doing what they ought. 
There is hardly a human problem which does not have a moral position. Rape is a serious offense, but the wearer’s of high-rise skirts are unwittingly inflamtning smoldering beasts. From 
Watergate to ripoffs, to running a red light - you name it - in varying degrees, there arises the moral choice of right and wrong. 
Religious values are being rejected and our time-honored moral standards are being replaced by the moral quackery called “ situation ethics". The women who holler about rape but defend abortion, are fine exam ples of the moral sickness called 
‘situationitis’. 
Every strand of our moral fabric must be defended if we are to be saved from the barbarians who demand rights but shun responsibilities. 
The legislators must be told to get off their fence straddling, and enact laws to restrain the malevolent forces who would destroy this country with their permissiveness. 
We are up to our eyeballs with human problems • moral problems - yet we have people who condemn the churches, and tell you that your government cannot legislate morality.

Texas and the speed limit 

Sir: With reference to your editorial of 28 December, relative traffic law enforcement by a bedroom community known as 
Selma. I also note Paul Thompson’s com m ent of the sam e date 
It is nothing short of amazing that you both are against law enforcement. Selma should be given a medal of merit. One only needs trave! to Houston, Dallas, Ft. Worth or San Antonio, and also Austin, to note that when within about fifteen miles of the city, traffic speeds up and those traveling at the legal speed limit are contused by the way speeders weave and pass the legal limit. 
We recently made a trip to southeast Arkansas via Louisiana, returning via Arkansas through Dallas to Seguin. Then almost immediately had to travel to Denver via San Angelo, New 
Mexico and Colorado. Texas was the only state that seemed to make no effort to enforce the fifty-five m ile limit. 
There appeared to he no traffic control in Texas whatsoever. 
During this period one Seguin student was killed outside of San 
Angelo and another seriously injured on the way back to college in Brenham. Both were close relatives of our neighbor. 
Why should there be one law for other sta tes and no compliance in Texas’.' We are ashamed of you and our favorite, 
Paul Thompson. May we have many more Selmas.

GOP’s Dixie dream fades out 

DALLAS—The sight of Robert S. 
Strauss, home for the holidays from his Washington base as Democratic national chairman, receiving the homage of conservative establishment businessmen as he lunched last week at the Dallas Club carries grim omens for lican party. 

These fellow T exans w ere lavishly praising Strauss for what they view as preventing at least temporarily radical control of the 
Democratic party. 
Whether Strauss really has accomplished that is less im ­ portant than the belief here that he has. 
In a city that was once the mecca of muscular conserva­ tiv e R e p u b lic a n ism in th e new South, it is now m argin­ ally more respectable to be a 
Democrat than a Republican. (

R epublican dream of party r e a lig n m e n t, c o n s e r v a t iv e southern D em ocrats throng­ ing to the GDP, is indefinitely postponed. 
Driven down by Watergate and the fa ilin g e c o n o m y , 
R epublican p ro sp ec ts have hit bottom in T exas as e ls e ­ where in the South—dreadful n e w s for c o n s e r v a t iv e id e o lo g u e s who p r ea ch 
R epublican ex p a n sio n on a southern base. 
Republicanism in Texas is pitiably anem ic con sid erin g e x p a n siv e d re a m s spaw ned 

 e a r ly in 1961 by the u p s e t election to the U.S. Senate of 
Republican John G. Tower. 

The 1974 election here r e ­ flected the national R ep u b ­ lican pattern—the worst loss for governor sin ce 1966; the defeat of one of the s t a t e ’s four R e p u b lic a n c o n g r e s s ­ men; the tiny state legislative delegation still tiny. 

But w hile sim ila rly g r im election results in 1964 w ere followed by a freshet of Texas 
Republican activity to regain 

 lost ground, there is indolence today. 

V o lu n te e r s , m o n ey and leadership have dried up. The state party headquarters in 
Austin has been cut in half, w ith re g u la r long d ista n c e telephone lines removed. 

B eh in d the red u ced p h y ­ sical activity is m alaise and depression. “ We wear Nixon and W a te r g a te around our necks like an albatross,” one v e tera n T e x a s R e p u b lic a n worker told us. 
Texas Republicans, feeling 

 betrayed for having so long trusted and defended Richard 
M. Nixon, have found no new le a d e r in P r e s id e n t F ord. 
“ The phrase you hear m ost about Ford is that h e’s “ in over h is h e a d ,” ’ said a 
R ep u b lic a n b u s in e s s m a n . 
After pausing, he added: “ I tend to agree with that.” 

W hen w e rep o rted from here a year ago, Republican lea d e rs still hoped for the p restig e and m a g n e tism of 
Republican convert John B. 
C onnally to lead e s t a b lis h ­ ment Democrats into his new party. 

Now under federal in d ict­ m en t, C onnally is fin ish ed fo r e v e r in p o litie s. 
Sen. 
Tower, thou gh h u g e ly popular, is a lone wolf without great interest in party affairs. 
The third prestigious T exas 
Republican, George Bush, is in far-off Peking. 
This sorry state of Repub­ 

 lican affairs has played intl the hands of Strauss and othei old-line D em ocrats wooing the establishment. 
T he m ere faut that th ei own Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, th essence of big Texas money can even be considered for th 
D e m o c r a tic p resid en tia nomination enhances the pal ty’s prestige with th establishment. 

But most important is the p resen ce in Austin of Gov. 
Dolph Briscoe, largely in ac­ tive but landslide winner of the s t a t e ’s first fo u r-yea r term. “ Dolph is like a 1o-ton m a r s h m a llo w in you r d r iv e w a y ,” c o m p la in s one 
Texas Republican. “ You can kick the hell out of it, but you can’t move it." 

Nor can you claim that the 
Texas Democratic party is a hotbed of radicalism with 
Briscoe, a conservative mil­ lionaire rancher, as its 
Headers.

Merry- Go-Round 

U.S., Soviet nuclear subs collide 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Wednesday January I 1975 

 derson 

WASHINGTON — Two prowling nuclear submarines, one American, the other Soviet, sideswiped one another under the North Sea on November 3. 

The bizarre undersea collision, which came within inches of sinking both subs, has never been revealed. But we have ob­ tained the details from on-the-spot sources. 
The USS M adison, a Polaris 
, subm arine bristling with armed 
[•nuclear missiles, was patrolling beneath the North Sea when, to the u tte r a s to n ish m e n t of the crew, the two subs scraped hulls. 
Both surged to the surface where 
.they inspected one another wari­ ly from a short distance. It could 
’have been an ugly incident, per­ haps a naval confrontation on the high seas. But the skippers of 
| both subs kept cool and moved off in opposite directions, with­ out any communications ex­ change. 
Not long afterwards, the Madison pulled into its base at Holy 
Loch, Scotland, with a nine-foot scrape along its hull. It wouldn’t have taken much more impact to have ripped open the hulls of both subs. 
There is confusion over who was to blame for the accident. 
Both subs should have been equipped with navigational gear, which should have detected the approach of the other. 
The Madison was on its first shakedown patrol after an over­ haul. But no defects had been discovered in the navigational equipment. 
If the collision had ruptured and sunk the two nuclear subs, according to our sources, there should have been no nuclear hazard. The nuclear gear in U.S. subs, they say, have enough protective encasing to prevent such a disaster. 
Footnote: The Navy refused to comment on the incident. 
Economic survey 
J 

We have sent reporters to different parts of the country to seek the human side of the economic story. 
On New \ o r k s fashionable East Side, for example, our reporter Randy Fitzgerald watched fur-coated women shop for their pets while limousines, with chauffeurs idling the engines, stood by. 
At one corner was a fancy shop, called Prestige Pets, which offered every imaginable grooming accessory for pedigreed dogs. Ju st, around the corner was another place, Animal 
Gourmet, which sold a variety of liver, lamb and other meats specially prepared for pam pered pets. 
A sign on the wall proclaimed: “ We do not prepare dog and cat food. We prepare food for dogs and cats.” Even birthday cakes were available for pets. 
The place was crowded with fashionable women, tempting their poodles and terriers with the exquisite food selections. 
Fitzgerald talked to one of the customers, a lady from Park 
Avenue, whose oversized black poodles pulled at the leash as she inspected the counters. 
She “ just couldn’t stand the street crow ds,” she told 
Fitzgerald, so she had her chauffeur drive the few blocks to the pct store. 
Had inflation caused her to cut down on the quality of the food she served her dogs? 
“ Heavens no,” she said. “ My pets deserve only the best.” 
Less fancy foods 

She acknowledged, however, that she was buying less of the fancy foods. 
“Why,” she exclaimed, “ I didn’t buy Frenchie (one of the impatient black poodles) a cake for her birthday!” 
“ Poor Frenchie,” she added, and she ran her hand playfully through the dog’s fur. 
Not far away, Fitzgerald saw a policeman chase a stray dog, with a rat in its mouth. Both the dog and the rat were part of the street scene in Central Harlem, where some 173.ooo people are crowded together in row after row of tenement houses. 
The streets are filthy. The houses are infested with rats. The people are not as easy to interview as the Park Avenue woman. 
They are wary of strangers carrying notebooks. 
Too often, men with notebooks turn out to be bill collectors or building inspectors. The residents know what it’s like in those tenements; they don't need building inspectors to tell them. 
Vet the people in Harlem aren’t unfriendly; they are merely suspicious. One black man, in his mid-4os, unemployed for nearly a year, told Fitzgerald he had seen enough of reporters and researchers who ask questions about poverty and people’s lives. 
“ They get told just what you will,” he said. "W hat good are all the words?” 
Watch on waste 

The Internal Revenue Service is planning to spend a million dollars on new furniture to embellish its Detroit offices. Already 
$538.oo(1 has been laid out for factory-fresh desks and filing cabinets. 
Yet the furniture that is being replaced is in excellent shape. 
An IRS spokesman explained that the old furniture will become part of a “ government-wide redistribution.” 
This conjures up a picture of usable furniture being shipped from government office to government office to replace other fu rn itu re which is also usable. 
Footnote: The man who has tried to block this waste, the IRS’s 
Detroit Administrator John Moffat, is now' being hassled by his bosses for his effort to save the taxpayers’ money. 

‘Happy new year—I’m CIA!’ 
S.A.’s no. I problem 

San Antonio is the 
1oth “worst city” in the United States, according to an arti­ cle in the January issue of 
Harper’s 
Magazine. 
In the feature story, entitled 
“The Worst American City,” author 
Arthur 
M. 
Louis ranks the nation’s 
5o largest cities in 24 categories 
— ranging from m urders per 
1.ooo residents to the num ber of public library books p er 
1o.ooo residents. 
Then, to determ ine a city’s overall national standing, he com putes the average of its rankings in the 24 areas and compares it with the other 49 cities. 
San Antonio ranks 41st — or 
1oth from the bottom. 
To ad d in su lt to in ju ry , 
Louis notes in his conclusions that “ the old c itie s of the 
Northeast dominate the lower portion of the list, while the cities of the West and South­ west generally rank highest.” 
That, of course, is true of most “ cities of the West and 
Southwest” 
— except 
San 
Antonio and El Paso (which ranked 37th). Dallas was 2oth, 
Ft. Worth 23rd, and Houston 
28th. 
Why? 

Why did the A lam o C ity rank so low 
B ecause am o n g the 5o c i­ ties, San Antonio was: 
49th in median income per capita ($2,421 - only El Paso was lower) 
48th in p e r c e n ta g e of fa m ilie s below p o v erty -in - come level (17.5 percent). 
46th in m e d ia n v alue of owner-occupied, single-fam i­ ly dwellings. 
47th in percentage of hous-

 ing units with 1.o1 or more persons per room 
(16.1 percent). 
45th in percentage of hous­ ing units lacking some or all plum bing facilities (5.2 p er­ cent). 
5oth in overall housing quality 
47th in p u b lic lib r a ry volumes per 1o,ooo residents. 
49th in overall “ am enities” 
(library volumes, num ber of hotel and m otel room s and places of am usem ent and recreation). 

Dreary 

Those dreary findings may com e as a s u r p r i s e to the m any San A n to n ia n s who partake of the good life that abounds for some in this community. 
But for persons who know the city well — who have vi­ sited the b a r r io s and the housing p ro je c ts and seen children's swollen bellies and senior citizens rum m aging in garbage cans — Lewis’ con­ clusions co n firm w hat has been s u sp e c te d for a long time, viz. that San Antonio is a dismal home for many citizens. 
Fortunately (or unfortuna­ tely — depending upon one s viewpoint) the H arper’s study doesn’t touch on many of the c o m m u n ity 's m a jo r p ro b ­ lems, e.g.: 
• An economy built around m ilitary p ayrolls and th e r ­ 

 efore precariously dependent on the vicissitudes of the body p o litic and th e fe d e ra l government. 
• 
A group of inequitable public school system s which assure that the fewest educa­ tional resources are placed in areas where children have the greatest needs. 
• One-sided development to the north of the city, which is le av in g the c o m m u n ity ’s other three sides (and down­ town San Antonio) bare of in­ vestment and growth. 
• 
Elected officials at ail le v els of g o v e rn m e n t who seem incapable of coping with the city’s ills — ranging from energy needs to downtown revitalization. 
Etc., etc. etc. 

Curatives 

All of th e se issu e s m u s t take a back seat, however, to 
San A n to n io ’s n u m b e r one problem : the seem ing a v e r­ sion of co m m u n ity le ad e rs 
(the “ establishm ent” if you will) to (I) adm it that the city has grievous ills and (2) pub­ licly call for and p riv ately fight for the radical curatives necessary for significant change.

A n to n io ’s problem s is unsolvable, but the solutions are complex and laden with political, business and social h a z a rd s w hich community leaders apparent- 
R e p o rt lab elled o v e rd ra w n 

WASHINGTON 
(AP) 
- 
Pentagon spokesman William 
Beecher said Tuesday that columnist Jack Anderson may have overdrawn his rejxrrt last week on the allegedly false advice given President 
Dw ight D. Eisenhower during the 1958 Quemoy-Matsu crisis 

 with the People’s Republic of 
China. 

The columnist said military leaders tried to force use of a nuclear bomb. 

Beecher, after answering 
"y e s" to a reporter's question 

 if the column were overdrawn, added that he did not “ want to be unfair" in responding to 
Anderson’s allegations. 
He said he is still reading the top- secret, 
6oo-page report on which it was based, but his affirm ative answer was based on “ what I have seen so far.” 

Iv aren’t willing to face. 
For instance, take the area of quality housing (where San 
Antonio rates last among the nation’s 5o largest cities). 
This past fall, while cover­ ing the activities of various n eig h b o rh o o d self-help groups on San Antonio’s south and west sides, I learned (and p u b lish ed the fact) th a t a large percentage of the city’s re s id e n tia l ey eso res and sub-standard 
* houses are owned by prominent citizens, real estate businesses and lumber companies. 

A concerted effort by com ­ m u n ity le a d e rs to apply peer-group or legal pressure on these landlords and force them to com ply with city health and safety ordinances could conceivably im prove the local housing situation dramatically. 
Pressures 

Of c o u r s e , o rg a n iz e rs of such an effort would expose them selves to counter p re s ­ sures from those who profit from such conditions. And that threat — plus apathy — have apparently kept persons and organizations in positions of power quiet on the subject. 
O th e r s im ila r ex a m p le s abound, but in each case the problem has either not been acknow ledged or when ack­ nowledged. has not been a t­ tacked by tough, courageous leadership. 
One of the few p ro b lem areas which has received at­ tention this past year is the c o m m u n ity ’s need for a c ­ celerated economic develop­ ment. 
Recently, a group of local b u s in e s s m e n form ed an 
E co n o m ic 
D evelopm ent 
F o u n d a tio n to a tta c k th at p ro b le m . S u p p o rte rs have lauded the new organization as “ a great leap fo rw ard ” while critics have predicted that it will simply “ nibble at the cheese." 
W hether or not the EDF is stro n g enough m edicine to cure som e of San Antonio’s ills an d p ro d u ce enough c h a n g e s to m ove the c o m ­ m unity’s name off the list of 
A m erica’s top IO worst cities remains to be seen.

Old time chevaliers about gone 

SAN FRANCISCO — Where did the year go, 
Claude? Most of it was a one-way struggle with W om en’s Lib. There are Women’s ” 
Libbers who expect you to open the door with your arms full of packages. 

Then they get hot at you if you stand up when they come to your table in the restaurant. 
“ What do women want?” pondered the great Freud. He never found an answer. 

★ ★★ 

The days of chivalry are not gone but they're getting mighty scarce. 
Only a few of us old tim e chevaliers left. Opening doors for ladies. Giving up your seat in the bus so some doll with legs like a piano can plant herself in it. 
T h at is ch iv a lry , 
F a ir 
Rosamund. When I was in knee pants, we were all taught such chivalrous things. 
“ Get up and give your seat to the lady,” grandm a hissed to me on the streetcar. When we got off she sniffed: “ Certainly used plenty of face paint. No better than she should be I reckon." 
“ Stand up when a lady comes Rito the room." said grandma. 
“ Mind your m anners.” 
This put a reflex in me that won’t let m e sit down at standup cocktail parties. No m atter how many chairs are empty. 
It has given me a back like you wouldn't believe. A spine like a stalk of five-day-old celery. M an’s backbone docs not improve with age. 

★ ★★ 

We d id not have co c k ta il p a r tie s w hen 
I was running sidewalk lemonade stands. 
Rum was a demon. We kept a small bottle of whiskey in the medicine chest for toothache. You held it in your mouth over the acher then spit it out. 
The drunkard's downfall started with a simple glass of beer. It was as simple as that. 
There were a few swingers in g ran d m a’s town who didn’t give a hoot. They drank corn whiskey whenever it was around. 
The preacher gave them what-for on Sunday. 
"T he drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a m an with rag s." he said. 

★ ★★ 

G randm a went to church Sunday. So did I. Stapled into a stiff collar that chewed at your neck. 
She said the sermons were not as strict as when she was a girl. 
She thought the preacher was too full of laughs when he stood at the door saying good-by to folks. 
“ It d on’t seem right for a p rea ch er to crack jokes.” she complained. She said: "D on’t squirm and fidget in your seat.” 
I don’t. I don’t get much chance to sit down. 

★ ★ Ar 

The cocktail party lady was SITTING. She patted the couch seat and said: “ Do sit down.” 
As soon as I sat (my aching back it was good) she said: “ Oh, my glass is empty. Don’t bother. ITI get it.” 
“ Allow m e," I said creaking to my feet. 
She said: “ I wonder if they could make me a Pink Lady? I adore th em .” 
Did you ever try to get a Pink Lady from a standup party cocktail bartender? Going mad trying to keep up with simple 
Scotch-and-soda orders? 
You wait your turn. Standing. 

★ ★ ★ 

I never questioned chivalry when I was swinging on a gate. 
G randm a grew up in a little Illinois town. The rules were rigid. 
Women did not paint their faces. There were some — “ the less said the better.” 
People did not get divorced. One woman did but. “ They ran her out of town right quick,” said Grandma. 
. “ Sit straight in your chair. Don’t_ put your elbows on the ta­ ble,” she said to me. “ Mind your P ’s and Q’s.’” 
I cannot slouch in a chair or put an elbow on the table to this day. 

“Look, fellas, I’m perfectly happy with the instant replays on TV!”

GEORGE W. KELLY 

 enforcement less stringent 
Law is 
'more lenient’ 

Enforcement of laws dealing with illegal aliens has becom e 
“ more lenient” in recent years, a retiring U.S. 
Immigration and Natur­ alization Service official said Tuesday. 
George VV. Kelly, an INS supervisory criminal investi­ gator. also said, “ Now, we are prosecuting only aggravated cases dealing with aliens. 
“ In the past, we prosecuted a larger per cent of the cases 
Hut our courts don't have en­ ough judges to prosecute il­ legal aliens and that’s why they are now everywhere.” 
Kelly, who retired Tuesday after 36 years with INS, said 
“ things have really changed” since he joined the service. 
“ Illegal ajjeris were very scarce then,” he said, “ but now they are everywhere.” 
He said economic condi­ tions in Mexico arc responsi­ ble for tile flood of aliens in recent years 
Penalize 
Kelly said the most effec­ tive way of solving the alien problem is federal legislation penalizing Americans who employ non-Americans. 
“ And we also need more immigration personnel,” he added. 
Kelly, 68. is co-author of the hook “ A Practical Spanish 
Grammar for Border Patrol 
Officers.” 
The book is the official textbook for the Border Patrol 
Training School. 
Kelly was responsible for investigating and prosecuting a smuggling case when some 
4(1 Mexican nationals were found in a van four years ago. 
Born in Uvalade, Kelly joined INS as a patrol inspec­ tor on the 
INS.-Mexico border. Four years ago, he was named supervisor in the criminal investigation division. 
He said he plans lo travel 
“ and catch up on some hunt­ ing and fishing.” 

Texas superport rejected 

AUSTIN (AP) — Texas’ top two elected leaders rejects! 
T u e s d a y a s p e v i a l c o rn rn i s s i o n ' s 
5-4 recommendation that the state go into the superport business. 
The vice chairman of the 
Texas 
Offshore Terminal 
Commission, Pete Miller of 
Galveston, had testified that 
Texas— instead of oil companies— should reap the estimated SFI billion 3o- year profit from a superport. 
But Gov. Dolph Briscoe and 
Ft. Gov. Bill Hobby said in a joint statement that they op­ posed state ownership of tlx1 offshore ports, which would handle foreign oil brought in on jumbo tankers. 
Briscoe and 
Hobby, however, urged other public bodies such as port authorities, or private interests, to apply at once to the U.S. Department of Trans­ portation to build a giant off­ shore port. 
Commended 
They commended federal legislation supported by 
President Ford which sets up a licensing process within the department. 
The nine-member commis­ sion, which was appointed by former Gov. Preston Smith, recommended last January that the state should build a superport, estimated to cost 
SIDO million, in the Gulf of 
Mexico 
26 miles from 
Freeport. 
The commission also asked 
Briscoe to call a special legislative session to consider tin* proposal, but the governor refused. 
Miller testified at a House committee hearing hest month the estimated $F4 billion profit would ease the burden on the state’s taxpayers if the port were publicly owned.

Bedsores present a problem 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: My wife had a stroke and now has developed a bedsore on her back. 
I would appreciate advice on how to relieve the pain, treat and heal the sore. — H.B.J. 
A bedsore can be a very serious complication in a person’s confinement to bed. Bedsores result from prolonged pressure on the body, and the most common site is the back, as in your wife's case, especially the lower back. 
They are usual­ ly provoked by- moisture in the form of perspira­ tion. urine, or stool, if the pa­ tient is incontin­ ent. Faulty nutri­ tion, not uncom­ mon in the elder­ ly and worsened by prolonged bed stays, can cause the skin to become more vulnerable to such pressure and moisture. 
The condition can be avoided by taking some simple, daily precautions. The cardinal preventive measure is turning the patient frequently onto one side or the other, every two hours, if possible. After the turning, you should stabilize your wife’s position in the bed with soft pillows. 
Her back should be inspected daily for any reddening areas, the signs of developing bedsores. Such areas should be cleansed carefully and dried thoroughly. If you use an alcohol rub, the arca should he dried and powdered afterward. Plain talc is good. 
You should expose the arca to dry heat. Use a gooseneck lamp with a 1oo-watt bulb 18 to '24 inches from the skin for from 2o to 3o minutes. 
Soft pads (sheepskin is good) should be kept under the lower back and under the lipper portion of the buttock. The pads should be laundered regularly . 
Remember that bedsores will tend to develop at points under greatest pressure, such as where bones protrude under the skin. 
Here are some other tips: 
Pay attention to your wife’s diet. Make sure she gets ample protein. A mixed vitamin supplement is essential. 
A water bed is helpful, and an inexpensive one can be made by- filling a common air mattress with warm water. But it should be a good sturdy air mattress. lf your wife's bedsore is only moderately ulcerated, you might try sprinkling it with granulated sugar, then cover it with a sterile dressing. 
Deeper ulcers should be treated by her doctor. 

Stomach removed 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I had three fourths of my stomach removed, and I have had my gall bladder taken out. 
I have tried to follow your advice to others that you give in your column — cating frequent, but small meals. Doctors have told me what not to eat But what I need to know is what foods I can eat — Mrs. LAM. 
Simple. Anything your doctors did not tell you not to eat. I don't intend that as a smart-aleck answer, lf you can't figure it out. just prepare a list of things you’d like to eat but are unsure about, and ask your doctor if he approves.

O, WOULDST I HAP A MARSHMALLOW

By JEA N E DIXON 

FOR THURSDAY 

YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY: 
You are more and more on your own as the year unfolds. A major move is the works and appears during the last. few months. Take precautions not to neglect people you will need later. Reaffirm recent health care resolutions. Today’s natives stock their minds with details, have a knack of organizing infor­ mation coherently. 

ARIES (March 21-April 19): 

Morning should be slow- paced. Some speculation is indicated in later hours. Your routines unearth a few minor surprises; bt* prepared to improvise and willing to ask or help. 

TAURUS (April 2o-May 2o): 

Perk up your outlook. Plan for progressive enterprises and make a calculated risk while working toward well­ defined goals. Cover your regular work efficiently. 

GEMINI (May 21-June 2o): 

Indirect channels are the only ones really open today; be prepared for delayed rewards. Sidelines clearly are useful. Let other people carry their share of concern 

CANCER (June 21 July 22): 

You have a break coming. 
You have special interest in and possibly profit from old possessions. Gather friends and loved ones for a quiet evening once you’ve complet­ ed your work 

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Be 

 bright and prompt as you take initiative to get your year started in grand style Ask that good question to find out exactly where you stand. 

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): 

Balance your words and deeds and assert yourself. 
Leisure time is subject to changes and may be spent with relatively new acquain­ tances. Don’t complain. 

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): 

You enjoy a v ictory over a rival by just being yourself and staying busy with routine work. Make sure you have all the proper papers for your property. 

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): 

If others lack your level of skill, do it alone. Travel takes you back to old times and is­ sues from which you learn how to manage a current challenge. 

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22- 

Dec. 21): Penny wise can well mean pound foolish today. 
Concentrate on what you must accomplish and don’t waste time on side issues or needless travel. Do some serious study in later hours. 

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 
19): Make the most of today’s beneficial influences. You meet unusual people or dis­ cover something interesting through a friend. Sign deals once you’re sure of details. 

AQUARIUS (Jan. 2o-Feb. 
18): 
Review your budget before mailing final commit­ ments on expensive journeys 
Consider the* details and al­ ternatives. Temporary stress shouldn’t lead you to end of long-time relationship. 

PISC ES (Feb. 19-March 
2o): You discover confiden­ tial information, but it isn’t complete. Indulge the whims of loved ones and other dose associates. Neighbors create some stir — don’t pay atten­ tion.

616.24 but still finished the year 27.6 per cent below where it started last Jan. I. 
That decline, on top of a 16.6 per cent drop in 1973, marked the worst cumulative loss in the popular average since 
1929-32. 
The New York Stock Ex­ c h a n g e com posite index gained .78 to 36.13; and the

Stock 
Exchange m arket-value index was up 

NEW YORK (AP) -T h e stock m arket celebrated the end of its poorest year since the 193os with a strong New 
Y ear's Eve rally Tuesday, stirred by expectations of broad new economic and en­ ergy m easures soon from the 
Ford administration. 
Some analysts said reports of lukew arm 'demand for gold bullion on the first day of its legal sale to Americans in 41 years also might have contrib­ uted to the advance.

Although the year just closed m arked the second year of one of the major bear markets in modern times, there were strong indications the bottom has been reached. 
As m easured by the Dow 
Jones In d u stria l A verage, stocks fell more points than even the G reat C rash th at began in 1929. But in term s of percentage, the decline has been smaller. 
The 1929 crash lasted three years and carried the Dow from 318.17 to its all-time low of 41.22, a trem endous col­ lapse of 89.19 per cent. 
Contrast 
By contrast, the two-year bear m arket has carried the 
Dow from its Jan. ll, 1973, 
Ihigh of 1o51.7o to a low close on Dec. 6, 1974, of 577.6o, a drop of 45.o7 per cent — only about half of the percentage loss of the 1929 crash. 
During 1974, the Dow lost 
(from Jan. I to Dec. 6) 273.26 points or 32.11 per cent from the 1973 close of 85o.86. 
The year 1974 was marked by a series of events and in­ fluences well calculated to discourage all but the most persistent bulls. 
Some of those bulls were sustained by the belief, or at least the hope, that the bear market ended in December. 
They base that belief on the

U.S. customers cautious of gold 

ASSOCIATED mss 
Am ericans-showed lots of curiosity, but spent little cash on Tuesday as they got their first chance since the depression to own gold bullion. 

Warren Lebeck, president of the Chicago Board of 
Trade, stands at a display of over $2 million in gold bars that were shown at ceremonies marking the opening of trading in gold futures Tuesday morning. —

European gold market shivers 

LONDON (AP) — The price of gold slumped on nervous 
European markets Tuesday, falling $5.75 an ounce in 
London. $7.25 in Zurich, $7 in 
Paris and $5 in Frankfurt. But 
London dealers showed little surprise over the day’s outcome. 
They noted the big 
American trading in gold for future delivery, considered here to be “ pure gambling,” and the sparse interest in actual dealing in gold bullion. 
It was the first day gold bullion legally could be sold to 
A m e rica n s since the depression. 
The dealers said they did not expect a trend to emerge for some days, possibly even after next Monday’s auction by the 
U .S . 
General 
Services 
Administration of two million ounces of Treasury gold. 
“ After 41 years, it is only logical for people to proceed cautiously,” one London dealer said. Another viewed the price decline as an initial victory for U.S. interests, including the government and some banks, that have been trying to “ talk down” gold as a safe investment. 
Dealers in Zurich said they believed gold had been over­ bought during the past weeks because of its spectacular rise to an all-time high Monday of 
$198 an ounce in London and 
Zurich and $2o1.4o in Paris. 

They said profit taking began late 
Monday and continued through Tuesday. 
Turnover in all centers was low, though, and the lack of buyers was partly responsible for the price decline. 
The dollar eased slightly on 
European foreign exchanges, apparently as a result of year- e n d b o o k k e e p i n g arrangements by corporations selling dollars to buy their own currencies. 
Gold was down 25 cents at- 
$192.25 an ounce when the 
London market opened, but it was down $3.25 at $193 at the 
Zurich opening. The price was fixed by the five London dealers at $187.5o in the morning and $186.5o in the afternoon. The closing level was $186.75. 
Zurich’s closing price was 
$189. 
In 
Frankfurt, the price dropped from $198.7o Monday to $193.75 Tuesday and the de­ cline was even greater in 
Paris 
— from $2oo.12 to 
$193.26. 
The slump in the price of bullion also extended to gold coins, with the one-ounce Kru­ gerrand losing $1o to $213.9o. 
Shares in South African gold mines declined in London too. 
The Financial Times index of gold mines shares fell from 
368.4 Monday to 353.5 at Tues­ day’s close.

 nation’s economic and energy problems in his State of the 
Union message a few weeks from now. 
Kenneth W. Johnson at the 
Minneapolis-based Piper, Jaf- fray & Hopwood also saw some possible bullish effects from the fact that “ the public didn t rush in to buy gold as 
1974 

 major banks reached a record 
12 per cent in early July, and remained at that level until 
Sept. 25. 
Thenceforth, in eight suc­ cessive weekly reductions of 
Va percentage point each, the rate was cut to IO per cent. 
Influences 
These disturbing influences gave way late in the year to increasing worries over recession, as gross national product adjusted for inflation fell for three successive quarters. 
The most persistent down­ trend in the Dow began in early August. By late Sep­ tember, the average broke through the 197o low of 631.16. 
But in the week ended Od. 
I a record weekly advance! was posted. The Dow ran up 
73.61 points, with 95,73o,ooo shares traded. 
Thereafter, there was a period of see-saw trading, in which the downtrend was resumed. 
But it still held above the- low of 535.76 posted 12 years earlier in 1962. 

 fast as the pessimists thought they might.” 
' 
Indications of mild initial demand for gold bullion c o u ld w e ll have been interpreted by traders as a sign that the investing pub­ lic’s view of economic pros­ pects were not as gloomy as some had believed, Johnson said. 
Texaco was the most-active issue on the Big Board, un­ changed at 2o7/g. 
Gold sticks finished widely mixed after a day of sharp and erratic swings. ASA, Ltd., was up 1% at 66%, and Campbell 
Red Lake gained % to 3o, but 
Dome Mines lost 1% to 43%, and Homestake Mining was down % at 36. 
Westinghouse 
Electric 
‘added % to IO on top of a iy8-' point advance Monday. Tile company has announced plans over the last few days to sell off its major appliance business and some European elevator operations. 
Stokely-Van 
Camp, which came in with sharply higher quarterly earnings, added 1% to 13%. 
Kaiser Industries, the Amex volume leader, was up % at

H o m e bill 

VAIL, 
Colo. 
(A F) 
- 
President Ford signed a bill 
Tuesday designed to help veterans get home loans and to open up the program more to the purchase of con­ dominiums. . 

Prices fluctuated, but the cost to the 
American consumer making a small bullion purchase generally was over $2oo per troy ounce 
(1.o97 regular ounces). 
“ The reports that we have are that demand was extremely slow and almost nonexistent.” said Thomas W. 
Wolfe, head of the Office of 
Domestic Gold and Silver 
Operations of the 
U.S. 
Treasury. 
He said he didn’t expect any upsurge in sales when trading resumes Thursday, after the 
New Year holiday. 
“ Thursday’s demand could be IO times what today’s was and it would still be far smaller than anticipated,” 
Wolfe said. He also predicted that the Jan. 6 auction of two million ounces of gold by the 
U.S. Treasury would further d e cre a s e demand by increasing supply. 
No speculator 
President Ford, on the ski slopes in Vail, Colo., was asked whether he would buy gold. “ No,” he replied. “ I’m not a speculator.” 
Trading began in an atmos­ phere of confusion and conflicting advice that prompted everything from wild demand in a few areas to a total lack of concern in others. 
“ We’ve encountered a wait- and-see attitude,” said Bob 
Mudwiider, the commodities specialist for Merrill, Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner & Smith in 
Louisville, Ky. 
Banks and brokers in areas including 
Wisconsin, South 
Da k o t a , 
Connecticut, 
Mississippi, New Hampshire, 
K e n t u c k y , 
In d ia n a , 
Tennessee, West Virginia, 
New 
York, 
California, 
Georgia and Massachusetts reported only light or moderate demand. 
In contrast, a spokesman at 
Metrolina National, a small bank in Charlotte. N.C., said: 
“ We’ve been so busy we haven’t had time to count the orders.” The bank took orders for gold bullion and promised to fill them Thursday at what­ ever price prevails on Jan. 2. 
Linking 
Many American dealers are linking their prices to the levels set in London, adding fees for a variety of items, including commissions and charges for fabrication or breaking down the gold from the 4oo-ounce standard size bar. 
The Delaware Trust Co. linked its price to a modi­ fication of the London figure, then added a 9 per cent com­ mission. The opening price was $191.5o per ounce, plus about $17 commission for a total of about $2o8.5o. The closing price was $187, plus 
$16.83 commission for a total of just under $2o4 per ounce. 
Delaware has no sales tax. 
The bank said it had sold just under IOO ounces of gold to 
3o customers by its 3 p.m. EST closing time. 
The gold dealing on Tuesday was the result of legislation enacted by Congress last sum­ mer to lift the 41-year-old ban on private ownership of gold except in the form of jewelry or coins or for industrial use. 
Some financial analysts said 
Americans were hoping the price would come down. “ I think business is very slow- on retail sales because the price is too high,” said Robert W. 
Holder, assistant vice president for Merrill Lynch in 
Spokane, Wash. “ If the price comes down to a more reasonable $15o an ounce or so, more people will be buying gold.” 
There is no central agency coordinating or regulating 
U.S. gold sales, although some financial institutions already under federal or state control have had limits put on their bullion dealings. 
The 
Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission proposed 
Tuesday- that prospective gold purcha­ sers trading with brokers or other dealers who will place an order for bullion be required to have 25 per cent of the purchase price on deposit at the time of the order and pay the balance within two days. 

The rules, which are subject to public comment before be­ coming final, are much stricter than those for stock purchasers who are not required to have any money on deposit before placing an order and who have five days to pay their balance. 

Even the experts refused to say how much gold would be sold to Americans or at what price. Estimates ranged up to 
$5 billion worth. 

Much of the early interest on 
Tuesday centered at com­ modity exchanges selling fu­ tures — contracts to be fulfilled at a later date. 

Texas gold rush slow 

 a sso c ia te d m u ss 
Prospecting investors found no gold rush in Texas 
Tuesday, the first day of legal gold bullion sales in this country in 41 years. Most d e a l e r s w ou ld not characterize the buying trend. 
Only two Dallas companies were dealing in bullion, Bache and Co. and the Merrill, Lynch firm. First National Bank said it will begin sales Thursday. 

Austin’s largest bank, 
Austin National, said the bank received about 3o telephone and personal inquiries about gold sales but by the end of the business day the bank had sold not a single ounce. 

Austin’s third largest bank, 
American National, said it would not deal in bullion be­ cause of the added expense, necessary security and other factors.

Aggie jokes i n New York? 

NEW YORK -T h o comedy writers in New York and Hol­ lywood are hoping that 1975 will he a funnier year than 
1974 
There will he more gags about stock market brokers, of course, hut how long can you keep laughing about peo­ ple jumping out of windows? 
And streaking isn’t funny anymore. Something much stronger is definitely needed by the harassed comedians. 
Maybe it will be in the dir­ ection of the Aggie jokes. 
I learned about the Aggie jokes on a visit to Dallas. 
I’m a farm boy myself and understand that some of the 
Aggies don’t like those jokes.

 been going around for years to the annoyance of Polish people. 
There was this Aggie who was such a slow reader he joined the Page of the Month 
Club. 
An Aggie galloping gour­ met was a farmer running after a garbage truck. 

No matter 
When an Aggie was asked whether he wanted white w inc or red, ho said, “ Don’t make no difference to me, 
I’m colorblind.” 
Another one said, “ I’d give my right arm to be ambidextrous.” 
One of them rushed home and said, “ Darling, we don’t have to worry about moving into a more expensive apart­ ment. The landlord has raised our rent.” 
“ I broke my arn) in three places,” one of the brethren said. His wife said, “ You should stay out of those places.” 
“ What do you think of marijuana?” . . . *it’s one of tho worst border towns I was ever in.” 

More 
“ What do you think of the 
Indianapolis 
5oo?” 
. 
. 
“They’re all innocent.” 
The teacher asked the little 
Aggie how he would spell 
Mississippi. Ile wasn’t sure so he said, “ Do you want the river, or the state?” 
Then there was the Aggie who thought a rebuttal was a fanny transplant. 
An Aggie got tipsy and fell off a 1o-story building. A policeman rushed to him and said. “What happened?” The 
Aggie said. “ Don’t know, of­ ficer. I just got here myself.’ 
Then there was the Aggie who was told to hijack a jet. 
So he brought back 
Joe 
Namath. 
The Aggie jokes are said to go hack to the 192os. Most 
Aggie students, so they tell me, tell these jokes on them­ selves and even invent some to be added to the paperback editions that arc published under the nam e of Gigem

All wrapped up in cord and yarn 

“ A Piece of S tring’’.,.in the famous story of DcM aupas- sa n t, e v e r y th in g h a p p e n s because of a piece of string. 
Well, you might be surprised to know how m u c h you can make happen with a piece of strin g . . . or gift co rd , or twine, or yarn, or just about any other tie-up. 

The idea is eord-eruft — using string plus glue. It’s so sim p le, m o st p r o je c ts are within reach of a kin d erg ar­ tener: you just wind, coil or wrap, and suddenly a pretty new object is born! 

As for the gluing, you can do it in two ways. You can fill a small bowl with glue and soak your siring in it to m ake it extra pliable while you work, stiff and hard when dry. 
For exam ple, to create a distinctive ornament, try this. 
Take colored cord, dip it in glue and w rap it around a balloon. W hen the s trin g dries, you just prick the bal­ loon and voila! You’ve got an airy, lattice-like ball to fill with fern or bright candies, or just to hang over a table. (I*.S. 
Before the string dries, you could even throw on some glitter.) 
For projects where the tex­ ture of the yarn is important, it’s better to glue right from 

 the bottle. Place mats, hot plates and coasters can be made this way, just by coiling and gluing heavy cord round and round till the desired size is reached. (For very young ch ild ren , this could be a four-hand project: two to hold, two to glue and wind.) 
Or, how about a vase or lamp base? Choose a hand­ somely shaped bottle, and simply wrap it with cord. Try different m a terials: heavy white twine for a cool con­ temporary look, bright yarns for th e gay look of folk-art—and you might even work in occasional beads. 

Patterns 

T ry d iffe re n t w ays of wrapping too: the basic wrap goes round and round, but you might try a spiral, or even add an up-and-down pattern. 
You can even use yarn to turn a plain, flat surface into som ething full of life and color—ju st by covering it with y arn designs. I f s -a pretty way to frame a m irror or a p icture— or even to make a picture from scratch. 

.So, if you’ve been saving bits of tw ine and s trin g , now’s your time to shine!

Rosemary caters a special party 

STRING, CORD AND YARN 

...m akes vase, place mats, 

 m irror fram e and coasters 

Rosemary Kowalski gave her first party last week. It was a first because the busy caterer was the hostess for this one aided by her daughter and son, Mary and Greg. 

A couple of y e a r s b a c k 
Rosemary bought a spacious home on King’s Highway that 
R o g e r R a sb ac h d e s ig n e d years ago. Roger was called on to rem o v e som e of th e walls and to completely redo the furnishings according to 
M ary’s ideas. 
C h ristm as evening, R o se­ m ary met one of her biggest c h a lle n g e s —a p a rty th a t tempted the appetites of some 
2oo guests surfeited with tu r­ key and dressing. 
The relaxed atmosphere of 
-the Country French furnish­ ings put everyone at ease. The 
Kowalskis greeted their friends in the living room , w here the walls were uphol­ stered in off-white linen just like the sofa and tete-a-tete. 
Lox 
Eight-foot screens set off the living room from the din­ ing room with its Hadley oak

 poolside patio was an assort­ ment of cheese wheels, the c h e rry -fla v o re d and th e grape-seed coated attractin g a num ber of nibblers. 
The huge oaks overhanging the pool, as well as those in front of the home, were taken into consideration when Mr. 
Rasbach drew up the house plans around them. 
Stained Glass 
As might be expected, the 
.ritchen was som ething sp e ­ cial from its parquet floor to the stained glass . ceiling 
“ skylight” . Mary created a glowing green, blue and or­ a n g e design to match the wallpaper. 
The showpiece was an a n ­ tique white and blue porce­ lain, wood-burning stove from 
Belgium. It was covered with a m e a t b o ard , and c o rn e d beef was served here late in the evening. 
Homemade chili bubbled in a huge copper pot on the m o­ dern stove for those who de­ sired it. An as so rtm e n t of copper pots and pans hung on weathered wood taken from the old Lackey S tab les in 
Brackenridge Park. 
Yule Lojr 
Desserts were lined up on a c o u n te r top —a G e rm a n cream puff tree, a whipped cream cake made into a Yule log with flaked chocolate, and a gingerbread house. 
Coffee was steam ing in a brass and copper sa m o \a r, one of s e v e ra l s a m o v a r s r a n g in g from an a n tiq u e 
Russian brass to a silver one. 
C o m fo rta b le fire p la c e chairs in the den were an in­ vitation to relax and watch the coals glow or look up at the antique carousel horse hang­ ing from the ceiling on a brushed chrome rod. Shelves covered with m irro r doors sheltered the TV. 
Before long, a blue g rass band began warming up the patio and dancing continued until early m orning. M ary

T here’s a party in the offing 

By DONNIE SMITH 

Mrs. Bob Holleron has been selected 
Hostess of the Year by San Antonio E x­ press and 
News readers-— in spite of the fact that she pooh poohs the idea that she does a lot of entertaining. 

Known for brilliant table decor which has won her numerous prizes, Mrs. Hol­ leron stresses that when she does entertain, she prefers small informal parties. 
But when she’s shopping or running across new cook­ books, she’s always planning ahead for any party that might be in her near future. 
In addition to what spon­ taneous entertaining she might do, Mrs. Holleron belongs to a gourmet group of four couples which she enter­ tains three times a year. 

She admits parties are a combined effort with her husband whom she considers the gourmet in the family. 

 dren. Mr. Holleron is retired from the advertising busi­ ness. He serves as executive director of Game Conserva­ 

 tion International. 
But after all is said and done, Mrs. Holleron says the most fulfilling thing she does 

 is work with the Prevention of 
Blindness. She enjoys most of all screening pre-school chil­ dren every fall. 

Mrs. 
Holleron 

Hostess of the Year 

One of their parties was writ­ ten up in Family Circle. 

Her fun is decorating. Right now she is on a play clay kick. 
She “builds” decorations free hand and then has them fired elsewhere. 

The hostess is waiting now for free time to study art and stitchery. 

Gardening is another of her loves, and she has her home surrounded with plants. 

Mrs. Holleron is a member of Agarita Garden Club, and though her husband is not a 
•garden club member, she 
;rcports the gardening in the atrium of their home is a joint effort — enjoyable blit time consuming. 

Mr. and Mrs. Holleron are parents of four children, and they have seven grandchil-

A “ people people” aptly describes Mrs. 
Waddell E. (Nancy) 
Bohman, 
Career 
Woman of the Year. 
She has a variety of ser­ vice-oriented jobs, titles, honors and thank you’s tucked under her belt. 
Mrs. Bohman came to San 
Antonio as a group-work per­ son for the national board of the YWCA. 
From I96o to 1965, she taught primary age children in a San Antonio school locat­ ed in what she refers to as a 
“pocket of poverty.” 
When Mrs. Bohman was attending night classes at St. 
Philip’s College, she realized she was getting older and that she had a special interest in a program for the elderly. 
The native of Kansas City, 
Kan., who describes herself as “always involved in people things because she derives so much pleasure from them,” next took on Project FREE, 
Family 
Rehabilitation 
Education Effort. 
It was formulated to ben­ efit older people — just the kind of job she was looking for. 
She laughingly recalls that another reason she took the job was because they needed someone” nutty” enough to 

 work 25 centers spread over 
San 
Antonio and 
Bexar 
County. 
FREE, a family service agency of the Office of Eco­ nomic Opportunity is expect­ ed to start its own indepen­ dent meals-on-wheels pro­ gram for the elderly the first of next year. 
The career woman de­ scribes FREE as the first multi-service program for the 
East Side. 
Since Dec., 1973, Mrs. Boh­ man has served as project director for the Metropolitan 
San Antonio Comprehensive 
•Nutrition Program which works with senior citizens.

Her hobbies are people-; oriented too, as her free time- is spent much like her work, time — in volunteer service. 
She also likes to travel.

Keep your weight down 

By MARY SLE MILLER 

A u th o ritie s co n stan tly report overweight as a m en­ ace to our national health. 
Reams of advice on the sub­ ject of weight control have been distributed. 

Yet overweight has in no way dim inished. Indeed it flourishes in spite of the m il­ lions of girls and women who try to reduce. 

What possible explanation can there be? It is not as though we do not know the main cause of overweight. As always, it’s overeating. And underexercising. 

The instances of obesity from other causes are rare. 
Some of them have not been proven out. The belief, for in stan ce, th a t you in h e rit weight has not been fully sub­ s ta n tia te d . 
M ore lik ely , what’s passed down arc your family’s fattening recipes and eating habits. 
Most of us take half m e a­ sures. We diet in a hit-or-miss fashion. If we exercise at all, our program is haphazard. 
We are motivated by appear­ ance reasons. Health is very seldom the incentive. F o r su ccess we m u st follow a healthful diet and ex ercise program. The word ‘‘health- fur’ is th e key. W ithout health, beauty is a Sometime thing.

Dear Ann Landers: 
Our son who is now 
13 years of age was born on Jan. I. 
I can think of no b e tte r birthday gift for him than a fram ed copy of your defini­ tion of maturity. It is one of the best sets of guidelines for living that I have ever read. 
It occurred to me that this d e fin itio n w ould be v ery helpful for those who have a desire to start the New Year with a fresh outlook on life. 
Will you p le a s e do th is mother a big favor and rerun it? A million thanks. — From 
California 
Dear Cal: Here it is — with pleasure. 
M aturity is the ability to control anger and settle dif­ ferences without violence or destruction. 
M aturity is patience, it is the w illin g n ess to pass up immediate Dleasure in favor of the long-term gain. 
M aturity is perseverance, the ability to sweat out a pro­ ject or a situation in spite of heavy opposition and discour­ aging setbacks. 
Maturity is the capacity to face u n p le a s a n tn e s s and frustration, discom fort and defeat, without complaint or collapse. 
Maturity is humility. It is being big enough to say, “ I was wrong.” And, when right, the m ature person need not experience the satisfaction of saying, “ I told you so.” 
M aturity is the ability to make a decision and stand by it. The im m ature spend their lives exploring endless possi­ bilities, then they do nothing. 
Maturity m eans dependabi­ lity. k eep in g o n e’s w ord, coming through in the crisis. 
The im m ature are m asters of the alibi. They are the con­ fused and disorganized. 
Their lives arc a maze of b ro k en p ro m is e s , fo rm e r friends, unfinished business and good intentions that so- 

 cupy such a prominent posi­ tion in your wedding when you have living male relatives. 
Confidential to Capsulize It 
For M e, Honey: 
E at less. 
Drink less. Worry less. Walk more. Give more. Resist the tem p tatio n to “ get ev e n .” 
Love that child who is least lovable. He needs it most. 
Love, sex 

Don’t flunk your chemistry 

 of maturity 

 test Love is more than one set of glands calling to another. If you have trouble making a distinction you need A nn’s booklet, “ Love or Sex and 
How To Tell the Difference.” 

Send a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request and 5o cents in coin to

Antonio Express, P.O. Box

Maturity is the art of living in peace with that which we cannot change. 
Wedding 

D ear 
Annn 
Landers: 
U su ally I th in k my w ay through to a logical conclu­ sion. but this “ problem” is too close to my feelings and I need an o u tsid e opinion. 
Yours. Please help. 
I v e been se ein g a psychiatrist for two years. He has helped me a great deal. 
Not only do I consider him a fine doctor but a good friend. 
My father has been dead for five years. I was never very close to my father but I miss him . My p s y c h ia tris t h as helped me think of my father in a more kindly light. 
Now the question: I plan to be m arried in a few months. 
Do you believe it would be proper to ask my psychiatrist to give m e aw ay at the wedding? 
I have two brothers and an uncle, but I feel much closer to my doctor than to any of my male relatives. What do you say, Ann? — Doing Fine 
Dear Doing: Ask a brother or your uncle to do the honors. 
By all m eans invite your doc­ tor as a guest, but it would not be appropriate for him to OC-

... it tells you how 
How to recycle 
Christmas trees 

By John Shuttleworth 
“ If your’re like me,” says 
Bonnie Rappel, “ you can’t imagine a holiday season without a genuine evergreen in the house. The only trouble is that I always used to wind up feeling guilty when it was time to throw our shedding 
Christmas tree away. But what else can you do with one?” 
Well, Bonnie — who lives up in Sidney, Montana and is a self-confessed “ conservation­ ist clear down to my big toe” 
— mulled that question over in her mind Christmas after 
Christmas without making any real effort to answer it. No real effort, that is, until a few years ago . . . when she saw thousands of yuletide trees on their way to the dump. “ There must be SOME way those evergreens could be used,” she told herself, “ and I'm going to find it.” 
Once she had made her decision to recycle the left­ over trees. Ms. Rappel could hardly wait to begin. She talked her husband and son into driv ing the family pickup truck around town ahead of the* city trash collectors and the two men eventually hauled over 3oo trees home before the sanitation department carted the rest to the dump. “ OR,” they said. “ The backyard is full of old Christmas trees. 
What do we do with ’em?" 

Compost 

“ Compost." said Bonnie. 
“ We ll run the trees through our shredder and add them to the compost pile.” 
It took only a few exasper­ ating hours of trying to chop up the evergreens with the shredder to cure Bonnie of that notion. She says, “ The task was so impossible that it completely quenched my enthusiasm for recycling 
Christmas trees. If it hadn’t been for a lucky accident, I d have let the whole idea die right there.” 
The Rappels, you see. had a small strawberry bed covered 
— to protect the fruit from birds — with chicken wire tacked to a wooden frame. 
“ While deaning up the yard after my recycling fiasco.” 

 remembers Bonnie, “ I idly spread some of the old yule­ tide trees over this netting and forgot about them until it was dry enough to water the plants. I then noticed, to my surprise, that the needles had nearly all fallen from the evergreens to form w-hat looked like the best straw­ berry mulch a gardener could ask for.” 

Ms. Rappel then shook the remaining needles into the bed. “ Why not?” she thought. 
“ Surely pine chaff will work as well as straw mulch.” 

As she soon learned, it worked even better. The nee­ dles — unlike straw — were free of weed seeds and tended to spread themselves evenly without any human assistance. 
Furthermore, the pine mulch (two inches thick) proved that it could keep the ground from drying during hot weather and — with only the addition of a little steamed bone meal — trans­ form sand into dark, fertile, humus-rich soil. Best of all, a taste test convinced the Rap­ pels that the needle-mulched berries were the biggest, sweetest and finest-flavored they’d ever raised. 
“ Naturally my enthusiasm was rekindled and I set about reviving my ideas for recy­ cling Christmas trees,” says 
Bonnie. “ Experiments the next year showed that I could make some of the yuletide discards retain their needles far into the summer by piling the trees up in a cool, shady area . . . and I considered that to be valuable information. 
“ Our strawberry bed. you see, happens to be on the south side of a building in full sunlight. It gets very hot there during 
Ju ly and 
August. Or it did. Now' I simply stack a number of old 
Christmas trees in a huge heap, take a few off as I need them and brace them up around the berry patch to 

Boyfriend refuses to give 

DEAR ABBY: I met a very attractive man at a club and we started dating. When he refused to tell me his last name, I assumed that he was married, but he assures me that he isn’t. 
/ 
Here is the story: 

1. He works for the govern­ ment 
2. He travels a lot. 
3. His job is to meet people and get information. 
4. When I asked for some identification, he said he didn’t carry any, besides, it wouldn’t be correct anyway. 
5. He is obligated to this job for at least two more years and cannot get married dur­ ing this time. 
6. He is licensed to carry a gun, but does not. 
7. He doesn’t have an “ ad­ dress,” but he does have an answering service. 

Abby, if this unbelievable story proves to be true, I would like to continue dating him as he is very good com­ pany. pleasant and well-man­ nered. However, if he is lying, 

B lf | \| dIII

 shade the plants. As the trees dry and shed, I replace the bare skeletons with fresh bushy ones.” 

Pine Needles 

The Rappels soon dis­ covered that their pine nee­ dles made an especially good mulch for any acid-loving plants. “ Once they’re well covered,” Bonnie notes, “ the beds of such growing things need only about a quarter as much water as their un­ mulched neighbors. And the pine chaff doesn’t blow away like sawdust, which is often recommended as a mulch. 
Besides, pine needles won’t track into the house on your shoes. That’s a big advantage over sawdust and compost!” 
Once the whole Rappel family was sold on recycling 
Christmas trees, they went at it in a big way. “ We protect dry spots on the lawn with a light sprinkling of pine nee­ dles during hot, sunny weather,” says Bonnie. “ We also recycle the trunks of the trees into fence stays by nip­ ping away the branches with pruning shears. The smaller skeletons are burned to provide potash for our gar­ den’s soil. We even throw a few trees out in the barnyard during the winter for our goats to nibble on . . . and they chew the mineral-rich branches right down to the trunk!” 
Now you may not have any goats around your house, and you may not want any. But it’s well worth saving a stack of discarded Christmas trees this year just so you’ll have an excuse to start a straw­ berry bed in the backyard next spring. After all, you’ll be recycling otherwise worthless castoffs . . . and stretching the holiday season at least until the middle of next summer! 

I will end the relationship immediately. 

How can I find out if he is really employed by the government? And if so, with which agency? 
This situation has me stumped. Any information you can give me will be very much appreciated. 
NEEDS TO RNOW 
DEAR NEEDS: The F B I. and C.I.A. both advise me that all bona fide agents have names which they use in their work. (Some have several. 
But each agent has creden­ tials in the name he is using.) 
Since this man refuses to tell you what name he is us­ 

 ing. you can consider him a phony. 
Both departments said that quite a few1 men tell girls this story to keep from getting involved; however, if they ac­ tually impersonate a govern­ ment agent, they can be prosecuted. 

DEAR ABBY: 
This is to 
-encourage “ Flat in N .J.” and all the other flat-chested wo­ men who read your column. 
At 28 years of age, I finally got the courage to have sili­ cone implants performed by a reliable plastic surgeon. Even though I had been married for many years and had children, 
I always felt inferior and self-conscious due to my flat 

 chest. The results were thrilling. I wish I had had it done ten years sooner. 
FLAT NO MORE 

DEAR FLAT: You have more bosom buddies than you know. 
DEAR A BBY: I am a schoolteacher who is very tired of being put down. Re­ cently someone called me (and my fellow schoolteachers) 
“ glorified babysitters.” I sat down and calculated exactly what I earn if I were actually a babysitter. 
I have 42 students. If I were to charge 5o cents an hour 

(which is the very least any * babysitter would, I would make $21 an hour. 
Allowing one hour off for lunch (although teachers sel­ dom get an hour off because they are required to lunch- supervising duty during their lunch period) I would get $21 times five hours, or $1o5 a day, times five, or $525 a week. Or on a four-week, 
1o-month basis, $21,ooo per year! 
Babysitter’s fees look aw­ fully good to me.

UR HEALTH By I. I. Lam b, M .D . 
Heart muscle needs potassium 

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— W ednesday January I 1975 

DLAR DR. LAMB — My hus­ band is taking a diuretic for high blood pressure. His doctor recom m ended that he take potassium chloride with the medicine twice a day. 
I have read that potassium chloride may be dangerous and cause heart irregularities. Can this substance build up in the body a fte r taking it- con­ tinuously? How would one know if he’s taking too much? 

Relax 

DEAR READER - Relax. 
As long as the kidneys are working reasonably well, they will eliminate any potassium the body doesn’t need. It is c o m m o n to g iv e e x t r a potassium when a patient is taking a diuretic. Diuretics work by causing the kidneys to elim inate sodium salt through the kidneys and the water goes with the salt. The problem is they often wash out too much potassium salt, too. 

Loss of potassium can lead to irregularities of the heart. This is much more common than any problem related to too much potassium. 

Potassium is the main salt in­ side our body cells. Sodium salt is the main salt outside our cells in the body fluids. It is cer­ tainly not a dangerous medicine in patients with normal kidney function. 
Most fruits are excellent sources of potassium. A couple of eight-ounce glasses of orange juice a day will contain about as much potassium as your hus­ band is getting. That will tell you how safe it really is for him. 
DEAR DR LAMB - Much has been written about the drug 
Gerovital H3 which Dr. Ana 
Asian of the Geriatric Institute, 
Bucharest, has been using with rem arkable success in retar­ ding and minimizing the aging process. 
Would an elderly person who is in splendid health, active, 

 and agile and wishing to remain | so for several m ore years benefit from using this drug? 

DEAR REA DER - How successful Ana Aslan has been in using Gerovital to retard the aging'process depends on who you talk to. Her results were sufficiently suspect that the drug was banned from entry into the United States for years. 
It is still allowed in only for ex­ perimental use in studying its effects on other problems. 
Many of Dr. Aslan’s patients were neglected older people. 
Her total program did appear to help these people. The catch is that regular exercise, improved diet and a renewed interest in life will do remarkable things for neglected older people, even without any medicines. It is possible that most of her results were from such m easures. 
There is no reliable evidence that Gerovital does anything at all to retard the aging process. 
Gerovital is really a chemical related to, or the same as, the medicine often used by dentists to deaden pain. She claims a minor variation in the prepara­ tion improves its usefulness, a claim some state is sim ilar to statem ents about the different lev els of e ffe c tiv en e ss of different brands of aspirin. 

Useful 

There is some evidence that 
Gerovital is useful in treating depression. That may be the secret to its effects on older people. Many older people do suffer from depression and any medicines that relieve this con­ dition are useful, but this isn’t exactly retarding the aging process. 
If you feel fine and don’t have a tendency to have depression, I would think you would be wasting your money on a false hope to use Gerovital.

Lamb in care of the San An-. tonio News, P.O. Box 2171,

Opening lead—K A 

By Oswald & James Jacoby 

Happy New Year readers! 
We are going to start the year off with the simplest squeeze play there is. It is so simple that the only read way to avoid working it is to give up and con­ cede down one, because you are only looking at nine top tricks. 
South might double West’s four-club opening, but no one can blame him for his four- spade bid. 
Things don’t start out well since West cashes three clubs right off the bat. Then it doesn’t m atter what he shifts to. Sup­ 

 pose he leads a trump as is most likely. South simply runs off all his five trumps and dis­ cards a small diamond from dummy. That leaves South with two hearts and three diamonds w hile dum m y holds th ree hearts and two diamonds and poor East holds his head in pain 
He has to come down to five cards also and must unguard one of his queens. It doesn’t m atter which one. If South counts he will know whether his 
1oth trick will be scored by his third diamond or dum m y's third heart. 
Can the squeeze be missedo 
Yes. If South refuses to cash his last trump the squeeze just won t have developed.

OLEAN, N.Y. (AP) — Seventeen-year-old 
Anthony Barbaro, a high school senior ac­ cused of three sniper slayings, was arraigned 
Tuesday on three counts of second-degree murder. 
“ Those were the highest charges we could bring,” said Dist. Atty. Richard Dawson of 
Cattaraugus County. 
New' York’s new penal 
World leaders eye a new year 

 code limits first-degree murder, a capital offense, only to murders of policemen or prison guards. 
A plea of innocent was entered for Barbaro at the brief proceeding in city court, a day after the two-hour siege at Olean High School took the lives two men and a woman and injured ll other persons. 
Police said Barbaro fired at least three rifles from a school window before they broke into a barricaded third-floor room and found him overcome by tear gas. A gas mask police s a id he w as w earing apparently was defective. 

ASSOCIATED PRISS 
Leaders around the world gave these views and hopes for 1975 in 
New Y ear’s speeches and statements: 
• President Valery Giscard d ’Estaing of France said he hoped that in 1975 his country would .continue to offer the w orld 
“ evenhandedness, tolerance and conciliation.” 
In a televised New Year’s speech he said he wanted the government to give special at­ tention to wortong conditions and certain groups hurt by in­ flation or otherwise dis­ advantaged. “ I thus wish that 
1975 is the year of fraternity and in this way France brings to each and every one one of you the feeling of belonging to a warm, living and fraternal comm unity.” 
• Turkish President Fahri 
Koruturk said he regretted that Turkey’s political crisis rap into the new year and hoped a strong ruling power and strong opposition would em erge, from possible new elections. In a conciliatory gesture to the Greek and 
Greek-Cypriot leaderships, he said, “ We consider it a further security that the sides directly involved in the 
Cyprus question now seem reasonable persons of common sense, devoid of emotional atti­ tudes.” 
. 
• In SaiLbury, Rhodesia, 
President Ian Smith, head of t h e w h i t e m i n o r i t y government, said of 1975: “ I regret to say there will be some hardship.” 
Smith said last year had 
. taught that no country can in­ sulate itself from the rest of the world. “ Even the biggest and strongest have had to revise their thinking on this issue,” he said. Regarding p r e s e n t m o v e s for ’ a settlem ent between whites and blacks in Rhodesia, Smith said, “Our policy is that for all tim e Rhodesia will be the 

 home of w'hite Rhodesians and black Rhodesians.” 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the president of Chile, said the country ended the past year t h r e a t e n e d by 
“ Soviet c o m m u n i s m ” and could expect more of the same in 
1975. In a speech over radio and television, he said: “The c a m p a i g n of 
S o v i e t communism has searched all avenues to produce the ruin of 
Chile through isolation. 
During 1975, it Will look to increasing the campaign and will a t t e m p t to utilize g o v e r n m e n t s a n d i n t er n a ti o n a l institutions which, tricked or infiltrated, are available for such action.” 
• Swiss President Pierre 
G raber said top priority in n e u t r a l 
S w i t z e r l a n d ’s domestic policies must go to t h e f i g h t a g a i n s t 
“ dem oralizing, unjust and brutal inflation.” He said it would be wrong to think that inflation will guarantee full e mp lo ym e nt and added, 
“ Unless we fight it, inflation threatens to annihilate all our social accomplishments.” 
• British Prim e Minister 
Harold Wilson said 1975 would be a year “for rebuilding our strength and not for spending it.” He appealed to 
B rita in ’s labor unions to restrain wage demands, avoid strik e s and work harder during the coming year. 
“ Any attempt by a sectional group to obtain a short-term gain for themselves will be to the immediate disadvantage of all of us,” he warned. 
Soviet leaders promised an improved living standard and efforts toward strengthening world peace in their New 
Y ear’s greeting to the people of the Soviet Union. They also pledged to further develop the 
Soviet economy, science, cul ture and the nation’s defense capability. 
The 
Chinese government told its people it expected g r e a t e r e c o n o m i c achievem ents in 1975. 

Parents waited 
Mr. and Mrs. Ned Barbaro waited nearby in the city clerk’s office when the hand­ cuffed, T-shirted defendant ap p eared 
Tuesday before 
Judge Jam es Crowley to enter a plea. 
Crowley ordered 
B arbaro held at the county jail and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Friday. 
Dawson said he believed that a county grand jury would re tu rn additional charges in the deaths of 
Carmen Wright, a 25year- old motorist; Neal Piton, 58, a pedestrian gunned down in the street, and E arl Metcalf, 62, a’ school custodian. 
Rifle team 
Barbaro, the eldest of four children of a local manufac­ t u r i n g e xe cut ive , was described as a bright student and the third-best marksman on the school’s rifle team. He has been a member of the team for three years. 
D a v i d 
L a v e r t y , a team m ate, recalled Tuesday t h a t he and 
B arb aro som etim es 
“joked about holing up in the armory with all the weapons, you know — sort of a stand-off thing." But he added, “ This was all a bunch of talk.” 
Jim Leon, 15, another team­ m ate, said Barbaro “ liked to read books about war, he liked w ar films.” 
School principal Louis Nicol described Barbaro as “quiet, m ore or a loner than not,’’ and said the youth was not a dis­ ciplinary problem . 
Nicol added, “ He was a real good shot.” 
Of the l l injured persons, eight apparently were struck by bullets or fragments of bul lets, authorities said. The oth­ ers were hit by flying bits of glass. 
One of the wounded was 
Julius Wright, 12, a brother of 
M r s . 
Wright.

 for tim e ran out 

DALLAS — Time has run out on both me and 1974. 

A wise old newman once said that the most important thing a columnist should do every day is tend to his column. 

But alas, that wise old newsman failed to say what to do when time runs out and the column isn’t written. At this moment I’m typing in Room 1221 in the Downtown Holiday Inn, headquarters tor the Cotton Bowl. A nice lady from Western Union has promised to wait 3o more minutes to dispatch my message l ack to San Antonio but she is tired and already overdue her leave. 

So I type in great haste. Biggest trouble with columns that take only 3o m inutes to type read exactly like 3o-minute columns. 

Sometimes the problem is a lack of subject matters but that’s not the case today. Lordy, I’m all broke out with subject. Ifs just the shortage of time. 

The subjects are so plentiful you might accuse your tour con­ ductor here of name-dropping but the quickest way of getting the job done here might be to reconstruct the day, explaining just why I don’t have time for this column. 

First off, Lamar Hunt called for a Hall of Fame board meeting at 9 a.m. this morning. He called it on very short notice and at a hotel many blocks from the pad I’m in. 

You know Lamar Hunt. He owns the Kansas City Chiefs, Hunt 
Tomato Catsup and a whole bunch of things in between. He’s general chairman of our Texas Sports Hall of Fame Develop­ ment Fund and your humble correspondent here serves on the board. 

My only contribution to the meeting was to make a motion that our next meeting be later in the morning or early in the afternoon. It died for lack of a motion but Mr. Hunt smiled my way. It wasn’t a real warm smile, however. 

Probably the same sort he gave Hank Stram last week. 

Highlight of that session came when a photographer appeared and snapped half a dozen pictures. I can hardly wait for the prints to show my co-signers and creditors a photo of me standing just two feet from Lamar Hunt. That should be worth renewals on both MasterCharge and BankAmericard.

IS l i p for the Bears 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DALLAS — Penn State quarterback Tom 
Shum an said th ere is no d an g er thee* seventhranked Nittany Lions will be overcon-' fident against 12th rated Baylor in the Cotton 
Bowl Classic New Y ear’s Day because “ our team has a bunch of hot dogs who always play better on television.’’ 
“ We’ve been on television three times this year and won all three of th e m ,” said 
Shuman, who led the Nittany 
Lions to a 9-2 record and the 
Lambert Trophy symbolic of 
E astern college football supremacy. 
“ No team is hard to get up for when the game is on TV,” said defensive end (Jreg 

BAYLOR DEFENSIVE LINE COACH BILL LANE LOOKS DOWN LINE 
...as the Bears prepare for today’s meeting with Penn State 
Pardee named coach of Bears 

Just 2o minutes after that meeting ended our annual Hall of 
Fame luncheon started in the same hotel. 

The four new ones inducted were the late Bill “ Jitterbug” 
Henderson, Lee Trevino, Raymond Berry and Randy Matson. If you don’t know who those folks are you just haven’t been paying attention to our sports pages. 

At any rate, it was one of those fantastic affairs that drew’ the great and the near great, not to mention 8oo paying customers. 
Guys like Davey O’Brien and coach Matty Bell, both already inducted into the Halt, were in the audience, not to mention the 
Baylor and Penn State squads. 

As the in-coming president of the Texas Sportswriters As­ sociation it was my privilege and honor to make the plaque presentation to Mrs. Evelyn Shaw, the former Mrs. Henderson. 
That got me a spot at the head table, right next to Kyle Rote, who did the presenting to Berry. 

It was difficult to assume a natural and comfortable pose while sitting at the middle of the head table. Really, I was in over my head and I knew it. The whole affair was so elegant and star-' studded. 

But I only thought that. It took Trevino to say it. 
When Lee got up, after a thundering ovation, he said, “ Good­ ness, isn’t this a nice place? Not too many years ago I just wanted to work as a waiter in a place like this.” 

Byron Nelson, who laid some heavy verbal strokes on Lee while presenting his plaque, called Trevino “ the most generous man we’ve ever had on the professional golf tour.” Then Lord 
Byron told how Lee gives of himself in both time and money to so may charities and how so few of those deeds are even publicized.

O v erflo w trow el 

The luncheon attracted an overflow crowd, the biggest since 
Notre Dame first played in the Cotton Bowl and three of the old 
Four Horsemen made brief talks. 

It ended around 2:3o, just leaving enough time for some of us to head back here to the Downtow n Holiday for our winter Texas 
Sportswriters meeting. 

That was one I had to make because, as mentioned, old dad here took over the presidency in that session. 

Things got a little sticky and we stayed late, trying to end an argument over an increase in membership dues. Sportswriters spend months writing about million dollar deals in various athletic fields and often we talk of studs who draw salaries of 2oo thou per. But when it comes time to raise a member’s annual dues a lousy two bucks you can’t imagine such bickering. 

Really, I hate these columns that start with “ I” and end with 
“ me” but it’s all I could think of for a 3o-minute chore. The nice 
Western Union lady is waiting downstairs and now my wife tells me to dress for the New Year’s Eve Cotton Bow l party. Like 
I said, my time is up. 

Happy New Year. 

CHICAGO — Jack Pardee, who coached the payless Florida Blazers to the brink of the fledgling W orld Football L eague c h a m ­ pionship, was named coach of the Chicago 
Bears in hopes of leading the founding entry of the NFL back to respectability. 
P ard ee, 38, played from 
1957 to 1972 in the NFL as a linebacker with the Los An­ 

 geles Rams and Washington 
Redskins. He was an assistant coach w ith Washington in 1973 

COACH JACK PARDEE TAKES BEAR HELM 
...replaces fired Abe Gibron at Chicago post 
Longhorn nucleus back next year 

 before joining the WFL entry in 1974. 
The signing of Pardee was announced by a 
Bears spokesman who said neither 
Pardee nor B ears officials were available for comment. 
The statement quoted Jim 
F inks, 
B ears general manager, as saying, “ I am not closely acquainted with 
Jack but I am familiar with his background and have heard nothing but the best reports about him. 
“ He has the temperament and disposition to be a suc­ cessful coach in the NFL for years to come and is the type of man who can lead the 
Bears back to where they belong,” Finks added. 
Pardee Statement 
P ardee said in the statement, “ I am proud to Pe new head coach of the Bears. 
They have the greatest tradi­ tion of all in pro football and I am looking ahead eagerly to the 1975 season.” 
Terms of Pardee’s contract were not announced. 
Pardee was reported to be at his home in Orlando, Fla., but his wife, Phyllis, reached by telephone, said her hus­ band had not yet arrived. 
“ We’re d e lig h te d ,” she said. “ We just heard a few minutes ago. We wish he were home now to give him a big hug and a kiss.” 
Mrs. Pardee said her hus­ band had been approached by several other clubs for coaching jobs but she declined to name them. 
She also declined to say if 

 her husband actively sought the B ears job after Finks fired Abe Gibron several weeks ago. 
She said Pardee and other members of the WFL Florida 
Blazers had not received paychecks for the past four months. 
“ When he called, he just said, ‘Well, guess what, we have a jo b ,’” Mrs. Pardee said. 
Gibron was fired after finishing the 1974 season with a 4-1o. 

Live action from the Cotton 
Bowl begins at I p.m. on 
Channel 5, CBS TV. 

Murphy. “ You’ve got all your relatives watching and if you play lousy the New York papers get on you.” 
Asked if he was one of the team’s “ hog dogs” , Murphy replied “ I don’t think I ever would have been noticed if I h ad n ’t been a hot dog. I deserve it. I worked for it. I earned it.” 
National Image 
Penn State players have been sensitive most of Cotton 
Bowl week about the national image of the Nittany Lions. 
“ We could have beaten anybody in the nation last year and still ended up fifth.” said Shum an. “ We had an 
11-o record, too.” 
Murphy said “ The pressure is alw ay on us not matter who we play because we’re Penn 
State—like we have to always prove something.” 
Fullback Tom Donchez said 
“ It seems like everywhere we go, people don’t believe in us. 
I think the polls show this. 
W’e ’re an E astern team , surrounded by the Colgates 

 and Browns. We don’t play people like Oklahoma and 
Texas back-to-back during the season.” 

Baylor tailback 
Steve 
Beaird said “ I think we played two or three team s during the year better than 
Penn 
State. 
In our conference, Texas and Texas 
A&M were better.” 

“ I don’t know why someone would say that because with a few breaks and a few points we could been 11-o again,” 
Shuman said. 
Murphy has taped Beaird’s remarks to the dressing room mirror. 
“ Those kind of rem ark s have been getting our atten­ tion.” Murphy said. “ They say they played three better teams than us but didn’t say they lost to those teams.” 
Penn State, 9-2, is a four- point favorite over the Bears, who are re p resen tin g the 
Southwest Conference for the first time as the host team in the Cotton Bowl. Baylor’s 8-3 record was the first winning season in ll years and the 
SWC title was the first time the private Baptist School had captured the crown in 5o years. 
Workouts have been ham ­ pered by cold, rainy weather but both Penn State Coach Joe 
Paterno and Baylor Coach

Carter lawyers seek reversal 

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) 
— 
L aw yers for 
Rubin 
“ H u rric a n e ” C a rte r have asked New Jersey Superior 
Court Ju d g e Sam uel A. learner to reverse his ruling denying the former boxer and a co-defendant a new trial for a 1968 triple murder. 
In papers filed Monday, the law yers, who recently replaced a defense team from the state Public Advocate’s office, contended that at least lour m ajo r points were inadequately covered at the original hearing for a new trial in October. 
The 
P assaic 
County prosecutor’s office, which handled the original prosecu­ tion of Carter and John Artis for the murders in a bar in 
Paterson, said it would op­ pose the second motion for a new trial as it did the first. 

The judge was on vacation 
Monday and there was no in­ dication of when he would rule on the new motion. 

After the first hearing. 
Ju d g e Lamer ruled that recantation^ by two key wit­ nesses, who said they had lied when they placed Carter and 
Artis at the scene of the crime, “ lacked the ring of truth.” 

The new defense team ar-, gued that the hearing should be reopened to allow fuller substantiation of the recants-' tion by witnesses Alfred P. 
Bello and Arthur D. Bradley; to hear fu rth e r evidence relating to promises allegedly made to the two witnesses by the Passaic County Prosecu­ tor’s office; and to hear how the defense at the 1967 trial was affected. 

JACKSONVILLE, 
Fla. 
(AP) — The Texas Longh­ orns’ debut in the Gator Bowl football game was a debacle, but they aren’t planning to come back next y ear to avenge Monday night’s 27-3 loss to Auburn. 
This is a young team with every expectation of going back on top of the Southwest 
Conference and into the Cot­ ton Bowl, where they spent the past six New Year’s Days. 

“ We return a pretty good nucleus.” said Texas Coach 
Drrell Royal. “ We don’t lose much offensively.” 

The entire starting back­ field returns, and 225-pound fullback Earl Campbell will be on hand three more years. 
The powerful freshman led the fumbling Longhorns in rushing during the season and in the Gator Bowl game. 
He was named most valuable player on the losing team. 
Campbell gained 91 yards although he said “ I just couldn’t get a takeoff on the grass.” 
Texas had not played on natural turf for a year and a half, and Royal said "maybe that’s why we slipped on the 
Gator Bowl turf more than 
Auburn.” 
Quarterback Marly Akins, running a keeper play on fourth down at the Auburn nine-yard-line, slipped to the] ground for a loss of a yard shortly before halftime with 
Auburn leading 16-3. 
” 1 had a standup touch­ down if I hadn’t slipped down,” Akins said. "T hat’s 

 the big play of the game as far as I am concerned.” 
Auburn 
Coach 
Ralph 
“ Shug” Jordan agreed it was a key play. 
“ lf they scored then, it would have made them only six or seven points behind for the third quarter,” Jordan said. “ It could have turned things around.” 
Auburn made as many tur­ novers as Texas—seven—but they came mostly in Texas territory where they were less costly. Every Auburn score except the first touch­ down started with a Texas mistake. 
Running back Mitzi Jack­ son, who scored A uburn’s second touchdown on a two- yard dive, fumbled one yard short as he appeared to be going in for another in the second quarter. 
“ The ball was wet; the field was wet, and my pants were wet.” Jackson said. “ There wasn’t any place to dry our hands and the ball was as slippery as I’ve ever seen it.” 
Auburn returns a good nu­ cleus of players for next year. 
T hat includes sophom ore quarterback Phil Gargis, who threw touchdown passes of seven and 14 yards to wing­ back Ed Butler. Gargis was named most valuable for the winners. Butler, a junior, also will be back. 
’’We’ll have a good team next year,” Jordan said. 
Sixth-ranked Auburn’s fin­ ished at 1o-2. Texas’ final 8-4 record represented. the most losses since 1967, when the 
Longhrns were 6-4.

LAUREL, Md. — The New Year’s Day rac­ ing card at Laurel Race Course was cancelled on Tuesday because of a threatened strike by mutuel clerks, guards and other workers. 
A nnouncem ent that the final day of the winter meet at 
Laurel would be c a n c e lle d * was made by a spokesman for 
•John 1). S eh a p iro , track president. 
M arylan d ra c in g is scheduled to move to Bowie 
Race Course on T h u rsday, and Mike Abel, secretary of the Independent Association of Race Track Employes Inc., said the walkout probably would shift to Bowie. 
Union members voted 389-9 at a Monday night meeting a g a in st an o ffer by the m a n a g e m e n ts of L au rel, 
Bowie and P im lic o R ace 
C ourse, the s t a t e ’s three m ajor throughbred tracks, and a g reed to strik e New

The m a n a g e m e n t offer rejected by the workers would have raised their daily wages an average of $l in each year of a two-year pact. The union has called for $5 daily raises for each of two years, plus increased fringe benefits. 
Management contends that the workers w ill be getting an autom atic 19 per cent pay in crease in 1975 b ecause 

 yearround racing begins in

Rose Bowl is Revenge Bowl for Southern Cal. 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PASADENA, Calif. — Southern California is after revenge on two counts when the Trojans meet Ohio State here Wednesday in the Rose 
Bowl before an expected record college foot­ ball crowd drawn by the lure of the nation’s two top-rated players. 

The Trojans seek revenge because they lost 42-21 to the 
Buckeyes in last year’s New 
Y e a rs 
Day c la s s ic and because Ohio State’s Archie 
G riffin won the H eism an 
Trophy as the nation’s outs­ tanding football player this year by out-balloting Trojan tailback Anthony Davis.

The T rojans feel they and 
Davis are the best, but odds- makers have installed the na­ tionally third-ranked 
B u ck ey es as six-point favorites at the 2 p.m. (PST) kickoff. A crowd of 1o7,oo(1 is expected.

 hometown crowd should “ be worth at le a st two to u ch ­ dow n s.” (JSC Coach .John 
McKay doesn’t accept that, but he says his Trojans are far stronger than they were a year ago, particularly in the defensive secondary. 

The eyes on the Rose Bowl this time will center on Grif­ fin, a junior, and D avis, a senior. They wear No. 45 and 
28, respectively. 
“ We’ ll bothh be m arked men,” admits Davis, who in­ sists he c a r r ie s no g ru d ge against Griffin as a result of the Heisman voting. 
“ It won’t be A.D. against me; it will be Southern Cal a g a in st Ohio S t a t e ,” sa y s 
Griffin. H ayes believes the game might be so close that 

 kickinging, will decide it. 
Richard Wood, the three­ time All-American linebacker at USG, adm its the Trojans will be out to stop Griffin, who gained 1,62o y ard s rushing this year. “ I'd like to see A.D. have a better game, because I was kind of sick that he didn’t get the Heisman.” said Wood. 
Davis rushed for 1,354 yards in 1974 and returned kickoffs for a 42.5 yard a v e ra g e , including a 1o2-yard sprint which opened the explosive second half in the T ro ja n s’ 
55-24 victory over Notre 
Dame. 
Close Stats 
In two Rose Bowl g am e s when they faced each other, in cluding the 42-17 USC triumph in 1973, their statis­ tics are close. Griffin carried • 
42 tim es for 244 y ard s and 
Davis 39 for 231. Griffin has averaged 5.8 yards per carry in the two m eetings, Davis 
5.9. 
A dry field a p p e a r s in prospect but the Buckeyes will be playing on g ra ss for the first tim e this seaso n whereas the T ro jan s’ home field has a natural surface. 
“ We’ve played all ll of our games on artificial turf.” said 
H ayes. “ And that is the reason we’ve worked so hard since w e’ve been out here. 
The p la y e rs think th e y ’ re running slower, and they are running slower on g ra ss.” 
At q u a rte rb a ck the 
B u ck ey es have C orn elius 
Greene, whose running and 

 passing brought him honors as the outstanding player in the 1974 R ose Bowl. USC b o asts 
P at 
B aden , who recently won a 
R hodes 
S ch o larsh ip and who has 

 recovered from an injury to the ring finger on his right hand that hampered his pass­ ing early in the season. 
Along the line, the team s' appear nearly equal._________

Ghosts o f N.D. against, not fo r9 Irish 

BY P ET ER BODO 
O f THI EXPRESS N fW S STAFP 
MIAMI, Flu. — Ghosts have long been regulars in the 
Notre Dame lineup, and this year there may be enough wraiths slithering around for 
Ara Parseghian to use them in two-platoons. 
Except, some of them will he fighting against the Irish instead of for them as the 
Orange Bowl between brawny 
No. I Alabama and decimated 
Notre Dame approaches. 
The Gipper, Knute Rockne, 
Frank Leahy will of course be there but so will memories of 
Purdue, Southern Cal, Art 
Best and an ugly, unsubstan­ tiated report of racial con­ troversy that the 
Irish vehemently deny but must live with nonetheless. 
Parseghian himself took a giant step toward ghost status by announcing his resignation effecitve Jan. 2. So spirits will be present aplenty. 
“ The only way to ap­ preciate the pressures,’’ said Parseghian, “ Is to stand in my shoes for a day or a 

The Orange Bowl game will be broadcast live on C hannel 
4, NBL TV. beginning at 7 p.m. 

 week. It has been an unusual year without question but I want to stay away from the negative aspects. Alabama is looking for a national title so we don’t have any choice but to think only of this game and prepare for it the best we can.” 
Notre Dame is as far up against the wall as a coat of paint. Almost a year ago to the day, the Irish bumped heads with 
Alabama and came away with the national title, Parseghian’s second in ll illustrious seasons. But the best measure of how radically things have changed is to remember that both were junior teams and with the rertiatch approaching Notre. 
Dame has no shot at the col­ lege crown w hile the Crimson 
Tide seems destined for it. 
What happened in between began in the summer and may not have ended yet. In­ 

 jury, suspension, injury, col­ lapse and injury have'alter­ nately eroded a team that could have been Parseghian’s finest ever. 
“ What happened to us is something coach has exper­ ienced at one time or an­ other/’ Ara claims stoicly. 

“ But few have experienced it all in in the span of one season.” 
Beginning with the summer when punter Tim Simon lost an eye in an industrial ac­ cident, continued when 9.5 sprinter E rie Penick sus­ tained an injury that 

 sidelined him until the last two games of the season. Add the loss of Al Hunter, the 9.2 sprinter, who was one of six players, who were suspended for dormitory violation. 

“ From the spring to the fall, we lost 22 players and of 

 those I ’d say about a dozen would have been starters,” 
Parseghian said. Among those was Best, who had his season shattered along with a 

 jaw in Notre Dame’s first regular season game against 
Georgia Tech. 
Best’s jaw has since recovered but the same could, 

 not necessarily be said of his morale. A superb halfback he was suspended for the late season game with Pittsburgh for missing a team meeting 

 and is at home again involun­ tarily because he showed up late for calesthentics prior to the Southern Cal game.

Forum suspended at garden 

NEW YORK — The sport of boxing was staggered when Madison Square Garden an­ nounced Tuesday it was suspending fights in the Felt Forum immediately. 
The Forum has been the site of 8o boxing shows over 
-the la st two y e a rs and has 
;becn a m a jo r d evelopin g 
•ground for fig h te r s in the 
;East, 
“ M adison Squ are Garden 
Boxing will concentrate on b rin g m a jo r bouts in the 
‘ G a r d e n 's m ain aren a on a 
•more consistent basis,” said 
^Garden 
P re sid e n t 
Mike 
•Burke said in making the an­ nouncement. 
• 
There have been 66 fights in 
The main arena since the new 
•Garden center opened in 1968. 
*Bul there were only six shows in 1973 and seven in 1974 in the main arena. None of them 

 were cham pionship figh ts. 
The last G arden title fight w as in Ju n e 1972, when 
R oberto 
D uran won the lightweight crown from Ken 
Buchanan. 
B u rk e also sa id in a statement: “ The decision was taken after careful considera­ tion and with particular con­ cern for the Garden’s trad i­ tional role in the life of the city.” t h e Garden has received adverse criticism because of the behavior of fans at Felt 
Forum fights. Bottles were thrown, property d a m a g e d and people hurt in th ree separate disturbances at the 

Forum in 1974. The last dis­ turban ce was Dec. 9 when previou sly unbeaten light heavyweight Pedro Soto, a 
Puerto Rican, was outpointed by Mike Quarry of Los An­ geles. 
After the Soto fight, Chair­ man Edwin B. Dooley of the 
New York S tate A thletic 
Commission warned that he. would not allow fights to be staged at the F orum if the crow ds could not be con­ trolled. 
But Joh n Condon, vice president, of Madison Square 
Garden Boxing, Inc., said it was not the actions of the fans but the lack of fan s that* 

 knocked out Forum boxing. 
“ T h is has nothing to do with any disturbances we’ve had in the Felt Forum in the p a s t ,” said Condon. “ I t ’s strictly a dollars and cents proposition.” 
Condon sa id that a tte n ­ dance at 37 show s in the 
4,5oo-seat F oru m this year averaged less than 1,ooo. 
There have been 127 fight cards in the Forum since 1968 with the big years being 1974 and 1973 when 43 shows were held. 
Condon also said the the 
Garden is continuing efforts to bring boxing back on home television on a regular basis.

RACINE, Wis. (AP) - For the first time in 23 years, a

It was generally agreed that s im ila r en gin es w ere no longer com petitive against higher-pow ered tu r­ bochargers. But Murphy said new rules requiring greater miles per gallon and resulting in reduction of horsepower made the engine competitive.

MELBOURNE (A P)-John 
Newcombe will get his long­ awaited chance to nibble at the bait Jimmy Connors has been casting when the two world class players meet today for the title of the Australian Ten­ nis CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
Connors, the No. I seed and defending champion, waltzed. into the final on Tuesday with a: 
6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph over Aus­ tralian Dick Crealy after New- combe, the No. 2 seed, struggled past fellow Aus­ tralian Tony Roche 6-4, 4-6, 
6-4,2-6,11-9. 
In the women’s final, defending champion Evonne 
Goolagong will meet 18-year- old Martina Navratilova of 
Czechoslovakia. 
Connors, the cocky 22-year- old American lefthander who added the United States and 
Wimbledon crowns to the Aus­ tralian title en route to becom­ ing the world’s No. I player in 
1974, said he had no trouble with Crealy, a hard-hitting server who broke strings in four of his racquets during the match. 
Newcombe, who won the 
Australian crown in 1973, took 
2 hours, 2o minutes to reach the final. The tall Australian who won nine of 2o tour­ naments he played in 1974, saved two match points in the eighth game of the final set. He then broke Roche in the ninth game, and when he held his service to even the set at 5-5, the Kooyong Stadium crowd of 
11,ooo gave him a standing ovation. 
Newcombe, considered the premier player of 1973, met 
Connors only once in 1974. in a 
World Team Tennis match, and beat him. He has been seeking a rematch, hut Con­ nors, after winning the U.S. 
Open at Forest Hills, N.Y., last 
September, said “ Get me Rod 
Laver.’’ Laver, who did not compete in the Open, accepted the challenge, with a match 

 scheduled for February. 
Newcombe was chomping at the bit. He called Connors a coward for not playing in the 
Masters in Melbourne earlier this month, hinting that a tooth ache wasn’t all that was keep­ ing him away. 
However, Connors coun­ tered by saying he was up to the test at both Wimbledon and 
Forest Hills but “ every time I get to the final, Newcombe is not there.” The Australian lost in earlier rounds of both events.

NEW YORK (AP) - Oat- fish Hunter agreed Tuesday to sign a $3 million-plus con­ tract with the New York 
Yankees, ending the most celebrated free agency in baseball history and one of the three or four most expen­ sive bidding wars American sport has known, The As­ 

 sociated Press learned. 
Official announcement of the agreem ent was to be made later in New York by the Yankees Hunter was ex­ pected to be at the news conference, his wife said in 
North Carolina. 
Although no figures could be immediately obtained, it 

 was certain that Hunter will be the highest paid performer ever to play the game, and only two or three professional basketball players qualify as 
American athletes who can boast of having a contract to rival his. 
The 
Associated 
Press learned from a high baseball.

 million bonus for Hunter, a five-year contract at $2oo,ooo per year, a 1o-year retirement plan at $5o,ooo a year, a $1- million life insurance policy for Hunter, a $25,ooo policy for each of his two children and $2oo,ooo in attorneys’ fees. 
High baseball sources said 
Tuesday night that it was a package very similar to this one which was being dis­ cussed in the final hours of negotiations Tuesday after­ noon in Ahoskie, N.C., where the contract agreement was reached between the 
Yankees, Hunter and his four attorneys. 
The unprecedented bidding war for Hunter’s services was touched off Dec. 16 when an arbitration panel announced that the Oakland right-hander was now a former Oakland right-hander—m eaning he was a free agent. 
The dispute centered around a $5o,ooo deferred payment written into 
Hunter’s 1974 baseball con­ tract, which the panel said 
Oakland owner Charles O. 
Finley had breached. Hunter was to receive $5o,ooo in straight salary and another 
$5o,ooo any way he wanted it. 
Seeking to avoid high taxes and also to provide himself an investment, Hunter asked 
Finley to deposit the second 
$5o,ooo in a deferred payment with a North Carolina in­ surance company. 
Broke Open 
Last summer, when the is­ sue broke wide open, Finley offered to pay Hunter $5o,ooo in hard cash but declined to pay the money to an in­ surance company. He said payment to the insurance company would not entitle him to a tax write-off as a business expense. 
'-'Hunter then claimed he was a free agent and Baseball 
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn said the dispute would go to arbitration. 
Peter Seitz, the impartial arbitrator on the three- m em ber panel, swung the decision Hunter’s way. Seitz and players’ union head Mar­ vin J. Miller voted for Hunter, while John Gaherin, chief negotiator for the major league baseball owners, voted to uphold Finley. 
The decison cited the 

 failure of Y inley lo pay the 
$5o,ooo in the stipulated manner for the ruling. (It) 
“ was a breach of Mr. 
H unter’s contract by the 
Oakland club and justified its term ination by Mr. Hun­ te r...The panel’s decision, therefore, upholds the sanc­ tity of contract and nothing more.” 
Baseball owns a congres­ sional exemption from the federal anti-trust laws. A reserve clause is written into every major league baseball players contract and it weds a player to one team unless he is traded. 
Moreover, baseball has not been part to the inflationary bidding wars caused by crea­ tion of a rival operation. 
Football, in 196o with the 
American Football League, caused the first inflationary spiral of players’ salaries as owners raised the ante to their players in attempt to keep them —while rival owners in the AFL tried to woo them to the new league. 
The American Basketball 
Association was created next, skyrocketing basketball salaries as players in the Na­ tional Basketball Association now had a bargaining wedge with their owners and players fresh out of college were be­ ing made instant millionaires. 
Hockey got its turn several years later with the creation of the World Hockey Associa­ tion. And football, which had figured to buck the escalating sallies with the merger of the 
National Football League and 
AFL. found itself divided into rival bidding camps once again with the birth of the 
World Football League in 
1974. 
But baseball had never been a party to bidding wars. 
Until, that is, Charley Finley didn’t read the small print in 
Latish Hunter’s contract. 
“ I don’t think anyone in the history of sport has ever been in a position of freedom to choose his employer while ruling the erest-of-perfor- mance wave that Jim Hunter is on,” said Peter Bavasi, vice president and general manager of the San Diego 
Padres, who were one of the first clubs to beat a path to 
Hunter’s door once Commis­ sioner Kuhn gave the 24 baseball clubs the green light. 

JIM “CATFISH” HUNTER 
...signed huge contract with Yanks 
Padres to get first draft pick 

NEW YORK (AP) - Being last in baseball’s standings has one redeeming vaule—being first in line for the free agent draft, and the 
San Diego Padres will get to cash in first on available talent when the winter draft opens on Jan. 9. 
The semi-annual selections, via conference calls from the 
24 major league teams to the 
New York office of Bowie 
Kuhn, commissioner of baseball, are scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m. EST. 
The California Angels will get the No. 2 pick in the regular phase, followed by the 
Chicago Cubs, Detroit, the 
New York Mets, Milwaukee, 
San Francisco, Cleveland, 
Montreal, 
Kansas 
City, 
Philadelphia and the Chicago 
White Sox. 
The Houston Astros lead the second dozen, then come 
Minnesota, St. Louis, Boston, 

Atlanta, Texas, Pittsburgh, the New York Yankees, Cin­ cinnati, Oakland, Los Angeles and Baltimore, which had the best regular-season winning percentage in the American 
League. 
Order of selection in the secondary phase of the draft was determined by a drawing of the presidents of the 
American and 
National leagues. Philadelphia was the first name drawn from the hat. followed by Detroit, the 
Cubs, Oakland, Cincinnati, 
Texas, Houston, Cleveland, the Mets, Milwaukee, St. 
Louis and California. 
In the second half of the draw are Montreal, Boston, 
Pittsburgh, Baltimore, San 
Francisco, the Yankees, San 
Diego, the White Sox, Atlanta, 
Minnesota, Los Angeles and 
Kansas City. 
Last winter, 257 players were drafted.

We introduced our 1974 model Volvos on October 15,1973. And our list prices today are the same as back then. Once we set the initial price, we didn't raise it. In spite of an 11.5% increase in the national cost-of-living index. 
Our do-nothing attitude is in marked contrast to most other car makers whoVe been retooling prices during the ’74 model year. So while our 1974 Volvo was a big value in 1973, imagine the value it is today. 
We want you to buy a 1974 Volvo. Sedan, station wagon or luxury 
164. And that’s why we've done absolutely nothing to stop you.

“ Land of the Lost.” the new science-fiction adventure ser­ ies on the NBC T elevision 
Network Saturdays at 9 a.m. adds up to one of the toughest c r e a tiv e c h a lle n g e s e v e r tackled by its producers, Sid and Marty Krofft. 
The Kroffts are accustomed to c h a lle n g e s : they have- produced such TV series as 
“ ILK. 
P u f n s t u f ,” 
“ T he 
Bugaloos,” “ Lidsville” and 
“ Sigmund and the 
Sea 
Monsters.” 
But “ Land of the Lost” is different. 
It's the story of a fam ily th a t su d d e n ly finds itself plunged into an alternate un­ iverse. This other world has been suspended in time at the p re h is to ric sta g e. It is in ­ habited by dinosaurs, flying reptiles, giant lizard people 

 and tiny monkey people. 
How to put all this on the screen w ithout reso rtin g to the usual animation — that’s the challenge. 
For the dinosaurs and their p rehistoric an im al friends, the Kroffts tu rn ed to G ene 
Warren, whose special effects won him an Academy Award for the “ Time Machine” and 
“ Tom Thum b” plus an Oscar nom inatioriTor “ The Seven

Marsha: “John, let me explain..’.’

I was only joking when I said I’d forgotten our anniversary. Actually, I simply couldn’t carry your gift home on the bus’.’

John: “You see, my arms were full and a fur coat is so bulky- • ” 
Marsha: “John, its not our anniversary. I was going to tell you that The World Almanac says today is the day of the vernal equinox!” 
John: “Marsha, did you know your nostrils flare when you say ‘equinox’?” 
Marsha: “Tell me more about the coat’.’ 
John: “Marsha, let me have The World 
Almanac. I think its time that little Herbert and 
I had a talk about the metric system’.’ 
Announcer: “Tune in next time for another episode of As The World Learns when you’ll hear Marsha say: ‘John, tell me more about the coat! Until that time, remember, you can find the answer to almost any question in the new 976-page World Almanac and Book of

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Wednesday January I 1975 

Panel winner decider 

NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE 

WASHINGTON 
- 
A 
Senate subcom m ittee dominated by 
Demo­ crats announced Tues­ d a y ^ would hold hear­ ings next week to try to determine the winner of a contested 
New 
H am pshire senatorial election. 
The three-member panel will act in response to a peti­ tion by John A. Durkin, a 
Dem ocrat, who has chal­ lenged the two-vote victory of his Republican opponent, 
Louis C. Wyman. 
The subcommittee will hear testimony from both can­ didates and from various New 
Hampshire officials, includ­ ing the state’s Ballot Law 
Commission. 
Durkin is challenging the 
Ballot Commission’s action overturning the results of a 
Nov. 27 recount that found him the winner of the Nov. 5 senatorial election by 
IO votes. 
The initial Senate recom­ mendation on seating will be made by the Rules Commit tee’s subcommittee on privi leges and elections, headed by 
Sen. Clairborne Pell, D-R.I 
The two other members are 
Robert C. Byrd of West Vir ginia, the Senate Democrat whip; and Robert T. Griffin of 
M ichigan, the 
Senate 
Republican whip. 
The full Rules Committee also dominated by 
Demo crats, would then make its recommendation to the Sen­ ate, the final arbiter on which, if either, man to seat.

Air fares affirmed 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
Civil Aeronautics Board has affirmed its earlier decision that will force the nation’s airlines to raise the air fares on short distance travel and to decrease the price of long­ distance travel. 
It also affirmed its ruling that the airlines must increase the difference in price between first-class and coach travel and lower the fares passengers pay when their trip requires flights on more than one airline. 
The board’s rejection 
Monday of the airlines’ petition for reconsideration means the fare adjustments will go into effect after 12o. days. The adjustments are not expected to have any over-( all effect on the airline in i dustry’s profits but they will mean more revenue for airlines that fly mostly short, haul routes and less revenuei for airlines that fly mostly, 
.longer distances.

Card reading is defined as drawing the correct inferences about the nature of the op­ ponent's holdings and distribution from infor­ mation disclosed by the. fall of the cards (E n ­ cyclopedia of Bridge). 
A ccurate la rd reading is liurhaps the most im portant djffiprenee between the aver­ age player and the' highly ex­ perienced one and to d a y 's challenging hand offers an excellent exam ple. It w as played by Irving Hose, one of 
England's top players. 
Since South's high c a rd s w ere co n cen trated in the m ajor suits rather than oppo­ site North’s club void, a small slam in diamonds was a good ri^k, with five diamonds vir* tru th impregnable. However. die. final contract was three nu-irum p and d eclarer had bis work cut out for him. 
West led the club ace and declarer bad his first clue.] 
Why would West lead the suit bid by declarer? Obviously. he had both length and strength in the suit. 
West shifted to a heart and declarer won his ace. Since 
W est held club length and strength, declarer correctly placed the diamond length on ins right. 
Accordingly, he led a spade kl dum m y’s queen and led a diam ond from dum m y, su c­ cessfully finessing the IO. The diamond king came next, but 
E ast complicated m atters by refusing the ace. A fter the duck, the diamonds could not be established because only the spade acc rem ained as an entry to dummy. 
D eclarer had eight tric k s and he had to find a way to get a ninth. Here’s how he did it: 
He led the club jack, which 
W est won but at the sam e tim e severed the defenders’ communications. West could not afford to cash an o th e r high club since declarer’s IO would become the ninth trick, so West exited with a heart. 
D eclarer won the h e a rt, cashed the king and ace of sp a d e s and then led a

Strict beef import quota is possible 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Beef imports w ill be held down in 1975 to below levels that could trigger stiff quotas if negotiations with foreign coun­ tries are successful, the Agriculture Depart­ ment said Tuesday. 
Pollution testing planned 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON 
- 
Testing of antipollution perform ance on au­ tom obiles selected at random from manufac­ turers’ production lines may begin soon. 
The Environm ental Protec­ tion Agency proposed Tues­ day to begin the testing. 
At present, EPA tt'sts only sam ple vehicles submitted by m anufacturers before each new model year and uses the results to approve production and sale of the entire model line represented by a test vehicle. 
The new proposal would k e e p th e p r e - te s tin g procedure, but add a program of productionline testing of random autos from selected model ines. 
To allow some margin of er­ ror in production, EPA said it would overlook the failure of up to 
IO per cent of tile productionline cars tested, in any one of the three fExleral a n ti p o llu tio n sta n d a rd s governing emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. 
If the failure rate topped IO per cen t, however, EPA would require further tests; if the failures continued, EPA said, the federal authorization to sell the effected model would be su sp en d ed until the problem is corrected. 

 lf agreem ents are worked out. USDAsaid 1975 imports — m ainly low-grade beef used for ham burger — will total 
1,15o m illio n pounds. 
U n d e rs e c re ta ry 
J. 
Phil 
C am pbell, who made the announcement, said that es­ tim ate was about 3o million pounds less than what would trigger quotas. 
In effect, the United States is telling other countries to hold down shipments of beef to 
U.S. m arkets voluntarily or be faced with tough mandatory curbs prescribed by federal law. 

The 1975 import estimate was based on the expectation that voluntary arrangements would be made with the fo re ig n su p p lie rs. 
The estim ate, although less than the maximum allowed under the quota formula, is about 85 million pounds more than entered the U.S. market in 
1974. 

Meat import restrictions, designed in a 1964 law to. p ro te c t 
Am erican cattle p r o d u c e r s , h ad b een suspended since mid-1972. The quotas were set aside at that time to encourage entry of more foreign beef to help cool off rising retail prices. 

But ^ cattle prices have slumped the past year and the government has been under pressure to reimpose quotas. 
President Ford promised in a cam paign speech last fall he e ith e r would enforce the q uotas in 
1975 or seek negotiated settlements to hold down imports. 

The announcement said beef im ports in 1974 now are ex­ pected to total 1,o65 million pounds, down about 5o million from a previous estimate and about one-fourth below 1973 im ports despite the open door policy.

Next two policemen crawled through the shattered window and into the Gomez bedroom. 
Then two more policemen clambered through the window. 
The four policemen wrestled with the first man in the corner of the bedroom. 
“ W hat’s going on here!” shouted Gomez. 
“ It just can’t be, we are having a nightm are,” said a trembling Mrs. Gomez. 

The man finally was subdued Monday night by policemen who explained afterward that the intruder had been spotted drilling holes in the roof of a food store next to the Gomez’ northwest Chicago home. 
Police said the man, who was unidentified, ran across the roof of the food store, jumped a three-foot space between it and a porch outside the Gomez bedroom, and crashed through the window onto the Gomez bed.

He was packing up at a time when, in his opinion, the country m ight be facing its greatest peril since he came 

 to W ashington. That was 32 years ago, in the m iddle of 
World W ar II, when he en ­ tered C ongress first as a m em ber of the House. 
Letting his memory wander over those years, Fulbright said he had no doubt of the country’s ability to survive that great war, but now he is 

 worrit'd about the economy, including the cost of energy. 
“ It seems to me from my reading of history that infla­ tion is one of the greatest enem ies of the dem ocratic system ,” Fulbright said. “ I think we are in a period that could undermine the stability of our system.”
