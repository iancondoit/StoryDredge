AUSTIN — Regardless of his troubles — and he has many — 
Don Yarbrough says being on the Texas Supreme Court bench is “ exhilarating.” 

“ A bsolutely fa sc in a tin g ,” Y a r­ brough said of his new job. In an ex­ clusive interview' with The Associated 
Press he said. “ I’ve never had a job which was really any more challenging to me.” 
Missing woman found dead 

By CECIL CLIFT 

The partially clad body of a wom an d iscovered near rain- swollen Cibolo Creek in North 
Bexar County was tentatively identified Saturday night as that of Linda J. Hopwood, 29, who was reported m issing W ednes­ day. 

Tile woman, dead for at least two, days at the time she was found, ap­ parently struggled with her attacker before being killed, sheriff’s investi­ gators said. 
Miss Hopwood’s parents, Mr. and 
Mrs. Buford Hopwood. 71o Sutton 
Drive, had reported her missing after she filed to re tu rn home from a 
Wednesday morning job interview. 
Her ear was found Thursday morn­ ing where she had apparently left it in the parking lot of an office building at 
1635 NE IH41o where she was to have had the interview . 
She had never showed up for the in­ terview , according to her m other. 
There w ere no signs of a struggle where the car was found. 
The only identification on the body 
Saturday was a 1965 senior class ring from John Marshall High School. 
Jewelry 

The te n ta tiv e identification was made from the ring and other jewelry. 
The victim was found face down shortly before 5 p.m. in a wooded area about 126 feet from Bulverde Road where it crosses Cibolo Creek into Co­ mal County, investigators said. 
Lt. Kenneth Bilhartz, chief of the investigative unit, said the hack of the woman’s head had what appeared to be two holes. 
But because of the body’s decom­ posing condition, he said he could not determine w hether the holes were bul­ let wounds or were the results of a blow to the skull. 
The woman’s panty hose were found in a clump of weeds about 8o feet from the road. 
Found about five feet from the body was a beige jacket with its sleeves cut off. The buttons of her blouse had been ripped off, investigators said. 
The only piece of clothing she wore was a beige skirt. The garm ent had been pulled above her thighs. 
Struggle 

“ There appeared to have been a struggle before she was killed,” Lt. 
Bilhartz said. 
“ The body bore num erous bruise m ark s. F ro m the position of the 

He faced a sim ilar challenge, he said, when he took over a bank in Vic­ toria ” 3o days from being closed by the 
EDIC.” 
“ But this thing here is .just unbelievable . . . you feel like you’re in the cockpit of a 747 airplane. To me, it pushes all of my buttons that need to be pushed. 
“ There’s a strain of patriotism as­ sociated with it, a satisfaction that comes from it of knowing that you really have done something,” he said. 

He has written only one important opinion so far, a dissent in a congres­ sional election contest that he thinks will help the loser to press his suit in the U.S. Supreme Court. But other opinions are awaiting his pen. 
Yarbrough says he commands a po­ sition from which he can contribute to the system that permitted him to rise from the obscurity and poverty of a rural Dallas County community. 
“ I didn’t have hot running water until I was a junior in high school,” he 

 said, “ and we didn’t have a commode that would flush until I was a junior in college. You talk about deprivation, we had it. 
“ W ithout the benefit of family, without the benefit of connections, without the benefit of all these things.” he created a financial empire that al­ lowed him to control $25 million in assets three years ago. 
All of that is gone now, wiped out by enough troubles to rival those of the 
Biblical Job. 

But he has had two stars to follow. At the same time one star sank with the filing of at least 16 civil suits against him, the other star rose with his vic­ tory in a race for a seat on the state’s highest court — a victory attributed by many to the similarity of Ins name to that of Don Y arborough, another 
Houston lawyer who ran unsuccessful­ ly for governor in the 19611s.

PROBE DENIED 

VERNON M CMANUS 

By JERRY DEAL 
Top San Antonio police offi­ cials denied Saturday they are investigating the possible exis­ tence of a “death squad” within the San Antonio Police Depart­ ment. 
Chief E. E. Peters and Insp. Jack 
Hutton, head of the Internal Affairs 

Division, both adamantly denied alle­ gations by a number of police officers that rank-and-file policemen have been questioned about such a squad by in­ ternal affairs officers. 
Up to 4o policemen may have been quizzed about the possibility that there have been killings and frame-ups oi crim inals and unsavory characters. 
Six of the 4o came forward to tell the 
Express-News of the probe. 
McManus caught 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HOUSTON - Vernon McMan­ us, charged with capital murder, was returned here late 
Saturday after waiving extradi­ tion following his arrest earlier in the day at J a ck so n v ille 
Beach, Fla. 

McManus, 33, of Baytown, a former football coach at San Antonio’s Mac­ 
Arthur High School, disappeared less than a day before he was to go on trial in the deaths of Baytown electrical contractor Paul Cantrell and his wife. 
Mary, last July 25. 

McManus had been free on $5o,ooo bond. 
FBI agents, Jackso nville Beach police. Baytown police and H arris 
County officers arrested McManus without resistance in a motel room. 
Police said he was in the company of a woman, and that a gun was found in his vehicle. 

After M cM anus’ d isa p p e a ra n c e , 
Texas officers said they found his bloodstained car on a deserted Harris 
County road. At the time, Sheriff Jack 
Heard said he did not rule out foul play, “but taking a powder is always a possibility.” 

Paula Cantrell Derese, 26, daughter of the slain couple, pleaded guilty in the case and is awaiting sentencing. 
Prosecutors allege she and McMan­ us arranged for the Cantrell couple to he killed for their insurance money. 

McManus was to have appeared for the trial last week. Jury selection in the case took more than six weeks, and 
State D istrict Court J u d g e LD. 
McMaster had overruled a motion for a change of venue. 

McManus is a former football player and assistant coach at Lamar Univer­ sity in Beaumont, Tex. 
Houston authorities shave been 

 tight-lipped about the arrest operation because of a gag order issued by the court. 
They said a news ban on information must rem ain in effect because 

 evidence of the flight to avoid pro­ secution charge is admissible in the capital murder trial, which has been scheduled to resume May 9 in McMas- ter’s court. 

Each of the six said he was asked ii he had been involved or knew of any other officers who were involved in killings or frame-ups. 
Not all officers contacted by the Ex­ press-News knew of the inquiry. Some policemen had heard of the probe hut had not been quizzed by internal af­ fairs. Others said they hadn’t heard anything and called the idea of such a squad impossible. 
‘Blown away’ 

One of the six who cam e forward recalled, “ I was asked if I knew an­ ything about any low-type dope dealers who had been blown away (killed).” 
Said another of the six: “ What they fear is this death squad is taking the law, vigilante style, into its own hands and maybe even executing criminals, just like some of those movies in re­ 

 cent years. 
“They are afraid these guys on the r squad figure they’re .just killing peck- I erwoods,” the policeman said. 
Chief Peters denied there was any I such investigation and said it sounded K like a possible spinoff of the internal I probe begun when two police officers rn were recently accused of planting I drugs on an East Side drug pusher. 
Insp. Hutton was more vehement in | his denials. Referring to the six p a -1 beemen who told of the inquiry, Hutton & said: “Those officers must have been S smoking m arijuana. This is rid ic u - 1 
Ions.” 
One of the six officers said his bosses I hoped to keep the inquiry under wraps. I

STAFF PHOTO BY PAT HAMILTON 

NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - More than a year before he resigned the pre­ sidency in disgrace, Richard M. 
Nixon was so preoccupied with the Watergate matter and aware of the risk of his impeachment that he spent days on end trying to extricate himself from the scandal. 

“ We kept one jum p ahead of the 
(expletive) sheriff,” he complained to 
H. R. Haldeman, then the White House chief of staff, in late April of 1973. some 16 months before Nixon ahdicat ed the Presidency. 
Tilt; disclosure of the former Presi­ dent’s intense involvement in the Wa­ tergate cover-up, beginning as early as th re e days after the Ju ne 17, 1972 burglary at the Democratic P arty ’s national headquarters, emerged Sa­ turday in a series of White House tape transcripts never before made public. 
The transcripts obtained Saturday showed that Nixon was intimately fa­ miliar w'ith each stage of the unsuc­ cessful attempt to contain the spread of the Watergate taint from reaching, ultimately, into the Oval Office. 
T hree days after the W atergate burglary, Nixon told Charles W. Col­ son, his former special counsel, that he was involved in a “dangerous job” as they discussed the possibility that fe­ deral investigators would be satisfied to place the blame on the seven defen­ dants arrested the night of the break­ in. 
Nixon used the word “ stonewall,” which later would become a catchword

San Antonio fire fighters and policemen no longer are eligible to receive unlimited sick pay upon retiring. 

And a long-time opponent of the un­ limited sick pay said Saturday he was glad to see Gov. Dolph Briscoe sign the repeal of the legislation. 

“ I am glad to see a sensible ap­ proach has been finalized,” said City 
Councilman Phil Pyndus. 

Pyndus noted he had received “ a lot of political opposition” because he op­ posed the unlimited sick pay from the beginning. 
“ In 1975, I asked the governor not to sign the bill creating the unlimited kick pay, so needless to say I’m glad it’s repealed,” he said. 

Gov. Briscoe signed the repeal Fri­ day, which had previously passed both houses of the legislature under a bill sponsored by State Sen. Frank Lom- bardino. 

Spokesmen for the policemen and the fire fighters had earlier said they would express no reaction to the repeal legislation because a majority of citi­ zens favored the repeal. 
Councilman Henry Cisneros said, 
“ This clears the air of the controversy. 
With a clean slate, we can now proceed for a sick pay provision for all city employes.” 
Firemen and policemen still are eli­ gible to collect pay for a maximum of 
9o days accumulated sick leave upon retiring.

Daredevil Adair loves his work 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HOUSTON - Paul N. “ Red” Adair says he got into the business of cap­ ping wild oil wells nearly 4o years ago because he “ was hungry.” 

The 62-year-old g ran d fath er, now a living leg en d in w o rld oil c ir c le s , is no lo n g e r hungry and doesn’t need the m oney. So why does he continue to take ch an ces of b ein g crushed, blown up. burned and broken? 
‘You've got to love your w o rk ,” he says.

Over 1,ooo 
Adair has clam ped control valves on m ore than a 1.oo1) wild wells since he started in the business in 1938. And when a well blows out anywhere, threatening lives and m illions of dollars worth of equipm ent, the ow ners usually send for " R e d .” And he* or one or m ore of his staff w ill com e running. 

He still g ets kicks out of oil field e m e r ­ gencies. 
"No two jobs are alike," he said. "T h e re are a million little tricks to it. And I g uess some of it is instinct." 
Adair has worked on som e m o n stro u s con­ flagrations. 
He recalls a well nam ed GT2 in the S ahara that blew out in 1962 and form ed a torch that was visible to John Glenn, A m e ric a 's first man to orbit the earth, as he passed over IOU miles up. 
He also re m e m b e rs an offshore well in the 
Persian Gulf that threatened to wipe out $3o m illion in e q u ip m e n t and s p r a y e d 1o.ooo barrels of crude into the sea each day before it was recapped. 
“ They had an oil slick 8oo m ile s w id e," 
Adair said. 
Do the wives of the “ H ellfighters” worry when their men are som ew h ere like in the 
North Sea fighting a blowout? 
Virginia Hansen says no. 
“He’s been at it a long tim e ,” M rs. Hansen says of her husband. Boots. 
"H e knows what h e ’s doing. H e 's never been hurt. So. I don't worry about it really." 
And Mrs. Hansen has long since m ad e her peace with the e rra tic and freq u e n tly h a r ­ rowing lifestyle shap ed by h e r h u s b a n d 's profession.

An official of the N orw egian govern­ m ent environm ental agency said dead b ird s had been sighted in the urea but. that the slick ’s effect “ will be su rp ris e ingly s m a ll.”

T he spillage exceeded the 7.6 million gallons that flowed into the North At­ lantic off 
M assachusetts from the grounded su p e rtan k e r Argo M erchant last D ecem ber. The w orst tan k er spill on record was 29 million gallons from the Torrey Canyon, w recked off south­ eastern E ngland in 1967. 
“ I think we would have been in real^ trouble if we h a d n ’t succeeded today."a 
Charles Lane, a Phillips official, told if reporter. 
If the A dair team had failed to seal off the well, the alternative would have b e e n to d ig a n o th e r w ell to d iv e r t p re s su re from the run aw ay Bravo 14 well. This would have taken m ore than-- a m onth to accom plish. 
N orw egian P r im e M in iste r N ordli;, sent a teleg ram here after S atu rday’s success saying he was “ happy and re­ lieved.” 
But the consequences of the blowout on the infant North Sea oil industry, the cost to Phillips, and the cause of the accident rem ained unknown.

Bonding didn’t slow them much 

Free and easy bonding prac­ tices in Bexar County may need a close study because the way it’s going now, nobody is safe. 
I have already told how Harry and Dolly 
Howe closed out their mama-papa grocery store at 2321 Blanco Road after a terrifying experience there a week ago last Friday night. 
Two armed tough guys entered the store just before closing time, shoved the couple 

 into a back room, bound them securely and then waved the store’s butcher knife in their faces until told where $2,3oo in savings was stashed. 
Arrested on the basis of photos, two su­ spects were identified next day by Mr. and 
Mrs. Howe, both Bt). 
Acting Night Magistrate Quon Lew set bond at SKM),OOO each on the two, one in his twenties and the other in his late teens. 

It developed that the two suspects, who police say have long criminal records, were 

 out on bond for other recent local armed robberies when the Howe Food Market was hit. 
“ That’s when we made up our minds to sell everything and quit,” said Harry Howe. “ For all I knew, the same goons who'd already been turned loose after a similar heist might be back out there next week terrorizing us again.” 
The Howes nad been in business on Blanco for 38 consecutive years. 
And as events proved, there was more truth than poetry in Harry’s dark speculations 

 about a second visit from the same bandits. 
For Peace Justice Rudy Esquivel this past 
Wednesday reduced bond on the younger su­ spect from $1oo,ooo to $25,ooo, and within a matter of hours, he made bond and was back on the streets. 
It is even possible the young fellow paid his bondsman with cash taken from the elderly couple since no loot has been recovered. 
Prior to the April 22 Howe robbery, the younger suspect was out on $15,ooo bond which had been reduced from $5o,ooo, also by order of Peace Justice Esquivel. 

The $15,o11o bond was in connection with another stickup here in February. 
Meanwhile the older suspect, free on $1o,ooo bond in another “ aggravated robbery with firearms” case when he allegedly accompan­ ied his young friend to the Howe store, re­ mains in Bexar County J aul under the 
$1oo,ooo bond set by Night Magistrate Lew. 
NOTE: Hist. Judge .lames E. Barlow, ad­ vised Thursday of how the twice-bonded younger suspect was back in circulation, reset the man’s bond at $1oo,ooo and ordered him picked up at once. f Aperitif9 spells victory in bee 

By LYNN LAIR 
Steve Greer, a 13-year-old student from Episcopal Middle 
School, correctly spelled “ aper­ itif” to become winner of The 
News’ 1977 Spelling Bee Satur­ day. 
The eighth grader, son of Dr. and 
Mrs. George T. Greer. 915 Mt. Ramer, will travel to Washington, D.C., for competition in the National Spelling 
Bee finals June 6-1o. 
The News, sponsor of the 24th annual event, will pay all expenses of Steve’s trip to the capital city, where he will spend five days sightseeing as well as spelling for more prizes. 
Stereo 
The youngster’s first place efforts also won him a Zenith stereo system, provided by Joe Thiele Co., local Zen­ ith distributor. 
Steve was especially thrilled with the stereo prize. 
" I ’ve been wanting one for a long time,” the youngster said happily. 
Of the trip to Washington, the champion speller predicted. “ It should be very exciting. I ve never been there.” 
Steve said he had been “ studying for quite a while" for the contest. He also was a spelling bee contestant the past two years. 
Finishing second among the It) con­ test finalists was Carla Ludwig, 14, from St. Luke’s Catholic School. 
Carla, who was eliminated on the word “ bowsprit,” won a 3o-volume set of Encyclopedia Britannica for her ef­ forts. 
Cory Cofield, a seventh grader from 
Nimitz Middle School, won a Webster’s 
New Collegiate Dictionary and Web­ ster’s Thesaurus as third place prize. 
Cofield left the contest after mis­ spelling “ mufti.” 
Fourth place winner was Russell 
Shaddox, 14, representing Eisenhower 
Middle School. “ Amercing” proved his undoing in the contest.

A day before it officially as­ sumes office on Sunday, San 
Antonio’s new 11-member city council was launched—and immediately ran aground. 
But debate, compromise and apology soon had the city’s ship of state afloat and heading for remodeled quarters at 
City Hall. 
Among issues covered during Satur­ day’s informal discussion and briefing session were council’s regular Thurs­ day meeting schedule, staff-hiring po­ licy, expansion of council office and chamber and an apology by City Mgr. 
Tom Huebner. 
Meeting time 
Following an hour of debate, the IO district councilmen and Mayor Lila 
Cockrell agreed on an 8 a.m. Thursday meeting time with a one-hour lunch break to start at noon. 
The schedule resumes with a one- hour “ citizens to be heard” session beginning at I p.m. followed by coun­ cil’s regular “ B ” session starting at 2 p.m. 
The expansion of council chambers and office space, as well as public scaling facilities, will affect at least one other city department. 
Under plans agreed on Saturday, council chambers will be expanded to accommodate the IO councilmen, the mayor and the city manager at the meeting table. 
Seating space for citizens will be enlarged from 84 to 169 by removal of the chamber’s west wall and expansion into present council office space. 
Council office space will be moved to the second floor—displacing Stewart

Violence for sale 

‘Violent World* can get your attention 

It can also m ake you sick 

Staff Photo* by Charles Barksdale 

By CARLOS FERNANDEZ 

A ghoulish magazine spe­ cializing in brutal violence has hit San Antonio new- stands. 

Its publisher, Jules Warshaw, expects to be selling a million copies a month within a year. 
The first issue of “ Violent World” has three pictures on its cover which give only a mild glimpse of what awaits the reader inside. 
The cover picture of a man falling is headlined “ I Killed My Wife.” 
The inside story includes a picture of what happened when the falling man landed on a spiked fence. 
Another cover picture shows the mutilated and bloody body of a child and is headlined “ 2ooo Babies Bru­ tally Murdered Every Year by 
Mommy and Daddy.” 
Warshaw told a syndicated co­ lumnist that Violent World “ is edited for the mature adult inter­ ested in an unrestricted look at the violent side of contemporary life. 

The lot 

“ Its content is devoted to every aspect of violent world — war, ter­ rorism, crime and criminality, aberrant behavior, rioting, cruelty, torture and disasters.” 
The monthly has already been distributed to news dealers not only in the United States but also in 
Canada and Europe. 
It had an original print order of 
3oo,ooo. 
Everything and anything goes with the magazine. Even stories that are years old are rehashed and written without indicating when the story took place. 
One picture includes a crowd of nine and asks “ Can you spot the murderer?” The answer turns out to be a 12-year-old youth. 
A story titled “ Rioting Youths Go 
On a Savage Kill Spree” pictures a student in Bangkok hanging by the neck while another man bangs him over the head with a chair. 

Even automobiles are victimized. 
. One story tells of “ Auto Makers 
Big Secret! — Your Car is a Rolling 

Coffin.” Another story shows pic­ tures of dead bodies slumped over posts after being tortured. The story includes a picture of a man in agony with what appears to be a torn-off arm. 
“ I ’ve been thinking about putting this magazine out for a number of years,” Warshaw said. 
“ This world we live in is in a never-ending situation of all forms of violence — the whole spectrum of violence, tragedy and horror. My magazine is bringing a1! of it under one roof. 

Showing it 

“ We want to show the enormous amount of violence that goes on day-to-day throughout the world. 
“ The inhumanity,of people, the terrorism, the murder, the rape...” 

Cannibalism is treated under three different stories — one in­ cluding pictures of a man in his kitchen with the headline “ You Are 
Looking at a Man Who Eats Chil­ dren.” 
There’s even a story of “ A Mo­ dern Day Jack the Ripper” who 
“ commits horrible murders for the sake of morality.” 
Warshaw said there are no res­ trictions on the type of photographs published. 
"Right now I ’m looking at some photographs of the aftermath of a terrible airplane crash,” he said. 

His instinct 

“ Terrible pictures of the victims. 
My instinct is to run the pictures.” 
According to Warshaw the maga­ zine will be available to children. 
The magazine’s editor, Jesse 
Leaf, said “ Our readers are not in­ terested in politics. We just show them pictures of people getting bashed on the head. 
Publisher Warshaw has no mis­ givings about th$ magazine. “ I think that people want to see and read about these kinds of things. 
“ If they don’t, then the magazine will fail, lf they do. it will succeed. 
“ And I tell you very frankly, I expect an enormous audience,” he said.

During the two-month expansion and remodeling period, Mayor Cockrell advised councilmen to share office space. 
District 6 Councilman Rudy Ortiz said he didn’t like the idea of sharing office space at City Hall and would set up shop at his residence until tin* work is completed. 
At one point, City Mgr. Huebner apologized to Ortiz for leaving (Ortiz ) 
District 6 off of Friday’s bus tour of the 
Sheriff in ja il himself 

REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) - San 
Francisco Sheriff Richard Hongisto is spending his first weekend as a jail­ bird, doing five days’ penance behind bars for contempt of court. 
“ He’s doing what everybody else is doing in jail, reading or watching TV,” said an officer at the San Mateo County 
Jail. 
Hongisto surrendered Friday to start his sentence on his contempt convic­ tion for failing to evict elderly tenants from a low income Chinatown hotel. 
The 39-year-old sheriff is doing his time away from the other inmates because he is a civil prisoner, accord­ ing to Sheriff’s Capt. Grant Davis. 
“ The state law requires that since he is a civil prisoner, he be kept se­ gregated from criminal prisoners,” he said. “ There are no other civil pri­ soners." 
Upon entering the lockup 3o miles south of San Francisco, Hongisto said he expected his stay to he “ a very en­ lightening and rewarding experience 
... to understand what you’re doing to people you really should go through it yourself.” 
Jail officials said iii a news release 
Hongisto would be treated “ no differ­ ently than any other inmate.” 
Davis said Hongisto had made no special requests of any kind. Hongisto surrendered after deciding not to pur­ sue further appeals on his contempt conviction handed down in January. 
He argued that he did not have the manpower to make wholesale evictions at the International Hotel without bloodshed. 
Accompanied by his attorney and wearing a gray, pinstriped, three-piece suit, Hongisto was given a pat-down search by a deputy and taken for booking to an area out of view of pho­ tographers. He later was issued stan­ dard prison garb — an orange jump­ suit. 
Pigeon ferry to replace taxicabs 

MANCHESTER g u a rd ia n SERVICE 
J 
LONDON — Pigeons will replace taxicabs in Plymouth, England to ferry urgent medical specimens from hospi­ tals to the central laboratory. 
Cost is the main reason. It now costs 
$42,75o a year for the 2o hospitals that use the taxi service. It will cost only 
$85 a year for pigeon care. 
If trials to be arranged next week are successful, a dozen pair of pigeons soon will be fluttering across rooftops with tiny unbreakable vials of blood, and possibly urine, strapped to their bellies. 

 city. The tour was held to acquaint the new council with San Antonio. 
Huebner later said he will announce on Thursday plans for reorganizing the system of handling constituent com­ plaints as well as a proposal for in­ creasing city staff assigned lo council­ men. 
Ortiz and District 5 Councilman 
Bernardo Eureste voiced objection to present City Charter guidelines which make city staff responsible only to the city manager. 
Both mon said they want council aides directly responsible to council­ men. 
Mayor Cockrell explained to the freshmen councilmen that under the 
City Charter, all city staffers can bi* responsible only to the city manager. 
District 7 Councilman Joe Alderete said he wants all council aides to be bilingual. Phil Pyndus, Districts, said he does not believe the ability to speak both English and Spanish should be a requirement in the hiring of council staff.

WASHINGTON' - Se­ cretary of State Cyrus 
Vance, in a m ajor ad ­ dress, called Saturday for a “ rea listic" U.S. stand on human rights abroad in keeping with 
"the limits of our power and of our wisdom." 
Vance's first prepared speech as secretary of state, delivered to a Law 
Day observance at the 
University of Georgia, took a cautious position on the use of leverage to i m p l e m e n t 
A m erican ideals in countries. 
While e m p h a ­ sizing the U.S. com mitment to a broad range of h u m a n rig h ts, he said that "a sure formula for d efeat of our goals would be a rigid, hubristic attempt to impose our values on o th e rs. A d o ctrinaire plan of action would be as d a m a g i n g as in differ­ ence." 
Case-by-case

But we also know that this right can be violated by a government's action or inaction — for exam-

 dom of thought; of religion; of assembly; free­ dom of speech, freedom of the press; freedom of m ovem ent 
_ —mmmm both within and o u tsid e o n e’s own country; freedom to take part in government." 
Vance reaffirmed that the United States looks to the use of economic aid 
— both bilateral and th r o u g h international financial institutions — as a mechanism for fos­ tering human rights. 
Aid reductions 
He also noted that the 
C a r t e r a d m in is t ra tio n reduced military aid to three countries earlier this year due to human rights abuse. 
E th io p ia, one of the countries that the United 
S tates cut, has since denounced the action, closed five U.S. installa­ tions and ejected most 
A m e r i c a n s from the country. Argentina and 
Uruguay, the other two countries singled out for m ilitary aid cuts, said they would take no future m i l i t a r y aid from the 
United States because of the strings attached. 

The President is reported to he p l a n n i n g an a d ­ dress o f his own on the s a m e su b ject in a f e w w eeks 

 lems, the prospects for effective action and the official "perspective" in view of U.S. security in­ t e r e s t s and past p r a c ­ tices. 
The a d d r e s s , which was said to reflect State 
D e p a r t m e n t policy p a p e r s as well as personal deliberation of by Vance, was notably more cautious than many human rights statements by President Carter. 
The P r e s i d e n t is r e ­ ported to be planning an address of his own on the sam e subject at a com­ m e n c e m e n t a d d r e s s a few weeks from now, and there is informed specu­ lation that he will take a stronger line. 
Reacting to criticism that the United States has not m a d e clear the hu­ m an r i g h t s it seeks to advance. Vance for the first time gave an expli­ cit definition. What the 
United States means by human rights, he said, is:

San Antonio EXPRESS N E W S — Sunday M ay I 1977 
Says Yarbrough: I defied the establishment 

Continued from Page JA 

 claimed Yarbrough defrauded them irT a bank deal. Yarbrough has appealed their $116,4o6 judgment. 
It wasn't really fraud, he contends. 
Damages 
“ In order to have fraud, you’ve got to have five or six different elements. 
You have to have specifically four. 
JVow the jury found three of those ele­ ments, but they did not find the fourth element.” he said. 
What was the fourth element? 
“ That’s the element of damages.” he said. 
“ But in candor, I have to report to you that the jury did not accept my version of the facts,” he added. 
A state bar grievance committee in 
Houston has filed suit to disbar Yar­ brough, alleging more than 5o viola­ tions of the Code of Ethics. 
But these really are all part of “ five or six” broad allegations, he said. 
“ It s kinda like saying. ‘This man went down and was involved in an au­ tomobile accident.’ Okay, that’s one broad area. But then they say, He was involved in an automobile accident in a red car.’ That's one count. lie s in­ 

 volved in an automobile accident in a red car on Jan. IO.’ That’s two. Now he’s already got two. That’s what they’ve done,” he said. 
“ There is not one thing that the State 
Bar has alleged today with regard to areas of my alleged misdoing that if I had the responsibility to do it again today I would not do exactly as I did it previously. 
“ And furthermore, that I would not invite 5oo witnesses to come down and watch us on the shoreline and as we proceeded exactly in that manner,” he said. 
Depositions 
The grievance committee has asked to take 23 depositions “ all over the country,” Yarbrough said. In all. the committee probably will spend 
$15o,ooo, he said. 
“ If you were to give me $5o,ooo cash on my desk today, and a fulltime se­ cretary and a fulltime investigator that had some relative ability — maybe he could have personality defects, as I think probably some of theirs over there might well have, in the sense that they could not go elsewhere and make a living practicing law — you 

 give me one fulltime investigator and a fulltime secretary and $5o,ooo and the power of subpoena, and I would be able to disbar any IO lawyers in Texas, of your choosing, or anybody else’s choosing. 
“ Put Leon Jaworski at the top of the list, if you want to,” he said. 
Jaworski has called Yarbrough unfit to serve on the high court. 
“ And furthermore, you could disbar 

 any doctor, or any architect or any engineer or any pharmacist,” he said. 
Why? 
“ The law and our society have be­ come so complex that it is virtually impossible to matriculate in business or in a professional capacity anymore, without offending somebody’s guide­ lines, even though it may be perfectly innocent on your part,” he said. 
Of the possible targets, why did the 
Kay th at again 

Like the Bible he is so fond of citing, Don Yarbrough frequently uses parables to get the message across. In asserting that he hadn't really defrauded business asso­ ciates Rex Cooper and Douglas 
Ford, here is how Yarbrough ex­ plained the situation: 

“ If I say to you it’s not raining outside — oh no, I say it IS raining outside, and as a result of all that — 
I know perfectly well that it is not raining outside — but you go over 

 there and get your hat and coat and so on and so forth, and then you go outside and lo and behold you find that it is not raining outside. Well, you haven’t been damaged.” 

But in this example didn’t he de­ liberately mislead the person he told it was raining? 

“ No, I did not,” he said, forget­ ting in less than a minute that he knew “ perfectly well that it is not raining outside.” 

 bar single him out? 
“ You've got to understand that this is the first time in history, in modern history, that someone has had the gall 
— as has been described in the press — and the effrontery to become a candi­ date for the Supreme Court without the anointment of the powers that be.” he said. 
A candidate is supposed to go to the major law firms of the state and get the laying on of the hands of all the top lawyers, he said. He did not do that. 
“ I didn’t know I was supposed to.do that. It was simply a matter of ignor­ ance on my part. I wouldn't have done it anyway,” he said. 
They are making an example of him, he said, to send out this message: “ By golly, don’t anybody ever do this again, because this is what we’ll do to you, and can do to you. You may or may not have the stamina of Don Yarbrough .” 
Even if the bar succeeds, Yarbrough intends to stay on the bench. The Texas 
Constitution does not say judges on the high court must be lawyers. 
“ I have made this determination: that I have been put in this office as a consequence of the power of the peo­ ple. They put me here, and the people 

 are the ones that are going to take me out of this place,” he said. 
He will not be up for election until 
1982. 
Meanwhile, “ I’ve got 2o per cent of a!! the power in Texas, judicially,” he said, referring to the five judges it takes to make a majority. 
“ I wouldn’t want any more power than I ’ve got. That’s all I want. Be­ cause you invest too much power in any individual, and it ruins that indi­ vidual, and that individual loses his capacity for the vision to see where we want to go . . . If I didn’t have this disbarment thing, this would be the greatest life I could ever design for myself,” he said. 
His wife and three children still are in Houston because he must preserve the homestead status of his house, he said. But that soon will change, and he will be able to sell the house and move the family to Austin. 
They will have to rent, however, and use nearly all of their money for at­ torneys’ fees. 
Because of his religious faith, he is optimistic for the future, he said. 
Last year, he announced that God

They don’t want that. 

“ This really makes it look bad, coming right at a time the other in­ vestigation concerning policemen is still on,” the policeman said. 

• “ I think we need some outside in­ vestigation, there are some strange things going on at the PI).” said an­ other officer.

The Express-News was told the death squad probe was already under way when the two officers were ac­ cused of planting drugs on the pusher. 

The two policemen resigned after one reportedly admitted verbally to planting heroin on the man. 

The U.S. Justice Department is in­ vestigating that case to determine it there were any criminal violations of civil rights, according to Justice De­ partment spokesman John Wilson.

Also, Bexar County Dist. Atty. Bill 
White said he will submit the alleged planting case to the county grand jury. 
One veteran police sergeant, when asked to comment on the death squad suspicions, said, “ Ifs news to me, I haven’t even heard any rumors. 

“ There s been all kinds of rumors flying about the auto theft ring probe. but I just can’t hardly believe this other thing.” 
Assistant Bexar County Dist. Atty. 
John Quinlan III said he had heard nothing about a possible death squad investigation and had his doubts about there being any such squad.__________

The lieutenant said recent rains confounded the investigation by wash­ ing away possible clues, “ lf it had rained any harder, she might have floated down the river,” he said. 
The body was only seven feet from the creek, its waters already over the 
Bulverde Road bridge. 
Bilhartz said he could not determine if the bra was used to strangle the wo­ man. “ It was either tied or wrapped around her neck, we haven’t been able to determine which,” he said. 
He estimated the woman had been dead for one or two days. “ She was possibly raped or was the victim of an attempted rape,” he said. 

Rings 

In addition to the class ring, the wo­ man wore two gold rings, one of which had a large stone. Neither of the rings was a wedding band. 
She also had a gold Timex watch on her right arm. Bilhartz said the wo­ man appeared to be about 5*5 or 5-8 and

 weighed about 13o pounds. Her hair was described as reddish brown of un­ determined length. 
Investigators spent some four hours at the scene searching for clues iii the 

 killing. 
Miss Hopwood hail suffered brain damage in a 1M88 auto wreck, accord­ ing to her parents, and had been on medication at the time of her disap­ pearance. 
“ She was very excited at the pro­ spect of becoming a secretary or clerk,” her mother said before Satur­ day’s discovery. “ It was the culmina­ tion of her recent SAC business courses and I can’t imagine her not following through. 
“ She is tlu1 type of person that if she is going to be 3o minutes late she would have called,” said Mrs, Hopwood.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday May I 1977 
Vietnam m arks anniversary 

TOKYO 
(AIO—Viet­ nam celebrated the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon to Commu­ nist-led forces with a round of rallies and fes­ tivities Saturday praising 
Viets 

 w o n ’ t sell arms 

N E W Y O R K TIMES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - The 
Vietnamese government has quietly turned down requests from several 
A frica n and Asian na­ tions to buy Am erican weapons that were left after the collapse of the 
South V ietnam ese go­ vernment two years ago. according to State De­ partment and Pentagon sources. 
The Vietnamese have also declined to supply guerrilla movements in 
Thailand. Malaysia and 
The P h ilip p in e s, the sources said. 
V ietnam ’s refusal to se ll part of its huge stockpile of Am erican weapons — many of them no doubt in poor condi­ tion — is attributed, in part at least, to a desire to cement economic links with Western nations, in­ clu d in g the 
U nited 
States, and to reluctance to being labeled as an

N E W Y O R K TIMES SERVICE 
W A SH IN G TO N - A top government food aid official, in one of his last actions before resigning in April, recommended suspension of the country’s largest rice ex­ porter from doing busi­ ness under the Food for 
Peace Program. 
In a confidential me­ m orandum , a copy of which was obtained by 
The New Y o rk Tim es 
Service, he said an in­ vestigative report had shown that Grover Con­ nell, who heads the Con­ nell Rice and Sugar Co. of Westfield, N.J., had owned a secret interest in a shipping agency that represents foreign go­ vernments receiving the aid. 
The recom m endation was made by W. Glenn 
Tussey, who, as the 
A g ric u ltu re 
D e p art­ m ent’s assistant sales m anager, headed the 
Food for 
Peace, or 
PL48o, program. 
Tussey charged the re­ ported relation ship in ­ volving Connell violated reg u la tio ns and gave 
Connell Rice and Sugar an unfair advantage over competitors. 
Connell shipped 72 per cent of all rice moved under the PL48o program in the 1976 fiscal year, according to Tussey, who recently left the depart­ ment to join the staff of the Senate A g ricu ltu re 
Committee.

The o ffic ia l Vietnam 
News Agency, describing the celebration as “ Viet­ nam’s Victory Day,” said the anniversary was be- ing marked in conjunc- 

 tionwith May Day. 
Hanoi’s 
Ba 
Dinh 
Square was the scene of a huge ra lly attended by thousands of Vietnamese and foreign delegations who heard speeches from the c p u ntry’s top leader- 

 ship, VN A said. The speeches repeat e d Iv stressed reconstruction of the war-torn country. 
The news agency, m onitored here, de­ scribed a “ festive mood” in the country. It said 

 sports activities and cul­ tural shows were staged in major cities, including 
Saigon, now renamed Ho 
Chi Minh City. 
The main speaker was 
Hoang Quoe V ie t, the chairman of the V ietnam 

Federation of Trade 
Unions, who described the past two years as “ a new and very tense struggle of the working class and laboring people to heal the wounds of war and create revolutionary

TICKLED 
S3 ANO $4 
W ASHINGTON (A P) — President Carter and top administration officials “ made considerable pro­ gress” Saturday as they approached a self-imposed deadline for presenting welfare reform proposals, a spokesman said. 
The President spent three hours in the Cabinet 
Room with Vice President W alter F. Mondale; 
Charles Schult/e. chairman of the Council of Econ­ omic Advisers, and Joseph Califano. secretary of the 
Departm ent of Health. Education and W elfare working on the administration pla to be announced 
Monday. 
Deputy White House Press Secretary Rex Granum said Monday’s announcement, one day after the May 
I deadline Carter had set earlier, would deal w ith the general principles of welfare reform. Legislation to carry out the actual revision will come sometime later. 
Granum said some questions remained to be ans­ wered. He said the announcement Monday would outline what Carter hopes to do in the over-all wel­ fare area. 
He said the goal was to make the welfare system 
“more efficient and equitable.” 
One of the key problems is finding a way to make welfare equitable forthose unable to work but at the same time encouraging recipients to work if they are able to do so. 
Carter, dressed informally in a gold velour shirt, said at the start of the meeting that he wanted to talk to (he officials “about how much we’re ready to go with.” 
In addition to Califano. Labor Secretary Ray 
Marshall and Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland attended; along with their top assistants and repre­ sentatives of the White House Dom estic Council, 
Office of Management and Budget and top Carter and Mondale aides, including Ham ilton Jordan, speechwriter Jim Fallows and Gail Harrison, one of 
Mondale’s top policy advisers. 
While the President was in the meeting, the White 
House announced that he had declared Tennessee a major disaster area, as a result of severe storms and flooding there in early April, and had declared an emergency in Oregon because of the impact of the long Western drought. 
The actions, taken Friday, make special federal aid in the form of unemployment payments, other funds and loans at low interest rates available to the victims. 
Carter and Califano are reportedly determined to eliminate from welfare regulations discrimination against poor families where two parents are living together. Such discrim ination in some states en­ courages the breakup of families.

Proposed cut in day care funds criticized 

By 
DAVID MCLEMORE 
Children w ill be the losers if there is a cut in state funds for day care centers, a Texas Depart­ ment of Public Welfare worker said Saturday. 
The proposed reduc­ tion of funds would bring an increase in unlicensed c are facilities, according to Ann Butler, director of 
DPW Child Development 
Programs. 
“ There is always a problem with unlicensed arid unqualified child care,” she said. “ But it wild increase if state- supported centers are 

 crippled by decreased funding.” 
Mrs. Butler was a par­ ticipant in the day care management workshop at the East Side Multi- 
Service Center, 28o5 FC 
Commerce St. The meet­ ing was sponsored by 
DPW and the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
The controversy over day care funding stems from budget cuts of $2 million from the state al­ lotment to federally sub­ sidized day care centers. 
The cuts were proposed 
. last week by the Texas 
Senate.

 the cuts will force a drop of 4,ooo children from centers statewide, in ­ cluding about 2oo in San 
Antonio programs. 
“ These centers provide competent, qualified care for the children of low-income fam ilies,” 
Mrs. Butler said. “ These are mainly women who are tryin g to stay off welfare and improve their lives. 
‘ i f we have to drop their children out of the programs, they will have to find some place to keep th e ir children. 
Since most can’t afford com m ercial care centers, they would be forced to leave them with unqualified people. 
" I t’s that or leave them home alone. 
It would he a terrible choice.” 
Mrs. Butler said the unlicensed and unquali­ fied provider of child care poses a serious po­ tential harm to the phy­ sical and emotional well-being of the child. 
‘ ‘ People think it re­ quires no skills to care for children,” she said. 
“ But the first six years of a child's life sets per­ il! a n e n t devcIoprnen t patterns. 
“ So much damage to the child’s self-concepts and sense of being can be done if they are not pro­ perly cared for. 
“ These mothers may want to stay home with their children, but they can’t. They have to work. 
They need some place good and qualified to leave their children.” 

Florida oil spill breaking 

M IAM I 
(AP) - A 
8o-mile-long smear of oil which floated dangerous­ ly close to the popular tourist beaches of the 
Florida Keys and the continent's only living coral reef began break­ ing up Saturday, s till safely at sea, Coast 
Guard officials said. 

But clean-up crews were kept nearby in case remnants of the brown stain began washing on­ shore, and Coast Guard vessels and airplanes launched a search for the tanker responsible for the polluting mess.

“ F’ or all the good things G.J. did, he was gratified twice by you people who gave him the opportunity to serve you,” said Judge Oliver 
Sutton of the Slew York 
Supreme Court. 
Judge Sutton, 
Percy 
Sutton, Manhattan bor­ ough president, and A.C. 
Sutton, Texas NAACP president, spoke at a m em orial service for their brother at the fifth annual NAACP Career 
Conference at Bowden 
Elementary School. 
Participated 
The late state repre­ sentative’s widow, .State 
Ftep. Loll Nolle Sutton, and his sister, Mrs. L il­ lian Sutton-Taylor, also participated in the ser­ vice. 
G.J. and A C. Sutton established the annual conference sponsored by the local branch of the 
National Assn. for the 

Advancement of Colored 
People five years ago. 
“ G.J , as all the Sut­ tons know, would have loved to be here today,” the borough president said Percy Sutton is also a 1977 mayoral candidate in New York City. 
“ He enjoyed having people talk about him. Ile had an ego but it was a well deserved ego,” the candidate said of his brother. 
“ Whatever he was to you, he was much more to all of us — his family. I want to pay tribute to my tactician, the man who prepared me p o litic a l­ ly.” 
Special guests 
Special guests at the memorial service includ­ ed City M gr. Thomas 
Huebner, Bist. Atty. Bill 
White, Bist. Judge Al 
Chapa and 
City 
Councilmen Joe Webb,

Huebner said San An­ tonio was fortunate to have a fam ily like the 
Suttons. 
“ How many fam ilies can boast of having had two state representa­ tives, a borough presi­ dent and a supreme court judge despite all the 

 struggles they must have gone through?” Huebner asked 
Cisneros agreed, calling G.J. “ a beacon, a symbol and an aspiration 

 of the dreams of a com­ munity. 
“ There are those who dedicate themselves to public good and then there are those who per­ 

 sonally become public institutions and lose all luxuries of being an indi­ vidual. 
“ G.J. Sutton became one of those men who 

 serves the public af a great personal cost, bul the harriers of being black, brown or a woman are gone thanks to men* like G.J.”

L.A. children line up for inoculations 

LOS A N G ELIS (AP) — Hundreds of parents and anxious youngsters waited in lines up to three miles long Saturday to get measles vaccinations in a last- minute effort to beat Monday's deadline imposed by the county board of health. 
No children were to be allowed into school on 
Monday without proof of having been vaccinated against 1o-day rubeola measles, which health of­ ficials say has reached epidemic proportions in the county. 
The epidemic has killed two persons and caused at least five cases of measles-related eneephalitits. officials said. 
More than 2,3oo cases of measles have been reported in the county since last fall and the number is increasing weekly, reaching proportions higher than any time since the longterm measles vaccine was introduced in 19H6. officials said. 
Not enforced 
Asked why there were so many unvaccinated children even though state law requires vaccination. 
Dr. Shirley Fannin of the county health department said. “ I guess you’d have to say the law’s never really been enforced.'’ 
More than half of the 2,3oo victims of the disease have been children of school age w ho should have been protected had the law been enforced. 
The immunization law requires that all children be immunized against measles, polio, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus before entering school. 
The law leaves enforcement up to the state health department. 
But the law does not extend enforcement instructions to the local level, leaving ambiguities us to whether local school officials or health officials should see that each child was actually vaccinated. 
The result was confusion and general lack of enfor­ cement of the law.

Former singer is dead at 91 

The man who beckoned 
“ Louis. Louis, meet me ut the fair.’' at the gates of the 19o4 Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition in 
St. Louis is dead at the age of 91. 
“ Little 
Eddie,’’ 
Charles Edward Plun­ kett. the famous child singer who was featured at the St. Louis World’s 
Fair, died Thursday in 
San Antonio. 
Plunkett, who was also a violinist, first per­ formed at the World s 
Columbian Exposition, the 1893 Chicago World’s 
Fair. 
In between the two lairs, he toured with 
Buffalo Bill and Annie 
Oakley. 
At 21. the child star de­ cided to travel west and settle down. He hom- steadcd in Nebraska, raised ll children and prospered in the cattle and meat market busi­ ness. 
But the 1929 stock market crash upset the 
Plunkett household and 
“ Little Eddie’’ had his family practicing music every moment they were not working the farm. 
Ile became a showman, formed the band, and the family started touring as 
The Plunketts, later the 
Plunkett Stage Show on the Fox Theater Circuit. 
One of his sons. Mel­ vin. also of San Antonio, became an animal trainer and was nick­ named Captain Fuzz by the Europeans. 

Like all showmen, the senior Plunkett traveled south for the winter and finally bought some pro­ perty' in San Antonio on 
Mission Road. 

Ile went into the con­ cession business and re­ tired six years ago. 
Funeral services will be conducted at 11:3o a.m. Monday in Mission 
Park Funeral Chapel with burial in Mission

San Antonio EX PR ESS - N E W S — Sunday M a y I 1977 
Nixon began stonewalling 

House legal counsel, was preparing to detail his knowledge to Justice De­ partment investigators. 
John D. Ehrlichman, then the White 
House domestic adviser, cautioned 
Nixon on April 25, for instance, that 
“ ifs entirely conceivable that if Dean is totally out of control’’ and the matter was not handled carefully, “ you could get a resolution of impeachment.” 
“ That’s right,” Nixon replied. 
Concern 
In one April 1973 conversation, 
Haldeman and Ehrlichman expressed grave concern that Nixon was concen­ trating too much on the Watergate matter. 
Ehrlichman urged the President to 
“ spend a week in Florida and not take calls” and let his staff conduct all 
White House business. “ Hell, they can’t wreck the country in a week,” 
Ehrlichman joked. 
Eater in that same conversation, 

Ehrlichman said, “ You are in a rotten frame of mind on this.” 
“ So are you,” retorted Nixon. 
The recorded conversations made available Saturday were prepared by the Watergate special prosecutors and circulated among prosecution and de­ fense lawyers involved in the 1974 fe­ deral court trial of Haldeman, Ehr­ lichman and three other principals in the Watergate case. The material, most of which duplicated other taped evidence or dealt largely with Nixon’s role rather than that of the defendants in the trial, never was introduced as evidence. 
Ironically, on an April 26, 1973 tran­ script among those disclosed Saturday, 
Nixon voiced confidence that the re­ corded conversations never would come to public attention. 
“ I don’t think it should ever get out that we taped this office, Bob,” he told 
Haldeman. “ Have we got people that are trustworthy on that? I guess we have.” 

Less than three months after that discussion, Alexander P. Butterfield, who had been Nixon’s appointments secretary, told the Senate Watergate 
Committee about the existence of the 
White House recording system. 
Although Nixon was not a defendant, he clearly was a central figure in the 
Watergate cover-up trial, since the chief evidence of the alleged conspir­ acy was contained in the tape recordings of conversations involving 
Nixon and his key aides. 
The first of those, which dated back to June 23, 1972, contained a conversa­ tion in which jurors heard Nixon giv­ ing an order to limit the F B I’s probe of the break-in, and doing so with no more apparent concern than a small town mayor might show in ordering a parking ticket fixed for a friend. 
“ Don’t lie to them to the extent to say there is no involvement, but just say this is a sort of comedy of errors 
. . .,” he told Haldeman. “ Say that we wish for the country, don’t go any 

 further into the case. 
In the later tapes, Nixon appeared nervous and distraught, and those same jurors heard him telephone 
Haldeman on the evening of April 25, 
1973, fretting over the possibility that 
Dean might secretly have tape record­ ed a conversation that could destroy his presidency. 
The previously-unpublished tapes do not add or detract measurably to the existing evidence that a conspiracy took place, but they do picture a White 
House in which frantic deliberations had become — by spring, 1973 — al­ most a daily routine. 
R e n e w e d 

On April 26, 1973, during a lengthy meeting in which Nixon and Haldeman discussed the need to immediately re­ place L. Patrick Gray III as the head of the FBI, and also began planning the resignations of Haldeman, Ehrlich­ man, and Attorney General Richard 
Kleindiensl, Nixon reviewed the steps 

 taken by the White House to limit the spread of the scandal. 
He concluded: 
“ We kept one jump ahead of the 
(expletive deleted) sheriff Now in thi case, that’s what we're doing. I know who the target is, Bob. I know this isn t gonna satisfy them. I know they hate my guts and they’re always gonna hate my guts. . .” 
Nixon did not dispute the potential of impeachment when Ehrlichman raised it with him on April 25. According to the transcript, the conversation went as follows: 
Ehrlichman: I don’t know if you’ve thought of this or not, but I got to thinking about it last night. Uh, on the ground that you committed a crime. 
Nixon: Right. 
Ehrlichman: And that there is no other legal process available to, uh, uh, the United States people other than 

Nixon: Right.

- r„ , days after the Watergate break-in 

Continued from previous page 

E h rlich m an : Other than impeach* merit. 
While part of that recorded conver­ sation m ade its way into the Watergate trial record, other impeachment dis­ cussions did not. By the following day, 
April 26, 1973. Nixon seemed to have c o n c lu d e d th a t E h rlic h m a n was o v e rsta tin g the risk and th at John 
D ean’s testim ony, by itself, was in­ adequate to imperil the President. 
The trail 
Told by Haldeman that a television co m m e n ta to r had suggested W a te r­ gate m ig h t lead, eventually, to im ­ peachment. Nixon replied: 
“ Bull (expletive deleted). Let me say that, ah, that was E h rlich m a n ’s point 
. . And that was John D ean’s point. But do you think the people, ah, the United States are gonna impeach the P re s id e n t on the basis of John 
Dean?” 
Several of the new transcripts also 

 made clear that Nixon had considera­ ble knowledge of the White House lia­ bility for the W atergate burglary well before Dean briefed the President fully in March 1973. 
The conversation that led directly to 
Nixon’s resignation was that of June 
23, 1972 — six days after the burglary 
— in which he and his aides laid plans to try to get the Central Intelligence 
Agency to persuade FBI officials not to delve too deeply into the so u rce of funding for the burglary. Nixon m ade that transcript public a few days be­ fore his departure from office. 
But a Ju n e 2o tran scrip t obtained 
Saturday showed that Nixon’s aw are­ ness of the risks to the White House had developed even earlier. 
He told Charles Colson that afternoon that it seemed outrageously unfair that the burglary should attract such notice in the media when Dr. Daniel Ellsberg had been in the White House view, lionized for supposedly making public the secret Pentagon study of the roots 

 of American involvement in the Viet­ nam war. 

Referring to Sen. George McGovern, his opponent in the 1972 presidential election, Nixon asked: 

“ Did McGovern, did The Times, did the (W ashington) Post squeal about that then? Now here was an attempted theft that failed, ag ain st a political party — not against the government of the United States. They give Pulitzer p rize s for p u b lis h in g sto len d o c u ­ m ents.” 

Colson sympathized and the two men talked of getting the point made pub­ licly by someone, lf a political party h e a d q u a r te rs is the ta rg e t, Colson said, “you get pilloried.” 

“ T hat’s great, g reat,” Nixon said of the suggested line of counterattack on th e issue. “ W ell, and th en too, of course,” he added, “ we arc just going to leave this where it is, with the Cu­ bans.” 

The allusion was to the m em bers of the Watergate burglary squad who had been recruited from the Cuban exile com m unity in M iami by E. Howard 
Hunt, a White House aide who had been a CIA agent involved in the abor­ tive 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of in 
Cuba. 

Colson, a friend of H unt’s, said he found it hard to believe Hunt was in­ volved in the W a terg a te m a tte r be­ c a u s e of th e way in w hich it was botched. “ He’s just too dam n shrewd,” 
Colson said. 

'S k illfu l' 

“ It doesn’t sound like a skillful job," 
Nixon agreed. “ If we didn't know bet­ ter, (I) would have thought it was deliberately botched.” 

In that sam e June 2o conversation, 
Nixon and Colson discussed a possible diversion of attention through prose­ 

 cution of The New York T im es for allegedly violating the federal election law s by p u b lis h in g an an ti-N ix o n advertisement without all the required identification of the sponsors. 

The advertisem ent in question, oc­ cupying two full pages in the May 31, 
1972, editions of The Times, called for the impeachment of Nixon for his con­ duct of the war in Indochina. 

“ T hey d o n ’t have m u ch of a d e ­ fense," Colson said of the newspaper. 
‘Then they’ll have to disclose who paid for the ad. And if it turns out that that may be traced back to McGovern peo­ ple. vou, you can m ake this bugging incident look puny by com parison.” 

Colson added that such a case could 
“ make, uh, eavesdropping at the Wa­ tergate Hotel look like child's play,” and Nixon replied: 

“ At times, uh, I just — stonewall it. 
T h ey ’re not gonna. . . “ His voice trailed off. according to the transcript.

GOF starts revamp at grass roots 

CHICAGO (AP) — The Republican party adopted a $1.5 million rebuilding p ro g ra m S aturday and agreed to start from the ground up with minority recruitment and a new em phasis on local politics. 
“I ’m convinced that’s the only way we can go.” said C harles Black, nam ed th e p a r t y ’s political director this week, who will be in charge of most of the grass roots campaign. 
“ Without this kind of base, th e re is no way a political party can hope to achieve any long-range success.” Black said. 
Criticism 
The program , which has stirred som e criticism from m ore conservative party m e m b e rs , passed with su rp risin g ease as the R ep u b lic an National 
C om m ittee approved a $7.5 m illio n 1977 budget which includes funds requested by party chairman 
Bill Brock to finance the recovery project. There was no discussion and no d iss e n t as the budget passed by voice vote. 
Basic elements in Brock’s program include: 
• An effort to recruit minorities, centered around targeted elections and promotion of minority can­ didates. 
• A redirection of party efforts toward campaigns for state legislative seats over the next two years. 
• An organizing campaign aim ed at state and local parties. 
Brock’s emphasis on the g rass roots is a radical departure from Republican preoccupation in recent years with the White House. T hat em phasis has seen success at the top and withering at the bottom. 
In 1972 Richard Nixon carried all but one state at the top of the ticket while the rest of the slate lost ground. Last fall s election left the GOF without a base in the White House, outnum bered 2-1 in Con­ gress and with only 12 g o v ern o rs and a sim ilar scarcity of local officials. 
Pressure 
Brock acknowledges he was under pressure to go for a “ quick fix” by burnishing the party image and concentrating on regaining the presidency, but he resisted in favor of rebuilding an organizational base. 
As p a rt of this approach he c o n tra c te d with 
Wright-McNeill & Associates, a black consulting firm, to handle the minorities p ro g ra m . The firm will concentrate on specific races, recruiting and prom oting black candidates an d en listin g black campaign workers. 
This is another change of em phasis from past GGP minority program s, which have tended to seek black votes without trying very hard to involve blacks in the actual work of the campaign. 
Conversely, Brock thinks th e q u ic k e s t way to break down their resistance is to show them blacks being elected as Republicans. 
Strategy 
The sam e strategy is planned tor other groups which traditionally vote Democratic, such as labor. 
This falls into another special project which will attempt to recover ground in state legislatures — an especially critical area since these bodies will reap­ portion the nation after the 198o census. Democratic dominance could leave Republicans without a voice in redistricting. 
Republicans currently control only 19 out of 99 state legislative bodies in the country. 
Brock has an additional objective in this program: developing a new generation of attractive candidates and a core of campaign workers. 
Fifteen such organizers are already in place and 
Black says he hopes to have another 2o out by June.

J 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Carter will meet i in London w ith leaders of England. France and West 
J Germany in ‘‘a very private meeting" after the eeon- lomic summit next weekend to talk about political matters related to Berlin, the White House said Sa­ turday. 
File meeting May 9 is seen as an opportunity to talk about a variety of issues beyond those directly related to the divided city inside the East German borders. 
Carter is then scheduled to fly to Geneva to talk with 
President Hafez Assad of Syria. 
The President disclosed the meeting in London to the directors of the Radio Television News Directors 
Association at a question-and-answcr session he had w ith them at the White House on Friday. A transcript of the meeting was released by the White House Sa­ turday. 

 stalemated Geneva talks aimed at bringing about a reduction in European troops. 
“ I think we will form personal friendships and interrelationships that will stand us in good stead in a time of trouble, of crisis," he said. 
The Berlin situation is seen as an opportunity for a m inisum m it in which the United States and the leaders of the three major European powers can get together in a group smaller than the 15-member NA­ 
TO gathering, 
But the topic at the center will be Berlin, although there are no burning questions relating to it. 
During the Friday meeting, the President said: 
• Water shortages may become “ a chronic prob­ lem;” 
• He did not have any alternative to his proposal for a tax on gasoline to encourage energy conservation; 

• His administration will put into effect by the end of fiscal 1977 (Sept. 3o) plans to reduce the number of reports required by the government; 
• When he and Congress disagree “ it is better for me to maintain my position even though it might create some disharmony within the Congress, if I think I am right.” 

The President said polls showed that fewer than 5o per cent of the American people believed there w as a serious energy problem “ before I went public with our analysis and our proposals.” 
He said that now as many as 7o to 8o per cent of the 
American people agree that the country faces a ser­ ious crisis if it does not take action. He did not offer any other details about the polls.

Bilateral meetings 

The President also said that w hile in London he would hold bilateral meetings with most European leaders. 
The President flies to London on Thursday. The seven-nation economic summit conference will be held next Saturday and Sunday. He returns lo Wa­ shington Tuesday, May IO, after a meeting of the 15 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Carter told the broadcast officials that in addition to economic questions, topics likely to be discussed during his European visit would include human rights, nuclear nonproliferation, relations with the less developed countries, possible approaches to a strategic arm s lim itation a g re e m e n t and the

S aturday that U.S. Se­ cretary of State Cyrus 
Vance has offered to open a so-called se c re t d ia ­ logue with him. 
A lthough B h u tto d e ­ clined to be more speci­ fic. a State Department spokesm an in W ashing­ ton said: 
"After the prime m in­ iste r m ad e the a lle g a ­ tions of U.S. support for the opposition, which are groundless, the secretary wrote him a letter ex­ pressing our views. The secretary reaffirmed that the United States is not interfering in Pakistani domestic affairs. 
"He also expressed a willingness for the two governments to discuss any differences between us in the spirit of the lo n g s ta n d in g r e la tio n ­ ship between P akistan and the U.S.”

In eight weeks of often violent antigovernm ent d e m o n s tra tio n s m o re than 2oo p ersons have been killed. 
Witnesses said Bhutto, standing in an open jeep before som e 2,ooo su p ­ porters, waved what he said was a letter from 
Vance offering to open talks. When Bhutto asked for "affirm ation of the m asses” before replying to V ance, th e crow d cheered in approval.

ADDIS ABABA - The le a d e r of

Marxist m ilitary govern­ ment, Lt. Col. Mengistu 
Haile M ariam, will make an official visit to Mos­ cow next week. 
In announcing this, the government-controlled radio confirmed reports the United S tates has stopped delivery of HOO million w orth of arm s and ammunition to Eth­ iopia. 
D u rin g his Moscow visit, Mengistu is expect­ ed to seek Soviet arms and supplies to replace those w ithheld by Wa­ shington. There also was sp e c u la tio n h ere that 
Ethiopia’s expulsion of large num bers of Ameri­ cans in recent days may have been a pre-condition set by R ussia for any arm s deal. 

Russia seeks

DAMASCUS - The 
Soviet Union asked Syria to provide it with mili­ tary facilities but the re­ quest was refused, ac­ cording to a source pre­ sent at Syrian President 
Hafez Assad’s talks with 
Soviet leaders in Moscow last week. 
While the Russians did not use the word "bases” in their request, the Syr­ ian source said the intent was obvious to all who heard it. 
"T h ey w anted to e s ­ tablish military bases on our soil,” he said flatly. 
Assad is to meet with 
P re s id e n t 
C a rte r in

M A G G IE BURNETT is still waiting 
Maggie still waits for MIA husband 

A S S O C IA T E PR ISS 
PELHAM . N II - The 
Vietnam war never end­ ow for Maggie Burnett. 
She still nears the stiver missing-in-adion bracelet of lier soldier husband on her right 
* wrist. 
On her left hand is the wedding band and the miniature West Point ring, the one Shelly Bur-' nett gave her for their engagement. 
The memories are haunting, overwhelming. 
Tears well up i i i the hazel eyes and her voice cracks. 
She was from (helms* lord, Mass., he from 
Milwaukee. 
“ We met on a blind date at 
West 
Point she recalls. “ It is the tradition- 
-* al engagement ring. I got his, too. 
It came hack with his things. Ile never won* it. Ile never wanted anyone to know whether he was or wasn't from West Point. We ll 
2 lie married 23 years in 
.lune.’’ 
Missing 

Col. Sheldon Burnett. 
•Iii, minored cavalry 
* squadron commander, has been listed as miss­ ing in action since March 
7. 1971. shot down in a helicopter inst inside 
Laos. on the Vietnamese border. 
Life has been lonely for 
Mrs. Burnett. 47, her hair turned gray. 
- 
There have been oilier 
' tragedies — death and illness — in the family i i i the six years that her husband has been 
: missing. 
I 
The children have grown up too fast and left 
* her too soon. Michael. 2i, in away at school. I oigh 
, 
Ann, 2o. was married last 
January. 
Steven died 2*^ years after his father was reported missing. He was only ll. 
“ He and two other boys were in the woods play­ ing with matches.“ Mrs. 
Burnett remembers, her voice breaking. “ They had a gasoline eau and he caught on fire and inhaled fumes.’’ 
Sirens 
Seven months before he died. Steven heard the sirens wailing in the town, heralding the sign­ ing of the January 1973 
Paris peace agreements that called for a Vietnam cease-lire and the witb- 
, dravval of all American 
* forces. y 
“ Mom, I don’t know where Daddy is,’’ he told 
<• his mother. 
"We haven't known lur a long time. Steven.’’ she 
* told him. 
“ But it’s all over now.” he replied. 
2 
Mrs. Burnett says that 
- Steven could accept his 
* father missing while the war was going un. but when it was over he vv tin ted him back. 
Only Iris h , 13. dirty blonde hair and eyes that change colors, mostly gray and blue, is at home now. She is the pet of the family. 

“ Irish goes to bed at n me o’clock and I sit here.’’ says Mrs. B u r­ nett. “ I read aint I don't have a boy friend. I nev er had a boy friend. I had lour knI-* to raise. 
"I'm committed to my family. Could you see them if I brought a stranger in here? Iv e never really met anyone. 
I don't know what would happen ii I did.” 
Mrs. Burnett has been involved with tilt* League of Families of the miss­ ing iii action. Sin* had al­ so been working 49 hours a week as a volunteer 

V M I Ii Hie Better Business 
Bureau. She still receives 

 her husband's lull pay and allowances. 
But she was forced to drop volunteer work recently when a bleeding ulcer hospitalized her for a second time. She is back home now. 

Pressure 
“ My ulcer tends to bleed when I get too much pressure.'' she said, as she chain­ smokes cigarettes. “ Two weeks alter Christmas. my daughter got mar­ ried. Then there was a big snow storm right after Christmas. Irish hurt her knee skiing and was laid up at home for 
23 days,” 
Irish, who turned 7 a week before her lather was reported missing, underwent a year of psy­ chotherapy in 1975. 
“ I thought it was because of her brother.” 
Mrs. Burnett says. "She saw Steven on fire. I had to leave the hall light on at night. She was afraid of Steven’s room. It was the bedroom where my lather died 19 days before 
Shelly was reported missing. Then Steven had that room and died. 
And she thought it was haunted. 
“ I thought that was the problem. But the doctors told me it was more because she didn't remember her father. 
She was confused and didn't know how she should feel about him because lie's still so alive and we talk about him all the time. But she s a dif­ ferent child now. a lot more outgoing.” 
Irish says she didn’t really cry. 
Sadness 
“ I didn’t know ii I should feel had and cry like my mother.’’ she says.“ She was so sad. I remember nothing at all about him. All I know is that he is tall aud I was his pet. My mother tells me stuff about him. like what he used lo do when I was little." 
Mrs. Burnett says she knows her husband is dead. 
“ Bul for me to make that decision is almost like murder.” she says. 
“I don’t have that right. ”

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday M ay 1 I 977 
Status of legislation cry 
Ex-solon, Korea split on adviser role 

EXPRESS N E W S O kW TO l BUREAU 
AUSTIN - As of Sun­ day here was the status of important issues of local interest pending in the H5th Legislature .'JO d ay s b efo re a d jo u rn ­ ment: 
Teacher pay raises — 
Still to be decided and in a slightly contused state is how much to allow for teacher pay raises, if an­ ything, for the next two years. 
The House Public Edu­ cation C om m ittee has drafted two bills to in­ c r e a s e te a c h e r re tire ­ ment benefits some $213 million while the Senate 
Education Committee is eyeing a proposal to give teachers pay hikes of 5.1 per cent in 1978 and 3.2 per cent in 1979. The 
Senate committee is also looking at providing in­ creases for the lith and 
12th y e a rs of teaching experience for a total es­ timated cost of $32o mil­ lion 
Neither proposal would get very far unless funds are m a d e a v ailab le . 
Nearly all of the state’s spen d in g s u r p lu s has been gobb led up, but 
House m e m b e r s last week trimmed more than 
$15o million — intended for the benefit of teacher s a la rie s — from their general appropriations hill. 
Gas Storage — Legis­ lation which .sponsor Sen. 
John Traegcr of Seguin says will help stop gas, curtailments in San An-' tonio lost its first round in the Senate last week — partly because of its ties 1 to Lo-Vaca Gathering Co. I 
Som e of the m ost! powerful m embers of the 
Senate rallied against 
T r a e g e r ’s g a s storage bill because it would help 
Lo-Vaca. 
SB8o1 would give gas companies, if approved by the T exas Railroad 
Commission, authority to exercise eminent domain in a c q u ir in g un der­ ground g a s storage re­ servoirs. 
Lo-Vaca officials ha vt reported the company is developing a gas storage field in South Texas ti provide backu p g as supplies during peak de m aud periods. A com puny lobbyist testified before the Senate Natural 
R e so u rc e s Committee that condem nation powers would virtually insure completion of the reservoir project. 
Traeger says he will try again with his bill next week in anticipation of two favorable votes from senators who were not presen t last week when the m easure was first ta kern up. 
CPS Board 
— State 
Rep. Joe Hernandez of 
San Antonio is having problems with his HB375 proposing to giv e San 
Antonio City Council authority to appoint trustees to City Public 
Service. 
The House Calendars 
Committee has still not acted on Hernandez’ bill even though Hernandez has marked the bill his priority legislation. 
Last week Hernandez wrote a letter to House 
Speaker Bill Clayton re­ questing the speaker to bring his bill up to a 
House vote. Hernandez will know next week whether his bill will get a vote after the House has finished trim m in g the 
H ouse A pp ro priatio n s bill. 
T rad e Zone 
— No p ro b le m s here. 
The 
House last week gave unanimous approval to a bill sponsored by Rep. 
Ron Bird to establish a duty-free foreign trade zone in San Antonio. It sailed through on the 
House local consent ca­ lendar and was sent to the Senate. HB2191, if finally passed, would al­ low the city to apply for a gran t to estab lish the trade zone at Interna­ tional Airport, with sub­ zones elsewhere in the city. Next step for Bird's bill will be assignment to the ap p rop riate Senate committee. 
Pari-mutuel 
— Consi­ dered a lost cause by most sources, a bill al­ lowing for legalized pari­ mutuel wagering on a local option basis should get its final vote Tuesday- before the House Inter­ g o v ern m en tal A ffairs 
Committee. 
Happy days 

JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 
— This oil-rich desert kingdom has begun a week-long celebration to mark the return of King 
Khaled from a London hospital where he under­ went hip surgery. 

A subcommittee study­ ing the T e x a s Horse 
Racing Act since April 12 relu ctan tly referred 
HBI499 last week to the full committee. The bill has been loaded down with 25 amendments plus recommendation that it not pass. Subcommittee m e m b e r 
Rep. 
Fran k 
Tejeda of San Antonio is the c o m m itte e ’s most vocal opponent of the horse race betting bill. 
P olls taken of the 
12-m em ber com m ittee show eigh t are still strongly opposed to the bill. 
Bingo 
— The House 
Calendars Committee is still holding on to Senate 
Jo in t Resolution 2 by 
Sen. Frank Lombardino of San Antonio. Like a lot of other non-local legislation, the bingo re­ solution must wait for full House consideration until House m em b ers have finished with the appropriations bill. 
Lombardino’s measure has been approved by both the Senate and 
House 
Constitutional 
A m en d m en ts com ­ mittees and now needs a two-thirds vote in the 
House, lf finally passed, 
SJR2 would be placed on the 1978 ballot for voters to decid e whether to amend the constitution to allow bingo and certain ruffles to raise funds for charity. 

N EW YORK TIMES SERVICE 
W ASHINGTON - A former member of the 
House Select Committee on*Intelligence has with­ drawn as legal counsel lo the Korean Embassy be­ cause diplom ats there rejected his advice to cooperate with the J u s ­ tice Department in the 
Korean bribery scandal. 

The Korean Embassy, according to documents on file at the Justice De­ p artm en t, retained 
J a m e s V. Stanton in 
January just after he left the C on gress. He was chairman of a subcom ­ mittee that investigated the U.S. Central Intell- gence Agency in 1975. 

Stanton, whose con­ tract with the Koreans called for “ consultation and advice in a connec­ tion with any legal m at­ ters affectin g the e m ­ bassy and its employes as well as in connection with legal m atters a f ­ fecting the Republic of 
Korea,” advised the Kor­ ean government to coo­ perate fully with the 
Department of Justice in its investigation of a l­ leged Korean bribery of 
American congressmen, according to sources fa­ miliar with the issue. 
But Korean diplomats rejected that advice, the sources said, although they wanted Stanton to give the appearance of cooperating.

Trade center hopes high 

EXPRESS N EW S CAPIE O I BUREAU 

AUSTIN — San Antonio’s hopes of becoming an international trade center got a big boost in the House last 
Thursday with the passage of Rep. Hon 
Bird’s HB2I91. 
The bill now goes to the Senate. where quick action is expected, and then on to the governor's desk for signing into law. 
Under HB2191. San Antonio — or a non-profit corporation it designates — can apply for federal money to estab­ lish a ’duty free foreign trade zone at 
International Airport. 

It is also authorized to establish sub-zones elsewhere within the city. 
Once established, the zone will allow the importation of foreign products and m aterials without the importer paying the usual duty or posting bonds required by federal law. 
The duty is paid by the purchaser when the products are delivered to 

 their final destination in the state or country. 
Supporters of the hill say it will be a boost to the annual Mexican Trade 
F a ir hut. more important, might lead to the e s ta b lish m e n t of a permanent trade center in the city. 
The bill passed the House by a vote of 133-o and one m em ber of the B exar 
County delegation culled it “ one of the most important single pieces of legis­ lation passed for San Antonio in this session.”

B ry a n t’s efforts to cut the entire funding went down to defeat by a 72-57 m argin after q counter attack led by 
Rep. Jim Nuegent of Kerrville. A no’ vote is against cutting the funding.

Chicanos denounce domestic spying 

B y DAVID H EN D R IC K S 
Illegal government surveillance is practiced on everyone active in politics, especially the Chicano political movement in Texas, a form er National 
Security Council member said Saturday. 
Dr. Morton Halperin spoke on government infil­ tration tactics along with Raza Cnida party organ­ izer .lose Angel Gutierrez at a fundraising benefit for the American Civil Liberties Union. 
The ACLU soon will file a suit on behalf of Raza 
Cnida charging the Central Intelligence Agency, tilt' 
FBI and the State of Texas have tried to disrupt the 
Mexican-American party. 
Gutierrez, the Zavala County judge, read from 5oo pages of documents detailing what he called crimes against civil liberties. 
Halperin. who was a member of the National .Se­ curity Council in the Nixon Administration, said the 
U.S. in te llig e n c e com m unity has gone from gathering information about certain organizations to trying to destroy organizations seen as subversive. 
Incited 
Through informants, the FB I and CIA have sent fake letters and spread information designed to provoke violence, disagreement and even murder, said Halperin. who now directs the Campaign to Stop 
Government Spying. 
He said evidence shows the F B I often know in advance of the assassinations of civil rights leaders in the South. 
“The amazing thing is that there is no legislation now to stop this kind of thing.” Halperin said. 
He added that surveillance is pratdiced on all active political groups, including {host- in the wo­ 

 men s rights and environmental movements. 
"A s best as I can tell, if you are close to (U.S. 
Sen.) Barry Coldwater, you're safe," Halperin said. 
“ If you're to the left or right of Coldwater, then you're in trouble.” 
Allegation 

Gutierrez charged Gov. Dolph Briscoe and Atty. 
Gen. John Hill with attacking Raza Cnida solely to help their chances in the 1978 governor's race. lie cited Briscoe's freeze on federal funding for economic development in Zavala County last Sep­ tember. 
The federal money was later granted despite 15 investigations by the state to find something wrong with the applicants, Gutierrez said. 
The county judge also said Hill maintains an at­ torney general’s office in Crystal City for the pur­ pose of a continuing investigation into Raza Cnida activities there. 
No convictions 
Three indicted party officials have not been con-, vialed in the courts, Gutierrez added. 
He also quipped that party officials send their income tax returns directly to the audit division of the Internal Revenue Service lo speed up the pro­ cess, rather than waiting for the IRS to receive audit orders. 
The suit on behalf of Raza Cnida has not been filed yet. Gutierrez said, and ACLU lawyers are studying the court system to find the best place to try the case.

Legislation eyed as threat to surety panel 

AUSTIN (AP) - State 
Insurance Board Chair­ man Joe Christie says he strongly opposes a bill that would strip away the board's authority to re­ gulate Blue Cross — and. thus, hospital — rates. 

The bill has been ap-, proved by the House In­ surance Committee and awaits a place on the’ 
House calendar. 
* 
Granted, the board's authority over Blue Cross rates is a sword that hasn’t been out of its scabbard in 38 years. 
But Christie says it would be needed if the legislature fails to ap­ prove a proposed new state commission to con­ trol hospital costs. He warns that the alterna­ tive would be federal controls. 
Blue Cross is about the only source of hospital cost controls in Texas.

Analysis 

 but critics maintain it usually rubber stamps price increases request­ ed by the hospitals. 
If the hospital com­ mission bill dies — as well it might at this late stage in the legislative session — “ I would want us to move to the fullest extent of our authority." 
Christie said in an inter­ view. 
Christie said the board 
"has kicked around’’ how much authority that provision really gives w ithout reaching any real decision, but "I am opposed to any change in our authority over Blue 
Cross.’’ 
His stance puts him at odds with 
Insurance 
Commissioner Joe Haw­ kins. who wrote the bill. 
The board, as suehn has taken no official po­ sition on the bill. 
No position 

Haw kins points out that another provision of the measure would enable the board to withdraw 

 approval of a Blue Cross policy form if rates were too high for the benefits provided. 

"I just happen to feel it is a lot more appropriate that the board have this authority.” 
Hawkins said. 

What about the policyholder if the board exercises the extreme sanction and withdraws approval of his Blue 
Cross policy in the ab­ sence of the power to simply force a rate adjustment? 

“ The policyholder would have the oppor­ tunity to go to the mar­ ketplace and get another deal if Blue Cross is too high ... A group ought to welcome the action.’’ he said. 
There also is another concern. 

Guarantee 

The bill takes out a requirement that par­ ticipating hospitals guar­ antee benefits to policyholders should 
Blue Cross ever fold. 

An fawaii ry’ by any other name 

A stained glass window has graced the dome of the Territorial Office 
Building in Honolulu for 51 years. 
It was not until remodeling began recently that someone noticed the window was incorrectly assembled. 
Part of the window — a replica of the Territorial seal — reads, “ awaii ry of II Territo” instead of Territory of Hawaii. 
The remodelers say they will not change a thing. 
"It has historic significance,” says architect Herbert Matsumura.

Sure-fire way to lower your property taxes 

Bob Wister figures he can lower his V board until its worth what he paid property taxes by razing his house. 
He says he is going to begin ripping his Hayward, Calif., house apart board 
Proper perspective 

The brass complained when a le­ gislative budget committee voted to subsidize college tuition as an incen­ tive for enlisting in the Wisconsin 
National Guard. 
After Sen. Gerald Kleczka of Mil­ waukee said it should help recruit­ ment. Rep. Ronald Lingren of subur­

“ As an officer, I have to ask that question,” Lingren said. 

“ As you can probably tell, I was an enlisted man,” Kleczka replied.

“ I will rip down what is sufficient to get it down to the 1973 assessed value when I bought it,” he said, vowing to stop only when a real estate appraiser tells him he has reached the right value. 
“ That’s what I can afford,” he said. 
“ I can’t afford what it is now and 1’rii not going to stand for it. It practically doubles my taxes from what they were in 1973.” 
Wister paid $28,ooo for the house when he bought it. The latest assess­ ment is for $38,2oo. about 15 per cent over last year. 

That’s no guest; that’s his horse 

Louie Fletcher likes to have Sugar at the table at meal times, so his horse by that name eats with him. 
Fletcher, 67, a retired auto mechan­ ic. moved to the country life near Mo­ desto. Calif., after his wife died so he 
Vould tinker with cars and keep some pets — two horses, two dogs and a cat. 
“ I didn’t want to do like some of them other old people, sittin’ in their hotel rooms, grievin,” he says. 
But to ease the lonliness of eating alone, Fletcher began to let the 
8-year-old Welsh bay munch her food from a large pan placed on one* end of the table while he eats at the other end. 
“ She eats anything,” Fletcher says. 
“ We get along just fine.”

Hoover OKd mailing to activist 

W A S H IN G T O N p o s t s e r v i c e 

WASHINGTON - Former FBI Dir­ ector J. Edgar Hoover and other top officials of the FBI hierarchy person­ ally approved the anonymous mailing of a reprint of a New York Times article concerning anti-Semitism to various antiestablishment political ac­ tivists in September 197o. according to court records and informed sources. 

Among those who received the mailing was Marcus Raskin, a fellow at the leftist Institute for Policy 
Studies here. 

The mailing was one of three in­ stances in which the FBI has admitted that Raskin or other IPS employes were on the receiving end of disruptive activity under the F B I’s controversial and now-discarded domestic intelli­ 

 gence program. 
Although 
Hoover’s direct involvement in and approval of the 
F B I’s domestic intelligence program has previously been reported, the in­ stances involving the IPS are the first in which it is clear that even routine mailings under the program received the personal attention of top-level FBI officials.

CONGRESSIONAL 
ROLL CALL 

W A S H IN G T O N 
— 
Votes of a re a members of Congress on key roll colls for the week ending April 29: 
Senate 
Tax cuts. Bv a vote of 4o 59, the Senate defeated a move to permanently reduce income tax rates in lower and middle income brackets bv between 4 and 14 per cent. The permanent cuts represented a 
Repu blican a lte rn a tiv e to P re s id e n t 
Carter s economic recovery plans, and the vote was largely along party lines. 
The administration had strenously op­ posed such permanent cuts, arguing they would fuel inflation and cost the treasury billions of dollars needed for future ini­ tiatives in areas like welfare, health care, and tax reform. 
Supporters of the permanent tax cut had argued that additional stimulus is in the form of tax cuts was needed to reduce unemployment and sustain the economic recovery over the next several years. 
They also claimed the cuts could help offset the effects of inflation, which moved many taxpayers into higher tax brackets. 
Opponents disputed the economic ar. guments, claiming that other portions of the President s package would prove suf­ ficiently stimulative. They further labeled the amendment "an exercise in futility," predicting that Congress would not be able to override a certain veto from 
Carter. 
Voting for tax cut: Tower ( R ). 
Voting against tax cut: Bentsen (D ). 
House 
Defense spending. 
In a victory for the 
Pentagon and President Carter, the House voted 225-184 to raise a budget target tor defense spending in fiscal year 1978 bv 
$4.1 billion — to the Si2o.1 billion level requested by the President. 

Supporters of the higher defense spending target argued that the P re sident’s request should be granted in light of a Soviet n,i!!tury buildup and the need to strengthen the U.S. position in arm s limitation talks with the Soviets. 
Opponents of raising the defense budget target contended that great restraint had been shown in recommending spending targets for domestic programs, that the increase would d estro y the d e lic a te balance of support necessary to pass the budget targets and that the recommended cuts would eliminate unnecessary Pen ­ tagon spending without weakening U.S. defenses. 
Voting to increase defense spending targets: Gonzalez 
(D ), Kazen 
( D I, 
Krueger (D). . 
Troop withdrawal. 
Bv a vote of 88-3o1, the House overw helm ingly rejected a move to withdraw 17,ooo U.S. ground troops from foreign bases and to cut total troop strength by 5o,ooo. The vote was on on amendment to the fiscal 1978 Defense 
Authorization Bill. 
Supporters of the troop reduction a r­ gued that the troops could be removed from South Korea. They insisted that 
American public opinion would not sup­ port a war in behalf of South K o rea’s military dictatorship. 
Opponents pointed out that President 
Carter had already pledged to remove the 
5o,ooo U.S. ground troops from Korea over a five-vear period. They warned that passage of the amendment would under­ mine negotiations with Japan and South 
Korea to achieve that goal. 
Voting for w ith d raw al of o ve rse a s troops: None. 
Voting against withdrawal of overseas troops: 
Gonzalez 
( D ) , 
Kazen 
( D ), 
Krueger (D).

Something Beautiful for Everyone.® 

HOUSTON (AP) - A spokesman for the Inter­ faith Center of New York accused Tenneco, Inc., 
Friday of trying to block the unionization of farm workers on lands owned by the company in 

California. 
Henry J. Frundt, ap­ pearing to provide infor­ mation to show its acqui­ sition of acreage "wasn't forcing the small family farmer out of business." 
Frundt appeared in 

 behalf of a proposal of­ fered by the Sisters of 
Charity, ubuque, Iowa, and the Sisters of St. 
Francis. Rockford, 111. 
The proposal was d e f e a t e d o v e r w Ii e I rn • ingly.

Stormy weather prevails in Texas 

ASSOCIATED PKSS 
Rain was back in the Texas forecast for all but the western tip of the state Saturday as severe weather moved into the state. 
Showers and thunderstorms were evident from the lower Gulf Coast late Saturday morning north through San Antonio, Waco and east beyond Dallas. 
Weather forecasters issued a tornado warning for 
Cameron County after a tornado was spotted north of 
Brownsville. There were no reports of the tornado touching down. 
Marine warnings were also in effect through most of the morning for boating enthusiasts in Southeast 
Texas and especially in the Corpus Christi area. 
In addition to the heavy rains, the National Weather 
Service reported wind gusts moving inland near the resort community approaching 2o miles per hour. 
The heaviest rainfall recorded in the 24-hour period ending Saturday was between Waco and Stephenville where amounts of 2 to 4 inches fell. Tiny Morgan. 
Tex., just west of Lake Whitney recorded 3.4o inches. 
While most of Central Texas was getting soundly doused, skies west of Del Rio to south of Lubbock were generally clear with afternoon temperatures in the 7os and low 8os. Extremes late Saturday morning ranged from 6o at Dalhart to 79 at Brownsville. 
Beadings elsewhere were not noticably affected by the cloud cover and rains. Wichita Falls was under partly cloudy skies with 7o-degree readings, Dallas- 
Fort Worth, cloudy and 73. Longview was cloudy and 
76.

Committee to pick outstanding student 

The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial and the South­ west Voter Registration Education Project have appointed Tino Guerra chairman of the selection committee for the memorial’s Intern Exchange 
Program. 
An outstanding bilingual graduating senior from 
Bexar County will be selected to participate by the committee. 
The Intern-Exchange Program is designed to provide outstanding bilingual students a first-hand experience in government and a different U.S. geographic area. 
The joint effert between SVREP and the memorial is part of a pilot program that will be expanded in the future.

Apartment meters 

I am curious about those plans to put meters in individual apartments. 
Who pays for people who skip out on rents AND utilities? 
Doesn’t this mean that all the other tenants will have to pay for the deadbeats in the apartment? 
Isn’t this unfair to those who do pay their utility bills? 
And what about the apartment? What if City 
Public Service refuses to put the lights back on until the bill is paid? 

D. D. 

C 
A^> USUAL - WE HAVE 
"TO PAY FOR T H E 

DEADBEATS// 

T " 

At this paint, City 

Public Service is net making the individual apartment complexes pick op the bills for ten­ ants who skip not without paying their utilities. instead, the less is ab­ sorbed by all 
CPS 

 easterners, net Just the tenants of a single apart­ ment complex. 
However, the situation 

 on unpaid utility bills is becoming more and more serions. 
While the number of 

 apartment complexes which have Individual meters is a small per­ centage of the total apartments In the city, if that number increases substantially, Action-Ex­ press predicts the 

 number of skips on utili­ ty bills will increase in nearly geometric propor­ tions. 
The number of rent 

 skips now is mind-bog­ 

 gling and the same would go for individual utili­ ties. 
Even without all the 

 apartments on individual meters, the energy 

 crunch has caused the number of unpaid and uncollectable CPS bills to doable since last year. lf the situation begins 

 to worsen and more apartments adopt indivi­ dual meters, CPS may not be able to write off 
$5o,ooo and $1oo,ooo bills owed by former tenants of apartment complexes. 
The owners will probably be forced to cough ap all or part of the owed bills and they, in tarn, will raise the rents. 
Right now, however, 

 the apartment managers see the individual meters as a way to reduce their operating costs. In the long run. that plan could backfire if there are too many unpaid utility bills. 

Diamond dilemma 

We recently purchased a diamond from a local firm. We paid about $75o for a carat diamond. 

However, we have since discovered the diamond has a flaw. 
We took it back to the store and were refused a refund. 

When I asked why I was never told there was a flaw in the diamond, the manager told me: “ You never asked.” 

They would only give us credit for purchase of a larger diamond. 
Is this any way to do business? 

Now I find out that EVERY diamond in the place has flaws and I can’t get a good one no matter how- much I pay. 

SPARKLES IN MY EYES 

Okay, there is a lesson 

 here for Action-Express readers to remember. 
Diamonds, like ever­ ything else, are available in a variety of grades. 

There ARE perfect 

 diamonds. However, they are expensive — or at least more expensive than flawed diamonds. 
There is even a “ brand name” diamond which is guaranteed to be perfect. 
The guarantee is written. 

Some flawed diamonds 

 are very beautiful and the flaws are sometimes not readily visible to the naked eye. Others have large carbon specks or other flaws which one may miss upon examina­ tion at the store, bat which become apparent upon more detailed exa­ mination at home. 

San Antonio’s finest 

 jewelery stores will tell yon the quality of the diamond you are looking at even if yon don’t ask. 
Others will readily teli 

 you if asked whether the diamond is perfect and will also be perfectly honest about the nature of the flaws. 
Still others will try to 

 evade the issue of flaws unless pressed about the matter. 

Certainly, the fact this 

 large diamond outlet carries only imperfect stones ought to be a warning to young couples and others who are shop­ ping for diamonds for the first time. 

Yon only get what you 

 pay for. There really are no such things as “ cut­ rate” diamonds. Any cnt-rate price usually means cut-rate quality. 

If you want a perfect 

 diamond, you may have to ask for it. The store makes a great deal of difference in what kind of diamond yon wind up with — but so does a little bit of knowledge on the part of the person buying it. 

Emissions 

Will you settle an argument for us? My father says the Volkswagen Rabbit Diesel meets all the U.S. emission requirements. 

I say no car does and that is why they are trying to delay the implementation of the 1978 standards. 
Who is right? 

GARY G. 

There is a trick to this 

 question, which is proba­ bly why your father will win. 
You see, there are NO 

 emission standards for diesels at this time. Some are expected as diesel autos become more po­ pular, but the big emis­ sion crackdown now is aimed at gasoline en­ gined cars which account for about 99.9 per cent of the auto sales in the U.S. 
The Rabbit Diesel, 

 however, dees meet al­ most ail of the proposed federal emission stan­ dards far GASOLINE powered cars - and with 

 flying colors. The only emission standard it cannat meet is that of ni­ trous oxides. And there is already a push to revise that standard since there is no evidence nitrous oxides actually cuase photochemical smog and all the experts say their reduction is absolutely beyond the possibilities of all existing technology. 

So the answer is really, 

 yes and no, depending upon what emission 

 standards you are talking about. 

Aren’t yon glad we 

 cleared that up for you?

Gas tax promises only scant savings

WASHINGTON POST StBVICf 
WASHINGTON - Pre­ sident Carter’s proposed gasoline tax will result in relatively scant gasoline savings — only about 
4oo,ooo barrels a day by 
1985 — if it is put into law, according to the ad­ m in istra tio n ’s own ex­ perts and a number of leading private econo­ mists. 
C a rte r ’s energy ex­ perts expect that the ga­ soline tax will rise to 35 cents a gallon by 1985 if it is passed as proposed. A 
35-cent tax would take about $35 billion out of the public’s pocket. 
The limited gasoline saving, which would be about twice the amount 
Americans now save by observing the 
55-mile-per-hour speed limit, could throw yet another obstacle in the legislative path of the a d m in istra tio n ’s most co n tro versial energy- saving proposal. 
Legislators who do not want to vote for a gaso­ line tax in the first place are hardly likely to be spurred on if it seems the lax will not accomplish much. 
Standby tax 
Carter’s “ standby” ga­ soline tax would raise the federal excise 5 cents a gallon each year con­ sumption rises above fe­ deral ta rg e ts. The ta r ­ gets would allow for a slight in crease in con­ sum ption in 1978 and 
1979; from 198o through 
1987, consumption would have to drop. In years the ta rg e t is m et, the tax would drop 5 cents a gal­ lon. 
U nder C a r te r ’s plan the m axim um tax in­ crease over the next de­ cade would be 5o cents. 
The federal gasoline tax is now 4 cents a gallon. 
Given the proposed targets and likely U.S. consumption totals, ad­ m in istra tio n planners think the tax would be 35 cents by 1985. According to documents obtained by the Washington Post, the planners think that, with that large a tax, gasoline consumption would drop to 6.6 million barrels a day in 1985 from the 7 million it would be oth­ erwise. 
An in crease of one penny in gasoline taxes, 
C arter energy experts say. would increase fe­ deral revenues by rough­ ly $1 billion a year. 
Thus Carter is asking 
Congress to pass a tax that would add $35 billion a year in gasoline costs in 
1985 to save very little. 
Proceeds 
The a d m inistration says the proceeds from the gasoline tax would be returned to the public through cuts in income taxes and possibly other means. Even so, the cost and savings numbers will be crucial in determining the future of C a rt. 
When asked about the gasoline tax Friday, Sen. 
Russell B. Long (D.La.) said, “ I don’t believe in leading a crusade if the num bers and the votes aren’t there.” 
Long, according to a member of his staff, sees little support for the ga­ soline tax in the Senate. 
As chairman of the Sen­ ate Finance Committee 
Long will oversee all the energy taxation ques­ tions in the Senate.

Drivers killed 

LIMA. Peru (AP) - 
Two young Peruvian stock car drivers, Javier 
Swayne and Akira Gu- shiken, were killed Fri­ day when their car hit a sandbank and plunged into the Pacific Ocean during the Presidente de la Republica Grand Prix race from Lima to Are- quipa. 

The two had completed 
467 of the 591 miles when they apparently skidded on sand and lost control of their BMW. 

Tire new spaper “ El 
Comercio” of Lima said fishermen near the town of Atico tried to rescue the BMW drivers, who had plunged over a 
32o-foot embankment in­ to the sea. They succeed­ ed only in recovering the bodies. 

Peter Rube, in a Dat­ sun, won the Lima-Are- quipa run in 6 hours IO minutes with an average speed of 96 m iles an hour. 

 ch a irm a n , 
Henry 
M. 
Jackson (D.Wash.) of the 
Senate 
E nergy Com ­ m ittee, has repeatedly expressed reservations about the gasoline tax, pointing out that the 5o per cent increase in ga­ soline prices over the last 
3 years has not cut con­ sumption and saying, “ A gas tax won’t get you an­ ywhere.” 
Controversy 
On the House side. 
Rep. Thomas L. Ashley 
(D-Ohio), who heads the new ad hoc committee on energy, says the gasoline tax is the most ‘‘highly controversial” part of the 
Carter package. 
Rep. Al Ullman (D- 
O re), chairm an of the 
House Ways and Means 
Committee, said Friday, 
“ We will he looking at other ways to do the sam e th in g.” U llm an’s effort to pass a 2o-cent gas tax two years ago was crushed on the House floor. vSome adm inistration officials say in private that the gasoline tax is 
“ symbolic,” even though 
Carter has publicity as­ serted otherwise. 
Acknowledging that the savings would be only about 4 per cent of con­ sum ption by 1985, one senior administration of­ ficial said, “ there is a temptation to say it’s a sm all num ber, but it really misses the point. , 
. this is a test of how deeply we have to bite the bullet.” 
Gas guzzlers 
Carter’s top energy ad­ viser, Ja m e s R. Sehle- singer, says that the ga­ soline tax will also spur an early retirem ent of m any of the 
“ gas g uzzlers” produced by 
A m erican auto m akers during the late 196os and early 197os. 
Fuel economy of new 
American cars actually dropped from 17 or 18 miles per gallon in 1965 to 13 miles per gallon in 
1974. 
A num ber of leading econom ists, including 
H arvard 
P ro fessor 
J a m e s Osten and H en­ drick, say the tax might save only about 3oo,ooo 

 barrels a day in gasoline by 1985. 
Houthakker, in a phone interview, said that the gasoline savings from 
Carter’s standby tax “ is not a major impact — but still not negligible.” 
Osten, a senior econo­ mist for Data Resources, 
Inc., a private consulting firm headed by Otto 
EckvStein, said he expects 

 gasoline demand to peak in the early 198os without the gasoline tax. 
The major reasons for expecting a leveling of gasoline demand, Osten says, is the introduction of m ore fuel efficient diesel autos and the in­ creases in auto efficiency required by the 1975 
Energy Policy and Con­ servation Act.

Government Of The Beode, 
By Tile People, and for Tile reopl 
(except in the case of Saccharin) 

The majority of American people disapprove of the proposed ban on saccharin. A recent Louis Harris sur­ vey confirms it. 
However, the LLS. Government's Food and Drug 
Administration intends to ban saccharin in foods, bev­ erages, and all other products.To soften the blow and quiet the voice of protest, the FDA announced it would consider allowing saccharin to be sold over the counter as a drug. But... mSNOTCEKIAIN 
YOU WI LL BE ABLE TO BUY SACCHARIN 
OVERTHE COUNTER. 
Frankly, the FDA action is confusing and there is a catch. 
Weigh carefully the statement by Donald Kennedy, 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration: 
"I want to make it clear that permanent approval of sac­ charin for drug use is not automatic.' 
To run the drug tests the FDA would require 
"5 years at a minimum" states Dr. Leonard Haimes, 
President of the American Society of Bariatric 
Physicians. 
The fact is, saccharin is not a typical drug since its sole function is to provide sweetness without calories. 
Thus, saccharin may not be as easy to buy as you've been led to believe. 
SACCHARIN IS BEING BANNED 
ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. 
T ile FO A is basing its proposed ban chiefly on the re­ sults of a single unfinished Canadian test of 2oo rats that were fed the human equivalent of over 1,25o twelve ounce beverages a day over a lifetime. Quite frankly 
1 there is considerable scientific disagreement over tliis test's validity due to the "mega-doses" of saccharin fed to these rats. 
On the other hand, and what you may not know, the large body of existing research does not indicate that saccharin causes cancer in animals or humans. There have been at least a dozen experiments on animals conducted over the last decade, which the National 
Academy of Sciences reviewed, and they concluded 

 that no regulatory action against saccharin was indicated. 
M ore importantly, there have been at least six studies involving a large number of humans (more than 
6o,ooo) with no evidence that heavy saccharin ingestion results in an increase in bladder cancer. 
O f course, the most rigorous "test" could well be the fact that saccharin lias been in use for over 8o years without a single case of cancer attributed to it. 
If any cancer danger is demonstrated from diet foods and beverages containing saccharin, everyone agrees that they should be taken off the shelves. But, at this point, there appears to be a lot of confusion, con­ troversy and insufficient evidence to ban saccharin. And more time to sort it all out seems justified. 
THERE IS NOSUBSTriUTE 
FoRSACCHARIN AVAILABLE 

Many people are under the mistaken impression that 
American industry has a substitute waiting in the wings, ready to go as soon as the saccharin ban goes into effect. 
This is totally untrue. 
"No other alternate sweepier is far enough along 
...there is nothing around the comer next year to look forward to" according to FDA Deputy Commissioner 
Sherwin Gardner.This means that if saccharin is banned, millions of diabetics may not experience the taste of sweetness for a long time, perhaps ever, in their diet foods and soft drinks. And millions of weight-conscious 
Americans will have to forego the benefits of low calorie sweetened soft drinks, candy gum, and desserts. 
WHAT CONGRESS DOES WILL DEPEND ON YOU. 

Both Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative 
Paul Rogers have suggested that a thorough scientific review should take place. Independent scientists should judge the data on saccharin and especially the validity of the Canadian experiment as it relates to humans. 
We think this is a sensible and essential suggestion and we urge you to urge Congress to support that pro­ posal and provide the time necessary to judge all the data. 
Without your support, the ban on saccharin will become a reality well all have to live with.

Below you'll find a list of government leaders who have a special interest in the proposed ban on saccharin. Phone * them! write them,- and do it before May 18. That's the date the FDA puts saccharin on trial in a public hearing. Let | them know you support postponement of a ban so an independent and thorough scientific review can be made to m evaluate the total evidence on saccharin.

F o r those who like country living, are equestrians at heart or have an affinity for sports such as golf, s w im m in g and tennis, they’ve got it all at Fair 
Oaks. 
Fair Oaks, just 15 miles north of N.VV. 
Loop 41o in San Antonio, features 5,ooo acres of spectacular H ill Country acreage now being offered by the Don 
Smith Co. 

Ideal homesites 
One- to 15-acre tracts spanning the rolling hills of the former ranch in three counties — Bexar Kendall and 
Comal — make ideal homesites for those seeking the quiet beauty of the country. 
The Don Smith Co. has been extre­ mely careful in the development of 
Fair Oaks in an effort to retain all the natural surroundings while still pro­ 

 viding the amenities required by mo­ dern life styles. 
Wide, paved streets wind through the area to the heavily wooded home­ sites. There is an excellent selection of hilltop, as well as valley, locations. 
City-tvpe utilities have been provided. 
Those who choose the serene life of­ fered at Fair Oaks will find a variety of activities close at hand. The Fair Oaks 
Racquet and Swim Club has eight brand new tennis courts and a large swimming pool surrounded by mani­ cured lawns and great oaks. A rustic clubhouse, newly renovated, features a 
Pro Shop, social area, dressing and shower facilities convenient to the ten­ nis courts and pool area. An official grand opening is planned for May 14. 
One of the most exciting features of 
Fair Oaks is the championship-quality golf course now under way. The ti.756-yard course, designed by Gary 
Player and Ron Kirby of Kirby/Plaver 

 and Associates, Golf Course A rchi­ tects, will offer some of the finest fea­ tures of famous golf courses through­ out the United States, with three to five multi-level tee positions on most holes, undulating greens and fairway sand bunkers. 

There are a number of homes avai­ lable for viewing, all offered by a var­ iety of fine builders in Fair Oaks. The homes have been specially designed to take advantage of the prime tract lo­ cations. 

Fair Oaks is easily accessible from 
N.W. Ill IO and just a short driving distance to UTSA. USAA, the South 
Texas Medical Center, major shopping malls and entertainment in northwes­ tern San Antonio. 

To reach Fair Oaks, drive north on 
N.VV. IU IO to the Tarpon Road exit and watch for the Fair Oaks temporary sales office. 

SKY HARBOUR com m unity Qf hom es by Ray Ellison features ‘S to reyw o o d ’ m o d el 
Ray Ellison premieres 
Sky Harbour community 

FAIR OAKS, set in the site of the fo rm e r Fair Ranch, offers w ooded hom esites now 

One of the most exciting con­ cepts in new homes ever to be unveiled in southwestern San 
Antonio will open this weekend with Grand Opening festivities highlighted by hourly drawings for free gifts. 
The event is the Grand Opening of the long awaited Sky Harbour com­ munity of homes by Ray Ellison. 

Sweeping view 

Nestled on rolling hillsides with panoramic, sweeping views of the surrounding countryside. Sky Harbour is a distinctive com munity of fine homes, from the dram atic en­ tranceway on Pearsall Road to the lo­ vely, winding roads and cul-de-sacs bearing such seafaring names as 
“ M ariner,” “ Sail Loft” and “ Port- side.” 
Although the star attraction of the grand opening will be the array of new designs and exteriors presented for the first time in Sky Harbour, families will, undoubtedly, enjoy the nickel hot dogs and nickel cokes offered as a nostalgic throwback lo the “ good old days.” 
And the “ good old days” theme is fittin g for Sky Harbour, where the price range for new homes goes from 
$28,ooo to $35,ooo, with outstanding 

 quality and attractiveness one expects to find only in a much higher priced home. 
Designs range from three- and four-bedroom, two-bath beauties fea­ turing spacious two-car garages — all w ith the exclusive E llison energy package featuring extra insulation in walls and ceiling, interlocking thre­ sholds and special caulking plus power attic ventilators and custom-designed central a ir and heating systems, which, all together, pack a tremendous energy-saving punch. 

Plan a pleasant weekend visit to Sky 
Harbour’s Grand Opening celebration today. Register for hourly drawings for free toy sailboats and (’orningware sets; enjoy the nickel hot dogs and cokes; let the kiddies enjoy helium- filled balloons. Best of all, for yourself and your family, discover a new life style and a fresh concept in new homes for southwestern San Antonio. 
If you’re driving south on SYV. Loop 
411), exit on Pearsall Road (FM 2536) and, in a few moments, you’ll see the distinctive Sky Harbour entrancewav.

Woodbridge Phase Ii holds grand opening 

Woodbridge, where leisurely lifes styles thought impossible by many become enjoyable rea­ lities at affordable prices, is holding a Grand Opening for its 
Phase II this weekend. 
On the p rem ises of these stately townhouses is a recreational package ca re fu lly planned to give y ears of pleasure to 
Woodbridge residents. 
Leisure is plentiful here, for residents never need to worry about mainten­ ance of their townhomes or their s e ­ curity. 
Joyful discovery 
Woodbridge, 31o2 and 31o3 Eisen- hauer Rd., already has been the joyful discovery of numerous San Antonians. 
In fact, its first phase, on the south 

 side of Eisenhauer Road, is almost sold out. This, however, is the adult- oriented part of Woodbridge. 
Two lighted, acrylic-surfaced tennis courts, two swimming pools, two club­ houses and a picnic garden area make 
Woodbridge more than ju st a home address. It’s a total environment, per­ fect for active life styles of profession­ als or those who want the most out of retirement. 
One clu b h ou se fe a tu re s a party room, kitchen and gam e room; the other, a sundeck, ping-pong table and firepit for cookouts. 
All this is for the exclusive enjoy­ m ent of Woodbridge resid ents and their guests. 
The in te rio rs of the W oodbridge townhouses are visually exciting by their “ open” design accomplished by broad window expanses, handsome 

 fireplaces and lavish finishing touches. 
E xtra large 17- by 24-foot m aster bedrooms are common at Woodbridge. 
So are fashionable com partm ented baths. One of the Woodbridge plans has two compartmented baths off the same bedroom — one for him, another for her. Larger units have 3Vfe baths. 
All Woodbridge townhouses have at least 2% baths, each stunningly fin­ ished with hand-antiqued cab in ets, rich coordinated wallpaper and large lighted mirrors. Each townhome also has a fireplace and a balcony. 
Three models range in size from 
1,75o to 2,7oo sq. ft. The buyer has a choice of a two-car carport or a totally enclosed garage. 
Buyers also are given their choices in selecting colors for the attractive interiors of their townhomes. They can select floor covering, wallpaper and

The k itch e n s, too, are unusually a ttra ctiv e and fully equipped with top-name appliances. They feature an exceptional amount of storage, plus a built-in planning desk, complete with drawers. 

Energy-saving features are common to Woodbridge townhomes, too. The cost of operating utilities is lessened substantially by eight inches of solid 

 insulation inside the outside walls; w eatherstripping on outside doors; bronze, solar-paned glass; all-electric appliances; and separate heating and air conditioning systems.

They’re also close to the business and professional centers of the North Side, 
Alamo Heights and downtown. 

Security of all residences is deter­ mined not only by limited access to the project’s premises but also a highly trained, 24-hour secu rity patrol on guard seven days a week. 
Woodbridge Townhomes are priced from as low as $47,5oo to $8o,ooo. 
The project is reached most easily by exiting from N.W. Loop 41o to Harry

Rusticity, splendor make Fair Oaks ideal 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS-— Sunday May I 1977 

If ever you had the in­ clination to own a piece of land, now is the time to make that dream a reali­ ty. Some of the most beautiful Hill Country land available is just north of San Antonio at 
Fair Oaks. 
Steeped in recent his­ tory as a thoroughbred race horse and cattle ranch, Fair Oaks has been carefully developed by the Don Smith Co. into one- to 15-acre tracts that provide dramatic, oak- covered homesites that can be purchased and built on now or later. 

Wide paved streets through the area have been named after the fa­ mous race horses and tracks of the world, and there are miles and miles of riding trails for equestrians. 
Amenities 
Recreational facilities abound at Fair Oaks. The 
Fair Oaks Racquet and 
Swim Club offers eight tennis courts, a practice court and a super size swimming pool sur­ rounded by rollowing lawns and great oak trees. 

A clubhouse, wdth Fro 
Shop and dressing faci­ lities, is adjacent to the pool and courts. Profes­ sional tennis instruction w ill be provided by Mike 
Moore, in cooperation with B ill O’Bryant of 
McFarlin Tennis Center. 

Golfers have not been forgotten at Fair Oaks. 
At the very heart of the development is a cham­ pionship - quality golf course now under con­ struction. The course, designed by professional golfer Gary Player and 

Ron Kirby of Kirby / 
Player & Associates, Golf 
Course Architects* will feature a 
6,75fi-vard course that traverses the undulating terrain of 
Fair Oaks as one that will offer sufficient challenge for highly experienced players and average players alike. 

Fair Oaks offers a life in the country yet pro­ vides the conveniences of city - type utilities and ready access to N. W. Ill 
IO for commuting to San 
Antonio. It is just a short driving distance to UT-

San Antonio EXPRESS-N EW S— Sunday M ay I 1977 

Burns Co. building to ‘save 

Ifs not i*vpi i open yet, but the Michael Billings­ ley family is taking no chances with their new homesite in Royal Ridge 
The fam ily got the jump on San Antonio to he the “ first family" in town to select a new home location in the 
Burns Co. portion of the development. The firm is yet to open its new area. 
By June 

The 128-tract portion, scheduled to begin con­ struction in April with new homes ready for oc­ cupancy in June, peace­ fully sits among the wooded rolling hills of northeastern 
Bexar 
('aunty. The roads, as yet unpaved, gently sweep through the area, follow­ ing the natural contours of the land to preserve as much of the natural setting as possible. Hill­ top sites offer a splendid view of the San Antonio skyline by day; a twin­ kling array of distant city lights by night. th is quiet, spacious countryside setting was just what Diane Billings­ ley wanted for the chil­ dren. She added that the location is minutes away from tin* family’s place of worship; her hus­ band’s position at Fort 
Sam Houston; excellent schools for Scott and Re­ becca; and major shop­ ping malls and enter­ tainment facilities for the whole family. 
The Billingsley family came to San Antonio from West Point only three months ago when 
Michael accepted a resi­ 

 dency in oral surgery at 
Brooke Army Medical 
Center. The whole family fell in love with the cli­ mate and friendliness of the Alamo City, and they decided to make this their permanent home. 
Rather than rent. Mi­ chael and Diane knew the advantages of invest­ ing in home ownership. 
And after shopping over 
San 
Antonio’s home­ builders, they chose the 
Burns Co. to build their first home. 
Why 
Burns? 
Their commitment to energy conservation, say M i­ chael arid Diane. 

Every Burns Co. home is built with the proven 
“ Power Saver’’ eon* struction techniques to drastically reduce the major cause of increased utility bills; air infiltra­ tion. 

'rii<' Burns Co. seals every home during se­ veral stages of construc­ tion to elim inate the unnecessary flow of air into or out of your home 
— flow which tests have proven to account for 41 per cent of heating and cooling costs. Extra in­ sulation, double glass windows and power ven­ tilators are all standard. 
The “ Power Saver” collection features excit­ ing options in design and si/c to meet tilt* needs of any family or lifestyle. 
The Billingsleys have just about settled on one plan, and having so many to choose from en­ abled them to get just what they dreamed of

 all prospective ho­ meowners to see the ad­ vantages of owning a 
‘‘Power Saver" home iii

 offices are open daily, except Wednesdays, in 
The Great Northwest, north of NAV. Loop 41o on Culehra Road to PM

Thunderbird Hills, an established community in northwestern San 
Antonio’s quadrant within loop 41o, is showing this three-bedroom, two-bath and two-car garage home at 21 34 James Bonham Dr. Built by W . R. Craig Co. and priced at only $29,9oo, the house features a 
Magic Chef range and oven with a black glass door and vent hood, carpeting throughout and a homesite with a view of the downtown skyline. Thunderbird Hills is convenient to numerous shopping facilities, including the Ingram Mall now under way, and Northside 
District schools. It is reached most easily by exiting from N .W . loop 
41o onto Ingram Road, proceeding inside the Loop to Oak Hills Road and following Open House signs inside the area. 
‘Buy now’ advice beats inflation during long wait 

During the next de­ cade, new homes will cost inure; homeowners will spend more money repairing and rehabili­ tating existing homes; and the demand for mortgage money will ra­ pidly increase. 

That’s the opinion of 
Professor Sherman J. 
Maisel of the University of California, Berkeley. writing in a recent issue of the Mortgage Guaran­ ty 
Insurance 
Corp. 
(MGIC) Newsletter. 
Maisel, a co - director 

 of the National Bureau of 
Economic Research - 
West and former member of the Federal 
Reserve Board of Gover­ nors, said the total number of new housing starts and mobile home shipments in the next decade will reach record peaks, surpassing the record years of 1972 * 74. 
He noted the cost and availability of credit will lie major factors deter­ mining residential con­ struction expenditures. 
Maisel said that, by 
1985, he expects real 

CLASSIFIED DISPLAT 
CLASSIFIED DISPLAY 

 household income to in­ crease by 2o per cont. 
Investment per dwelling unit will rise about 15 per cent. As a result, expen­ ditures on new residen­ tial dwelling units are expected to rise from 
$43.1 billion (in 1972 dol­ lars) to an annual aver­ age of $52.o billion bv 
1985. 
What about the future cost of housing? A great deal will depend upon tin1 rate of inflation in the next decade. Dr. Donald ll. Sauer said that, be­ cause of inflation, the cost of housing in the next IO years may be shocking. Sauer is pro­ fessor of finance at In­ diana University and serves as consulting edi­ tor for the MGIC News­ letter, 
Using M aisel’s esti­ mate of a 5 per cent rate of inflation, Sauer said a 
84o,ooo home today would cost $o5,155 in 1987. At a 
7 per cent rate of infla­ tion, that same $4o,ooo home would cost $78,68o in IO years. 
With a IO per cent down payment and a 9 per cent interest rate on a $4o,ooo home today, the buyer’s monthly mort­ gage payment would be approximately $29o. But to finance the same home 
IO years from now at a 5 per cent rate of inflation, the buyer's monthly payment would be $472; if the inflation rate runs at 7 per cent, $57o. 
Maisel said the actual amount spent for resi­ dential construction and the amount of financing required will depend as much on the degree of price inflation as on the level of real output. 
It will be imperative that inflation be held in check, not only to hold down the cost of con­ struction and home ow­ nership costs such as property taxes and in­ surance premiums but also to reduce the* infla­ tion premium in long - term interest rates, he concluded.

This New Home 
Costs Less Than 
Your Old Home. 

I’m Buddy Burns. And I d Uke to shed sonic licht on your old home. If your home is 
5 years old or older, chances are it's obsolete. 
That s right. obsolete. Be- canseai the tune your home vs .is built, there were virtually no energy -effi­ ciency standards. As a result, many San Antonians are laced with utility hills that may soon exceed their house payments! 

Why NOW Is The Time To Buy. 
Let s look at the tacts. Since von invested in your home a lew vcars ago, two things have hap­ pened. For one. you've been making house p a y m e n ts tor sev­ eral years, so your etp/ifv has grown. Too, since the cost of building a new home has stead­ ily increased, the cost of rephn mg your home has increased 
BUT, because your old home isn't energy efficient, it wastes valuable energy. And believe it or not, homeowners around the country are actually beginning to lase money when they sell their older homes. Because no­ 

 body wants to buy a home where the cost of heating and cooling exceeds the monthly payments. 
My advice is this: With the money you can make by selling your old home right now, you can probably make the dawn- payment and move int a a new 
Burns Co Pawer Saver" home tinkle. And, while your house payments max be a little higher, the lower utility hills should easily offset the difference The only thing you i an't afford to do is wait much longer. 

 ing and cabinetry, and wood- burning fireplaces. Big, bright 
"wife saver" kitchens, witn 
General Electric appliances and plenty of cabinet storage. Luxu­ rious baths with marble vanities and full size tubs And elegant master suites, with walk in closets and separate dressing areas. Priced from $46,ooo to 
$65,ooo. For additional informa­ tion, call the area sales office 
(see map), or your realtor. Re member, the longer you wait the more you stand to lose.

Spring area 

Green Spring Valley, an exciting new subdi- xision just north of the 
San Antonio city limito, offers homeowners a un­ ique living environment in a natural community carefully planned. 
Subdivision planners were able to preserve much of the natural beauty of the area, and the subdivision’s pro­ gressive design has used the area’s terrain to create natural recrea­ tional facilities for ho­ meowners. 
Green belt 
Green Spring Valley residents can enjoy their own natural park. The site of this park is a 
3o-acre green belt deeded to homeowners. Nature trails wind through a heavily wooded section of this belt. Huge, old oaks line the trails. These trees and und the under­ growth have been left in their natural state. 
The green belt also in­ cludes a picnic area, complete with tables, and a grassy meadow with a football grid. Parents xviii be glad children can reach the park without crossing any major streets. 
The subdivision's swimming pool and ten­ nis courts also have been built with the landscape in mind. Tall oak trees shade the swimming ar­ ea. complete with a wa­ 

 terfall, rock-Iilied walk­ ways and an island in the middle of the pool. Green 
Spring 
V alley ho­ meowners can play on three professional si/e tennis courts, but no chain link fence mars the horizon. Nylon nets keep the balls in without blocking the view. A party cabana, made of rock and redwood in con­ temporary styling, offers residents full party faci­ lities. 
The subdivision has been designed for maxi­ mal safety and conven­ ience. The street layout minimizes traffic flow for greater safety, and security guards patrol the area nightly. Land has been set aside on the perim eters of Green 
Spring Valley for com­ mercial use and soon will provide residents with convenience stores and similar facilities.

Great den, 
Neal Eubanks! 

D on't bt* surprised if someone tells you how treat your Great America nome looks. Because at 
Great America, we believe you can see the difference quality makes. 
In our garden kitchens, with handfinished cabinets and top quality appliances. In our roomy living areas, with vaulted cathedral ceilings, built-in bookcases and woodburn- ing fireplaces. In our lavish ceramic tile baths, with marble vanities and decorator appointments. 
Even in our generous mas­ ter suites, with private baths and walk-in closets. 
Everywhere you look, there is careful attention to design, styling, practi­ cality and encrgy-efff- ciency. 
But that's only the in­ side story. Outside, Great 
America homes are strik­ ingly individualistic. Each home is designed for its particular homesite. Some are traditional, others reflect the informality of 
California styling. Some have soaring rooflines, 

 cedar trim and second- story balconies. Others are simple, yet elegant. 
But all are equally suited to entertaining and day- to-day family living. 
You'll find these really great homes in San 
Antonio's finest com­ munities. In Northwest 
San Antonio, we have new homes in Park Forest,

SOLAR hom e, built by Com al Solar H om es, in Talism an Estates 
Solar I Home debuts near New Braunfels 

How far in the future is the self-sufficient, solar- powered home? 
The answer is that it no longer is in the future. It has arrived, in part at least, in 
Talism an 
Estates near New Braun­ fels, where Comal Solar 
Homes is introducing the 
Solar I Home. 
Prepared 

This home, engineered by G. F. Gorman of Co­ mal Solar Homes, is, by builder’s choice, not fully powered by the sun. But , by the buyer’s choice, it can be converted to full, self-sufficient solar power even without structural alterations. It was built to suit the buyer’s desires. 

As it is now, this spa­ cious, all-brick home containing 1,65o sq. ft. of living area plus a HOO sq. ft. double garage can house a fam ily of five who would pay less than l/u of normal utility costs! 
Nothing experimental was used to achieve this modern-day wonder. 
Everything it features has been tested success­ fully in other parts of the country. And it’s offered at a modest price: 
$55,ooo. 
The home operates with solar power on all but light fixtures, range, oven and the buyer’s re­ frigerator. Most so-called 
“ solar-assisted” homes use the sun’s power for only the water heating system, but, with this home, 
Comal 
Solar 
Homes has gone far beyond that and assures the buyer that he or she can opt for more to the point of full solar power throughout the home. 
Normal utilities are available as a back-up system. 
Bul the quantity of so­ lar power is not all this energy-saving home fea­ tures. Tho Solar Home I mav draw from the sun’s 

 unlimited power, but Co­ mal Solar Homes is con­ cerned with helping 
Mother Nature do her thing with the greatest of ease by providing her with the best man-made insulative products. 
Special insulation here is added to standard in­ sulation, i.e., one-inch lira thane wrapped with asphalt. This feature goes not only into walls and ceilings hut even se­ parates the home from its firm, reinforced foun­ dation! The home is di­ vided into three sections, each insulated separately from one another for hampering cold, heat and even sound. 
Placement and kinds of windows also add to the e ne rgy-saving d ev i ees this home boasts. There actually are two separate window systems —- out­ side, solar gray windows are sealed into structure to prevent infiltration of unwanted air, yet they earl be opened for fresh air. They are arranged in a hot-cold opposing man­ ner to maintain air flow. 

The home also has special steel-encased doors which also feature uralhane and seal tightly when closes. 
Even the fireplace of this home helps Mother 
Nature do her thing for the family. It is designed to use outside air for combustion of wood, and even that is controllable as it was with the effi­ cient cookstove used in 
(he past. Ecology enters the picture with the out­ side ash dump. Heatila- tors, normally powered, in the fireplace utilize power fans to move addi­ tional warm air through the house; a glass fire screen seals when closed; and the opening at its chimney prevents con­ densation build-up. 
There’s more for 
Mother 
Nature: new 
Kohler water-saving 

 plumbing is used for the 
12o-gallon hot water tank unit with two small pumps which, together, use less energy than two 
1oo-watt light bulbs. 'Phis unit is guaranteed for five years, but, under normal usage, could last for another 15. Note, too, that hot water healers, even under normal fami­ ly usage, constitute about 
2o per cent of what ap­ pears on a monthly elec­ tric bill. 
The attic ventilators are thermostatically con­ trolled to prevent heat build-up in the Summer and have eave vents to provide free flow of air. 
The air conditioning system here is more than ample for the entire liv­ ing area of the home. It’s a 1M»-Ion unit with 18,726 
BTUs. 
The Solar I system is engineered for today and the future. The following contractors contributed a major effort in the con­ struction of 
(his 
‘4breaklh rough” home: 
Paul Crawford (New 
Braunfels), special foun­ dations; 
Robert Bigge, special fram ing; Don 
Bolt Insulation Co., spe­ cial insulation and vapor 

 barrier insulation; Cole­ man Electric Co., special electric w iring and power controls; Manx Decorat­ ing Center, color coor­ dination; Williams Heat­ ing and Air Conditioning, economy-designed heat­ ing and air condi­ tioning; Voges Plumbing 
Co., special plumbing make up and solar in­ stallation by distributors of Solatron Solar Panels and 
Equipm ent; and 
Aleneo, special windows. 
Realtor is Easy Hall 
Realty, New Braunfels. 
The home, quite 
Conventional in its ap­ pearance, does prove that a solar-fueled home need not be an architectural monstrosity for the sake of lower utility bills. In fact, it can even be as handsome as this one. 

Talism an Estates is reached most easily by exiting from N E. Ill 35 onto Walnut (Hwy. 46 
N .E.), proceeding north 
HG} miles, turning right onto Bear Creek Road, right again where Talis­ man 
Estates sign is seen, right onto Talisman 
Road itself and then left to Amulet and the new 
Solar I Home.

Quality built elegance and dynamic styling add up to the “ personality - plus” G reat Am erica homes now creating so much excitement among home buyers in San An­ tonio. 
Every turn of the cor­ ridor and every room of the home surprises the visitor with refreshing and exciting features. 
Panoramic 
Enter a Great America home to the breathtaking panoramic view of a spa­ cious living area with brick-crafted fireplaces and soaring ceilings which may extend beyond second-story liv­ ing areas or indoor bal­ conies. Generous panels of glass merge the envir­ onment and the home in­ to one airy, open living concept 
Natural utilization of space by Great Am eri­ ca’s designers eliminates the four-walled, closed-in feeling of conventional bousing. Instead, a Great 
America home may conter life around an en­ ormous family living ar­ ea adjacent to the break­ fast nook and kitchen and with easy access to out­ door patios, pools and garden landscaping. 
Formal living and din­ ing areas — many with built-in buffets, cabinets and glass-doored upper cabinets for display — lie to the opposite side of the kitchen, creating a com­ plete walk-through serv­ ing area perfect for home entertaining. 
This unstructured feeling of extended living space is found among the bedrooms and master suite, all tucked away from traffic areas for privacy. 
Many have sloped ceilings, glass- paneled walls and indoor or outdoor balconies overlooking great views or living areas below. 
Master suite plans exa­ mine the alternatives to the dark and crowded baths common to most homes with separate his-n-her dressing areas, vanities and walk-in clo­ sets connected by a sun­ ken Roman tub. Other plans combine patio and sitting areas in the mas­ ter suite. 
You w ill find Great 
America homes in San 
Antonio’s finest com­ munities. In the north­ west, new Great America homes are available in the countryside setting of 
Park Forest, off Lock- hill-Selma Road north of

Many opt for Solar 
‘screening’ 

Solar Screens Inc., 817 
E. Euclid St., is receiv­ ing a large number of orders from San Anton­ ians who anticipate much higher utility bills during the hot summer months just ahead. 
Reports that an ex­ pected longer, hotter summer could cause uti­ lity bills to increase 39 per cent over what they were' last summer have prompted many to take advantage of the en­ ergy-saving features of­ fered by Solar Screens. 

Solar rays 

Solar Screens block the solar rays before they penetrate the window glass, thereby eliminat­ ing heat build-up in the house. Cooling and heat­ ing equipment operate more efficiently, then, and provide lower energy costs and more comfortable interiors.

Solar Screens are a woven fiberglass mesh coated with a tough vinyl jacket. They will not dent, crease, stretch or ravel. They are imper vious to rust, corrosion, salt air, smoke and other atmospheric contamin­ ants. Even insects are screened out. 
These special screens are made by a well known manufacturer and are guaranteed for IO years. Under normal usage, however, these screens have an unlimit­ ed life expectancy. Each is custom made for its specific dimensions and requirements. 
Homeowners are inter­ ested in the overall ap pearance of their home; so, they know Solar 
Screens can be installed outside or inside the house. 
Since these screens are customized, there is almost no limit to the variety of window designs on which they can be placed. 
With Solar Screens, a homeowner can choose a color that will harmonize with both the exterior and interior design of the home. Choices can be made from charcoal, black, bronze or grey. 
Solar Screens not only control solar heat;'they also control sunlight and privacy and can prevent glare and fading of dra­ peries and the like. 
Solar Screens are re­ ceiving wide acclaim all over the country for real protection from solar rays, for durability and ease of maintenance and for attractiveness. As well, they are proven to save as much as 3o per cent monthly on energy costs.

Forum to pan for gold at the 
Palace 

— B y--------------------------------- 
EVE LYNN SAWYER 

“ An Evening at the Pa­ lace” will be held at the 
Lutcher Center at 7 p.m. Sa­ turday, May 14, as the South­ west Foundation 
Forum’s black tie gala. 

This annual fund-raising party will in c lu d e “ d iv e rs e a m u s e ­ m e n ts,“ a “ sum ptuous repast” and “ terpsichorean delights” ac­ cording to the turn of the century invitation. 
The grounds of the Lutcher es­ tate will sim ulate the Crystal P a­ lace Saloon in a gold-rush mining town. The event will include ladies on swings, p ris m c h a n d e lie rs hanging from trees, and dances beneath the crystal dom e in the center of the Palace Court dining room. 
Hours were spent by local artists painting th eatrical backdrops to depict the era. Transporting gold dust on a Wells Fargo stagecoach or entertaining like the ‘‘Unsinka­ ble Molly Brown” w ill all be part of the decorations. 
Project 

Funds derived from the gala will go to the F orum 's current project, 
“ Hormones and the Predisposition to Breast C ancer,” under the dir­ ection of Dr. Joseph Goldzieher. 
Last year’s gala provided $25,ooo for this project. Guest su b scrip ­ tions for the 1977 gala are $1oo per couple with sponsors’ tickets $125 a couple. 
Mrs. Ja m es Lavender 111 is pre­ sident of the Forum . Mrs. Donald 
Krause and Mrs. differed E. Mor­ ton are co-chairm en of the spon­ sors. 
Mrs. E rnest S. Felibaum and

Debunking myths 

What do former Mayor Walter l l . McAllister. Ellis 
Presley and Col. Charles A. Lindbergh have in common? 
AU u ere raised as only children. In this four-part series. 
Patricia U idioms explores the myth o f the only child and says that contrary to old idl es tales. the child a ho grows up solo is apt to be hiving and giving and a high achiever to hoot. 

ELVIS PRESLEY 

 in d e p e n d e n ce an d tr u s tw o r th i­ ness.” 
The best of both worlds? 
Sure, sure — only children do great on tests, but what about real life? They are a hit there, too. The num ber of only children in the ranks of the em inent is truly im­ pressive. 
Leaders 
The famous study, “Cradles of 
Eminence,” by Victor and Mildred 
Goertzel, finds a high percentage of single children am ong their 4oo super-successful adults. 
Also, only children turn up iii disproportionately high numbers in such directories of high achievers as “ Who’s Who in America,” in lists of doctors, astronauts aud scientists. 
The course of history has been changed by single children. In 
World War IL two of the Big Three winning nations were led by single children — United States President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and R ussia’s 
Premier Joseph Stalin. 
We have d a y d r e a m e d of th e

 and are lacking now. In contrast, researchers have been piling up statistics in the only child’s favor. 
Studies show that the only child tends to advance more rapidly in language development; racks up s u p e rio r sc o re s in in te lle c tu a l achievem ent; is generally more aggressive and ambitious. 
Only ch ild ren a re o v e r-re p re ­ sented (in term s of their ratio in the population as a whole) among stu­ dents in professional schools and iii colleges and universities with high entrance requirements. 

First in a series 

Toni Kalbo, herself un only child w ho was “ peeved” wit Ii the put down cliches, reported in Psycho­ logy Today: ‘‘I found that only children are a unique combination of traits typical of first-born chil­ dren. such as high intelligence and achievement motivation, and some good traits of last-borns, such as 

- B y ---------------------------- 

PATRICIA WILLIAMS 

You have one child. Maybe you planned on no children or eight or some number in between, but something did or did not happen and you have one. You have an only child. 
C o n trary to old w iv es’ tales, that’s okay. In fact, there is a con­ siderable body of evidence to indi­ cate that it s more than just okay. 
The only child is a very fortunate child in many ways — and so are the only child’s parents. 
As inflation swells, birth control methods become ever m ore effec­ tive. the divorce rate clim bs and women continue to en ter the job m ark et, m ore and m ore couples will opt for having only one child. 
Although the world is becoming a crowded place, with a shoulder- to-shoulder total of 4 billion people in 1976, Americans are below zero population level with a fertility rate of 1.8 children per woman. 
And with good reason. 
About half the women in Am eri­ ca are now working; nonetheless, the m edian household incom e in 
1975 was $14,911, according to the 
M arketing Economics Institute — and it has been estim ated that it takes over $2o,o9o a year for a fa­ mily of four to m ain tain a high standard of living. 
Pressures 
Even more significant, some ex­ perts now estimate that the cost of raising a child can easily approac h 
$75,ooo. Others, such as the Com­ mission on Population Growth and the American Future, place the fi­ gure as high as $1oo,ooo from crib through college and post-graduate training. 
These are forceful reasons for opting to have only one child, but are they really stro n g enough? 
What about just one more? Friends and family often urge parents of an only child to have another “ to keep the little one com pany.” Not only 

 w. w. M c A llis te r s r . 

 does this place undeserved guilt on the parents, it lacks any basis in common sense. 
Each child should be wanted for itself as a separate and beloved human being, not as an accessory for the first child, lf there is no b etter reason to have a second child than lo provide com pany, 
“ som eone to play w ith ,” d o n ’t have it. 
Al one time, being an only child seemed only a shade above being a plague carrier. In fact, back in 
19o7. estee m ed psychologist G. 
Stanley Hall pontificated, “ Being an only child is a d ise a se in itself” —an outlook that held sway for many years, though not with­ out challengers. 
Leta S. Hollingworth, the noted clinical psychologist, took a firm stand in 1916 when she wrote, “ A... bugaboo is that if a child is reared alone, without brothers and sisters, he will grow up selfish, egotistic and an undesirable citizen. Figures are, however, so far lacking to show the disastrous consequences of be­ ing an only child.” 
Such figures were lacking then

 created these strapless silhouettes. 
They’re m ade of im ported cot­ tons or cotton blen d s, and the 
32-year-old "E astern er” has given definite shapes to the “ nothing” dresses. 
"T h ey’re unconstructed; there's no tailoring,” says Kathleen, who designed clothes for her shop in 
Acapulco, 
P aisa’s 
Super 
Bou­ tique, before com ing back to the 
States.

A native of New Jersey who has become addicted to the Southwest, 
Kathleen began her career in the fashion departm ent of the buying office of May Department Stores in 
New York. 
The petite designer never m akes m ore than eigh t d re sse s in the sam e print. 
Soph isticated 

The woman who wears Kathleen 
Jackson ’s designs needs what she term s a “ fair body.” 
"They are plain but sophisticated silhouettes and they are body-cons­ cio u s,” say s Kathleen. “ I don't 

 make clothes for heavy women, but a size 12 can wear my clothes. 
Model Jeannie shows the differ­ ent looks Kathleen gives to the 
“ striptease” dress. , 
Jeannie adds Yves Saint Laur­ ent's peasant belt for color splash to the white tiered cotton. 
The sundresses in border prints are great for bare beach and city shopping looks. Accent them with ankle-w raps and a natural straw sun hat. 
The green and white chain print has its own matching stole. 
Kathleen’s designs are available in San Antonio at Svelte Veldt.

Throw Toothpick’ a curve 

There is such a thing as being too thin. 
Looking fashionably svelte is quite another. 
And. just as exercise can help take off the curves, it can change that straight up-and-down look to graceful contours. 

Dear Jennifer: 
Most exercises seem designed for people who want to get rid of what they have. 
I have the opposite prob­ lem: 
I am thin and shaped like a toothpick. 
My waist and hips are about the same — no curve — my legs are skinny and I ’m flat­ chested. Although I ’ve gained five pounds, it doesn’t go on in the right places. What can I do? — 
Brenda T., Dallas. 
Exercise is the answer. 
Build some muscle in the right places and that shapeless look will dis­ appear. You'll feel bel­ ter, too. A thin figure needs shaping up and toning just as much as a too-ample figure, but of­ ten “ Twiggy” types (like yourself) forget all about it!

There’s no need for your waist to be the same width as tin1 rest of you. It is one of the easiest places to trim with exer­ cise. Stand with your feet apart, with arms raised to the side at shoulder level.

Although you can’t en­ large your breasts with exercise, you can tone and firm the muscles and add contour. 
Standing with feet 

 apart and arms stretched out front at shoulder le­ vel. raise your arms overhead and describe huge circles — in wind­ mill fashion — on each side, returning to start­ ing position. Do the Kir­ ch's ll) to the front and ll) to the back. Really feel those muscles pulling. 

This list of exercises is just to get you going. 
Starting, of course, is al­ ways the hardest part. 
Once you begin, it is amazing to see how your body will respond. 
There are many excel­ lent books on exercise. 
Add some new ones to your schedule until you 

 are exercising a half-hour per day. then raise it to a full hour.

 wealth of the world's richest man 
— only-child J. Paul Getty — anti of the adventures of those daring on- ly-ehildren. explorer Robert Peary and flier Charles Lindbergh. 
Then there were those wonderful weavers of tales, onlv-ehildren Ro­ bert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Con­ rad and Hans Christian Andersen. 
And let’s not forget the legendary 
Sarah Bernhardt, an only child whose achievements as an actress have bicorne a historical yardstick for those who follow her. (Also San 
A ntonio’s own a rtist-w n ter - lecturer Amy Freeman Lee). 
Performers 
Many prom inent perform ers, musicians, artists and writers have been reared as only ch ild ren: 
Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Elvis 
Presley, Maria Callas, Sarah Cald­ well, Ringo Starr, .Jacqueline Su­ sa n a Tony Randall and Robert 
Wagner, to name some. 
With so many big pluses going for the only child, who’s been bad­ mouthing him — and why? The answer is complex. 
One theory states that people who put down only children may them­ selves be expressing envy and hos­ tility arising from feelings of in­ tense sibling rivalry. 
Others have suggested insecuri­ ty, jealousy, sexual inadequacy and a need for reassurance as reasons. 
Historically speaking, both na­ tional and religious pressures for large fam ilies have often taken the form of denigrating the small fa­ mily. 
Nations interested in militarism or population growth have designed governm ent program s to encour­ age the bearing of children and to discourage limiting family size. 
Big families are a real boon to business and the m ass media are chock-a-block with advertisements boosting big families and mother­ hood. 
More kids mean more purchases of diapers, baby food, cribs and all the follow-up paraphernalia in­

 voiced in having and raising chil­ dren. The drive for the big buck prom otes big fam ilies over the one-child family. 

Obviously, having only one child is no guarantee that the kid is go­ ing to be a happy, su cc essfu l, sm art superstar. No m ore than having six kids is a guarantee that they will be bottom -of-the-heap dullards. 
History is full of m arvelously su ccessfu l, brilliant and happy people who cam e from large fa­ m ilies. Outstanding exam ples are the Kennedys and the Buckleys. 
On a more personal level, an in­ dividual with brothers and sisters 
— even with only one sibling — is generally assured of com panion­ ship in growing up. 
For the adult, too, a brother or sister is someone who shares roots, experiences, memories and a com­ mon family bond. 
No guarantees 

N atu rally, an only child w ill never know the unique love of a brother or a sister and, further, must face family problems without such support. 
With over one million divorces a year in the United States — better than one in four m arriages now result in divorce — it would seem that all too m any children are forced to cope with the problem of parents’ separation solo. 
In such a situation, “ onliness’’ can really make m atters worse. 
Looking back, Barbara, an attrac­ tive commercial artist, recalls, “ I felt very lost and alone when I learned that my parents w ere about to divorce; I had no one to sh are my w orries and fears. I didn’t want to tell my friends — somehow that seem ed disloyal — and. anyway, I didn’t think they would understand. 
“ Also, the question of custody and visitation rights and all that seemed so much grimm er, som e­ how. because I was the only child involved. 
“After the divorce, I stayed with my mother. She soon began work­ ing and dating and I was on my own pretty early. It wasn’t easy.” 
Not bad 
Missing the special comforts and companionship of brothers and sis­ ters must occur at some time in the life of an only child. But that doesn’t make it all bad by a long shot. 
As the saying goes, “ Ifs what, you do with what you got.” 
Parents who relax, love and enjoy their only child, who are alert to real p itfa lls and d isregard outworn myths, who concentrate on the pluses and work to overcome the minuses, can find that raising an only child is a satisfying and rewarding experience for all con­ cerned.

We Need Help to Help Ourselves 
T 

 ell me. if you but have the will, why do we eontintie to walk around, burdened with fear* and phobias and stresses? Are we too embarrassed to tell a doetor. a clergyman or a friend about ourselves? Afraid to expose to another’s eyes our smoldering fires that seem to eonsume us? 
W e live in the midst of ehanges. vast changes imposed bv technology and so ttianv new philosophies for liking that seem to overwhelm us. We are caught in a confusing dilemma that tends to buckle our knees under the strain. There is one solvent that can dissolve our riddle, each of us must remain a student ever- readv to ask. to tell, to listen. And as a student willing to listen, we will find that it is not brains and brains alone that matter most. As a continuing and dedicated student, we will eventually discover that one element remains unchanged — the spiritual aud moral inheritance given you by family, church and sincere friends, fids is what fills our needs and gives never-ending meaning and reason to our strenuous efforts. 
Let us learn to se ek adviee. Each of us. in our own peculiar wav. needs help. 
W e must learn to listen, to use all the brains we have plus all we can borrow. 
Every dream, everv prayer, every desire must be directed to making 

 o u r se lv e s capable o f self-help. For even God doesn’t help those w h o won t help themselves. 
W hich Type Are I ou? 
There are four types of listeners who sit in the presence of the wise: The sponge, the funnel, the strainer and the sifter. 
I he sponge so a k s up everything. 
The funnel takes in at one ear and lets out at the other. 
The strainer lets pass the wine and retains the sediment. 
The sifter holds back the coarse and collects the fine flour. 
A pious man who observed dutiful respect for his parents and fellowman complained to his pastor saving: 
I have labored bani and long in the service of the Lord. and vet I have received no improvement. I ani still an ordinary and ig­ norant man. W bv have J failed to accomplish success?’ 
His pastor wisely answered: 
Von have gained the realization that you are ordinary and ignorant. This in itself is a worthv aeeompiishment.” l f you are one w h o s e load of p r o b le m s is weighing von down. seek help for se lf-h e lp . There are many who can lighten your load and strengthen your back through counseling with you. 
Each man remains wise *o long as he seeks wisdom. The moment lie think.- lit" has found it. be becomes and remains a fool. 
Seeking Fare Know ledge Extends Your Carpel's Life Expectancy 
Show me the housekeeper who cares and FII show you one who seeks knowledge through asking questions, reading about carpet care and remains a dedicated listener. 
Because of neglect in religious carpet care, because of our casual and neurotic fashion in living, very few carpeted floors live to the ripe old age that the chemistry' of its make-up would allow. For these reasons, the largest and most respected makers of carpet refuse to give a life-expeetaney guarantee on their products. Reliable and responsible carpet stores seldom unconditionally guarantee their carpet to wear X num ber of years. You w ill usually find that the smaller the mill and the younger the retail store, the larger the guarantee. 
A Rule O f Thumb Measure 
There is a popular rule of thum b estimate of a carpet s life expectancy and it goes like this. 
Ender the normal wear and tear. with proper maintenance and protective measures used: you may expect about 12 m onths’ wear for each SI.5o invested per yard in the earpet eost. 
Next H eek 
Ut- will discuss: H o w to detect salesman’s questionable guarantees.” Until then, think this over: 'Isn’t it unusual that presidents fail to improve. Heaven knows they receive plenty of unsolicited free adviee from the news media.”

In a city where m ost fam ily rooms boast a wrought iron bird cage and a set of tequila g la sses, it’s refreshing and inter­ e stin g to find a fa­ mily with an English room. 

Cicely and F’aul F\ Ador lived at the R A F base, 
Chicksands, 
England from 19Ho-84 and their den reflects the British mood with its mementos. 

“ I loved England and wasn't ready to return home when we did,” Ci­ cely says. “ I still get ex­ cited when I think about boarding the train into 
London.” 

Each of the souvenirs carries its own personal story and a glimpse into 
English history and cul­ ture. 
The beginning of their slay was spent in the 
English market town of 
Hitehin, Tift miles from 
London. 
A series of hand-woven baskets were acquired from a cottage industry, where a British woman was reviving a dying art. 
In her thatch-roofed cot­ tage she wove and taught others to weave river reeds into baskets. Unu­ sual shapes, such as weights and flatirons, were used as molds. 
They were sold to the Li­ berty Stores. 
No .sales 
An English m arket basket sits near the wall. 
“ British women shop d aily,” 
Cicely says. 
“ Since the British are so conservative, there are no blatant week-end spe­ cial advertisements.” 
Hanging above the ta­ ble are matched copper coach lamps (174o, ini­ tialled by the maker) and modernized to hold flash­ ing lamp bulbs. 
Tall ship lanterns stand on the floor, reminiscent of the fore and aft light­ ing used to guide ships safely into harbor. 
When the Aders first arrived in the little vil­ lage of Hitehin, they found fields of lavendar. 
These had been the first in England. A set of la­ vender soaps and per­ fumes still brings back a picture of gently blowing fields. A chemist shop sold the typical British scent. 
Near the door matched set of antique servant bells hangs on an octave board. 
The 
83-year-old bell-ringer maker had tuned them so the talented could tap out 
“ God Save the Queen.” 
The Aders visited the 
Wedgewood factory and watched their souvenirs made from the first step 
Candlestick holders and vases, as well as jewelry, were brought back 
Two antique pillow lace bobbins and a handker­ chief edged in that lace are reminders of another dying art. The craft is very precise and de­ manding and few of the young people are learn ing it. 
K n it dolls 
And although there are no longer doll-age young­ sters in the Ader home, two knitted character dolls are displayed. The dolls, “ Noddy” and “ Big 
E a rs ” are characters from the popular English children’s author. Enid 
Blyton. Not only the clothes, but the dolls themselves are hand- knitted. 
Cicely also joined the hobbyists who were doing monumental brass rub bings in old churches 
With the local vicar’s permission, she used ar­ chitect’s tracing paper and cobbler’s wax to rub off a copy of detailed monuments to knights, bishops, ladies and merchants. 
One large knight, which was made in 
Trumpington, 
Cam- bridgeshirehighlightsone wall. Each section has a special meaning includ­ ing a small dog at his feet. One of the rubbings is from Westminster Ab­ bey, where an appoint­ ment is necessary to do the work. The day they did this one was special, since the Queen also paid a visit on that day. 
The monumental brasses were made between the 13th and 18th century and the rubbings are on the same level as 
Asiatic temple rubbings and American tombstone rubbings. 
Two decorative copper measures, usually found 

 in graduated size sets in 
Old English Pubs are ex­ hibited. One is D/i gill size and the others looks to be about a quart size — and it holds an arrange­ ment of dried grasses. 

Paul’s contribution to the English memorabilia is his framed English coin collection. 
Of course, you couldn’t have an English room without a “ spot of tea.” 
Cicely’s collection in­ 

 cludes a hand made tea cozy- and two wooden 
Victorian-age tea caddies. The Victorian lady-of-the-house kept the valuable tea locked in her quarters, mixng the amount needed for each pot and entrusting only that to the maid. 
The English literary sites and environment were really enjoyed by the Aders, since they had met at the University of 
Carolina where they were both studying for their master’s degrees in the literary field. 

B R A S S ru b b in g d e c o r a te s the 
English room of the Paul A ders 

Both studied under the 
GI Bill. Cicely served in the W A V ES and Paul with the Air F’orce during 
World War II. Paul was stationed in England at that time, also. 
Cicely was one of a four member panel of Ameri­ can Officers Wives in 
England who spoke to women’s church, school and social groups about 
American geography, home life, education and community life. The pan-' el was booked two years in advance and was voted the most popular in Bed­ fordshire. 
Husband F’aul was a’ member of the USAF Se­ curity Service for 17 years and retired in 1969 as a lieutenant colonel. 
Besides collecting coins, another hobby is writing. 
He took fourth prize in the Air Force Story con­ test while in England and published his first book, 
“ We 
Always 
Come 
Back,” in London. Now site manager of the As­ bury United Methodist 
Church nutrition site, he has another book soon to be released. 
Children 
The Aders have three children. Don, 25, a grad­ uate of A&M, who is now a computer programmer working in College Sta­ tion with Texas Trans­ portation 
Institute. • In 
England, as a 9-year-old he participated in idea exchange programs between 
H r i t i s Ii and 
American liny Scouts. 
Lindy, 21, will receive her master’s degree in 
English from St. Mary’s 
University on Mother’s 
Day. She has earned her entire education on scho­ larships and w ill com­ mute to UT in Austin on a study grant to earn her 
,Ph.D. in the fall. 
Alison is a 16 year old junior at Churchill who has artistic talent. Two years in a row she’s taken prizes in Spanish art competitions. 
The Aders keep in con­ tact with British friends and occasionally have guests from there. 
“ Some day we’d like to go back,” Cicely says, 
“ We found England in­ triguing — always some­ thing to do or see and things to learn.”

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday M ay I 1977 
Teens find summer fu n for children 

Unless you have lived in Europe or on the East 
Coast, a 
“ mother’s help’’ may be new to you. 
A mother’s help is a teen­ ager who lives with a family during the summer or school holidays to take charge of the children’s activities. 
Many times the mother’s help speaks a language dif­ ferent from that of the host family. 
“ English fam ilies often have French girls come in so the children can improve their French,’’ Mrs. David L. 
Hay, wife of a military re­ tiree, said. 
“ In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, an Italian mother had a 
French mother’s help to answer the telephone, write social notes and to supervise the children.” 
Mrs. Hay had a mother’s help in England six years ago. At the time her children were 2, 5, 9 and ll. 

- B y --------------- 

EDNA M C G A FFEY 

“ The teen-ager must have the skills and social graces required for the place and family. In turn, the family provides her room, board and pocket money.” 
Serving as a mother’s help gives a teen-ager an oppor­ tunity to live in a family dif­ ferent from her own, Mrs. 
Hay said. 
If the teen-ager is consi­ dering a career as a teacher or nurse, the experience might help her make up her mind. 
“ Some teen-agers never have been around children in a supervisory capacity,” 
Mrs. Ray said. 
Trips 

Often the girl comes from a distance, and the family pays her transportation. 
“ One English girl spent a year in Los Angeles,” Mrs.

“ My mother’s help was 
IB and could drive a car. She played with the children and took them places,” Mrs. Ray said. 
It worked out so well, Mrs. 
Ray would like to see her daughter Mary, age 15, have the experience this summer. 
Duties 
Mrs. Ray explained the mother’s help is not a do­ mestic. The arrangement is between equals. Duties focus on the children rather than household chores. 
“ It is not an economic thing. Not all work has to be for pay,” Mrs. Ray empha­ sized. 

Ray said. 
“ Youngsters on the East 
Coast never get this far south.” 
To a girl from another area of United States, serving as a mother’s help would be an opportunity to live here a few months. 
Families who have such help are primarily those of professional and executive men in the upper-middle in­ come bracket, Mrs. Ray said. 
“ Families who go to the lake, woods or ranch . during the summer often have so­ meone to help with the chil­ dren.” 
“ In london about this time of year, you begin to see 

 classified ads for mother’s helps to go to the seashore or forest.” 
Often a foreign family will require a mother’s help to speak English so the mother and children can learn Eng­ lish. 
Iii this area, a family away from home in the evenings might want a mother’s help, 
Mrs. Ray said. 
“ A family not native to San 
Antonio might like to have a local girl who knows how to get around the city and who could take children to the park, zoo or other outing. 
"A grandmother who ex­ pects grandchildren to be in and out during the summer might like a mother’s help.” 
A mother with a handi­ capped child might find such assistance would relieve her from the steady care, Mrs. 
Ray said. 

Sometimes the mother’s help does not live with the host family. She remains in her own home and arranges to take care of the children on specific days or hours on a monthly or weekly basis. 

Guide 

Mrs. Ray believes her daughter, Mary, would en­ joy this type of European- oriented experience — and that other San Antonio girls would also like the oppor­ tunity. 
“ Mary can ride, speak 
French, swim and take basic care of children. She could tutor a B or 7-year-old child in reading and arithmetic and take children out for a day.” 
Such an experience is a 
“ bonus” for both the mother’s help and the fami­ ly. 

Jim Burdett takes 

You’ve got to have heart to ride 68 miles in a charity cycle- thon. But Jim Bur­ dett Sr. thinks he’s lucky that his heart is strong enough to make the trip. 
When the wheels begin turning in the American 
Heart Association’s an­ nual cyclethon here Sa­ turday in M cAllister 
Park, which for Burdett to log exactly 68 miles for his 68 years. 
If that’s not remarka­ ble enough. Burdett had open heart surgery three and a half years ago. 
This won’t be the first 
Heart Association cy­ clethon for the energetic grandfather who pedaled the furthest distance, 66 miles, in the ‘75 event. 
Last year, an erratic heartbeat sidelined 
Burdett, but this year he’s back in the race. 
“ I ’m feeling great!” boasts Burdett who’s been training the past few weeks riding 5o-1oo miles per week. 
“ Many people think I have no business riding a bicycle or ask, ‘Does your doctor know about all this?’ but they have the wrong attitude,” 
Burdett chuckles. 
“ My doctor thinks ifs great,” claims the cyclist who doesn’t take any medication for heart problems. 
“ My doctor okays that too. You can’t argue with success,” adds Burdett. 
However, he cautions that persons should check with their physi­ cian before “ throwing out the pills.” 
Unlikely 

“ I was taking medicine all day and half the night, but not anymore. I had a perfect cardiagram a few months ago.” (Although his diet isn’t restricted, 
Burdett doesn’t use any salt.) 
Retired from Kelly 
A F B , Burdett always thought he was an unli­ kely candidate for a heart attack, but he landed up in an operating room in 
Santa Rosa Hospital in 
December, 1973, when he underwent triple by-pass 

 r-B y 
SUSAN BOE 

 heart surgery. 
He was on his feet in a few days, though. “ Two pretty nurses stood on each side and helped me take my first steps. That was almost worth the operation,” 
Burdett smiled. 
Twelve days after the surgery, he walked one mile around his neigh­ borhood and one week later he clocked three miles. 
Burdett was a cyclist before his heart attack but it wasn't until after the operation that he be­ came an exercise enthu­ siast. 
“ I can’t jog, but I love to walk and ride. A bicy­ cle is best for me because 
I can exert as much en­ ergy as I want,” says the long-distance cyclist, who pumps a 1o-speed 
French bike. 
His cycling interest grew until the spring of 
‘75 when his Kelly co­ workers urged him to enter the Heart Associa­ tion’s cyclethon. 
Track 

Burdett recalls he was the last person on the track that day in ‘75. 
“ When I came around the final time, they (cycle­ thon officials) were all waiting for me and ready to go home.” 
A few weeks later, 
Burdett and a friend drove to Fredericksburg, left their car at 4:3o a.m. and rode their bicycles into downtown San An­ tonio at ll a.m.—in time for church at the Salva­ tion Army. 

Burdett hopes he’ll ride the biggest distance in this year’s competition, but fears that any 
“ trained youngsters” would easily beat him. lf he “ goes the longest m ile,” he’ll win 
12 country and Western al­ bums. He’s also seeking sponsorships from neigh­ bors and friends 
(proceeds will go to the 
Heart Association) which may qualify him for a television set—awarded to the cyclist who collects the most money.

Clare Luce flew into Washing­ ton for a spring sojourn in her 
Watergate apartment and at 74 is feeling like a new woman. 
It seems she stopped at Los Angeles en route from Honolulu to visit her friends Pat and Gerry Frawley. 
Pat Frawley, who owns Lady Schick, a motion picture company and heaven knows what all, is the man who found­ ed the Schick Centers that cure you of smoking. For a long time he and his wife have been telling Clare that she should give up smoking. 
‘‘I was really an addict," said Clare. 
“ I had to get over it.” She chain­ smoked whenever she was writing or conversi na ana ♦ »?"♦ "deled up to a lot of cigarettes.

So she decided to take the treatments. She had four of them, each 
4o minutes to an hour long and "after four days I quit smoking,” said Mrs. 
Luce. 
Does she notice any difference? "I feel I can breathe more freely and I wake up feeling good and the room smells good.” Does she miss it? “ Only vaguely but not enough to want to smoke.” 
The treatments, she said, were pri­ vate, not a group thing which she would have detested, and the condi­ tioning-type therapy, designed by doc­ tors, is the same used for weight control. It may be bad news to tobacco raisers but Fraw ley is opening centers in a number of other cities. 
Briefings 

Rosalynn Carter was briefed on in­ telligence by (JIA director Stansfield 
Turner last week; she had also been briefed on foreign affairs by national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. 
President Carter wants her to have a grasp of the issues. He ordered new energy czar James Schlesinger to brief his wife and others in his family on the whole energy problem and also cabinet members and their wives and members of the First Lady’s staff. He needs all the supporters and boosters he can get.

The Harold Browns made the fastest exit from Capitol Hill iii history follow­ ing Carter’s speech, tearing through town to arrive at the embassy at 9:5(1.

WHERE 1)o YOD STAND ON YOUR CYCLE? 

 it is generally agreed that everyone goes through cycles. We all have our up and down days. These cycles are called biorhythms. A 23-day physical cycle. A 2B-day emotional cycle. A 
33-day intellectual cycle. Your daily positions in each of these cycles has a lot to do with how you feel. So, if you know what your biorhythms will be for any given day, chances are you'll have a pretty good idea of how you can expect to feel. That's why people keep track of their bio­ rhythms. Because by knowing when you’re up biorhythmically you can be sure you put the time to good use. 
And by knowing when you're down biorhythmically you can pick your­ self up psychologically. Biorhythms are used by airlines, industry and

 sports players to determine what days are best for them. To keep track of your biorhythms you could use an

Middle age melodrama a tale of knobby knees 

It was a birthday occasion for my sister-in-law. Miss Sophisti­ cate seated next to me kept say­ ing, “Is it the Big Four? 
She kept repeating herself, and all she was drawing from me was a blank. 
After all, in my group any reference to the “ Big Four” means bad things are happening at Potsdam or Notre 
Dame has revived the Four Horsemen. 
Then the dawn—the Big Four was age 4o —the beginning of the end in her mind’s eye. 
Having already edged way past 39. I immediately concluded I didn’t parti-

 eularly like that child—she couldn’t have been a day over 28. What does she know about the Big Four. 
My hubby was 4o on Valentines’ Day and he didn’t turn into a pumpkin. 
However, I have noticed that the past few months I am more aware of my age. I seem to make a point of letting people know I’m nearing the Big Four. 
And of course I expect them to be flabbergasted, since I don’t “ look a day over 3o.” 
“ If life begins at 4o. I’m ready!” I insist. 
I still feel like a youngster. But I have also noticed that it takes a bit more effort to act like one. 
It also bothers me to go shopping. 
Clothes either make me look like so-

Mother. I can’t get into the swing of the matronly image. Just because I’m someone’s Mother doesn’t mean I have to look the part. 
I knew it was all going downhill a couple of years back. On one of my infrequent visits to my parents, Mother said, “Well, you’re certainly looking your age!” 
That was even before she said hello. 
And one of the reasons my trips are infrequent. 
I can’t ever remember Mother say­ ing anything kind about my appear­ ance: 
“ You can’t be a majorette, you’re legs are too skinny.” 
“ Run for cheerleader? Who do you think would vote for those knobby knees?” 
“ Why you’re even more flat-chested than I was.” 
I sometime wondered if she didn't realize that we had a mirror in our 

 room. Or that I was perfectly aware that I could see directly to my feet without any interfering bum ps in- between. 
Being 4o is changing all that. Middle age spread is wonderful. After all those years of being shaped like a broom handle. I’m beginning to look like a girl.

The hips are getting hippier and the bumps have grown enough that I have stopped stuffing old socks in the top of my bathing suit. 
Beauty 

The middle years have brought an­ other plus — the discovery that sex is not only beautiful, but fun. 
What heresy that would be in the puritanical household of my upbring­ ing where sex was discussed in the sam e tone and words reserved for drunkards, deadbeats and girls who wore too much makeup. 
How I envy the generation that has been led to believe that their bodies are not a source of shame, but evidence of 
God’s finest hour in the scheme of creation. 
The best of all is the knowledge that marriage can be joyful—a life fully shared is a life complete. Something I failed to notice the first time around. 
Here we are, newlyweds at 4o, be­ ginning our lives all over with none of the charade that youth demands. 
Who else would share the crises of a middle age woman, but a middle age man? Who else would promise to cherish her and her knobby knees forever?

 man, and believe me, I look every day of it — and then some. My hus­ band recently died after a terrible 18-month ill­ ness, and all that weep­ ing and grieving put years on my face.

No, I never have, but when I think I need one, 
PII certainly give it ser­ ious consideration. 
And now, I have some good news for you: A new wrinkle concerning get­ ting rid of the old ones developed last year. The 
I.R S. ruled that the cost 

 of cosmetic surgery is a legitimate deductible medical expense. Women 
(and men, too) can now get a complete facelift — chin, neck, jowls, under the eyes, the eyelids — the works — and it’s tax deductible! 
I am indebted to my good friend, 
Sylvia 
Porter, for this up-to- date information. 

DEAR ABBY: lf an 
American man marries a 
European woman, does she autom atically be­ come an 
American citizen? Answer in your column as soon as possi­ ble as a very important decision is predicated on your reply. 
— DON’T 
SION THIS 
DEAR DON’T: No one 
“ autom atically” be­ comes an American citi­ zen by m arrying an 
American. There is a three-year waiting per­ iod. Then tests must be taken, lf the tests are passed, the person must then be “ sworn in.” 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: Why do we usually get gout in the big toe first rather than in other parts of the body? — H.R. 

You don’t always get it there first, but the toe joint is often the first to complain. The first attack may affect any heavily-used weight-bearing joint, as the hip or ankle. 
A recent article in the Annals of In­ ternal Medicine, written by Dr. Peter 
Simkin, discusses this subject. His theme is this: 
(lout usually occurs in the ten years after 55, when the base of the great toe has already shown signs of wear and tear (osteoarthritis). 
The gouty person has already had some degree of uric acid concentration in the body for years. The joint fluid therefore contains tiny urates, which are crystals formed from the uric acid. 
The scene, thus, is set for a first attack, usually in the middle of the night following a day of activity. 
The activity provokes an increase in the toe joint fluid, hence an even greater concentration of the crystals. 
During sleep these clump, just as su­ gar crystals would in a glass of sugar and water mixture left standing. The combination of this and the aggravat­ ed osteoarthritis cause the great pain, which usually carries over to the next day. 
Prompt treatment with certain drugs gives relief, and other medicines may be taken afterwards to forestall attacks. 

Other aspects of gout and treatment are discussed in my booklet, “ Gout — 
The Modern Way to Handle It,” which might help in further understanding. 
Send 35 cents and a stamped, self- addressed envelope to cover printing and handling to me care of the Ex- press-News, Box 217a, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78297. and I’ll send you a copy. 
Voltage 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: My electrocar­ diogram shows low voltage. My doctor offers no explanation except that it is nothing to worry about, and that it is difficult to explain to a lay person. 
Could this cause a short energy span? 
Would you please explain what low voltage means? Does it restrict one in any way? — Mrs. L. 
When a muscle (any muscle) con­ tracts it produces certain electrical energy. The electrocardiogram mea­ sures the force, expressed as voltage. 
Yours is apparently somewhat lower than normal, which ordinarily is no 

 cause for great concern. However, a low force of the heart can reflect other disorders, such as low thyroid gland function or low blood potassium. 

Either might cause a “ short energy span,” as you put it, and might limit physical activity. 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: 
My daughter has proctitis and inflammation of the rectum and colon. She was told there is no cure and that she may have to have the colon removed. 
Can you tell me what causes it and the correct treatment? Whom should she consult? She is 38. — R.M.S. 
Proctitis is inflammation of the rec­ tum. Inflammation of the colon (large intestine) is called colitis. Often they go together. 
Infection by any of a number of organisms can be the cause — TB among them. Also, prolonged antibio­ tic therapy can lead to it. Painful diarrhea is a feature. 
It depends on who told your daughter there was no cure. Extensive colon tests are needed to identify the specific 
“ bug” involved, and locally applied steroid drugs (with suppositories or enemas) are usually effective. Remo­ val of part of the colon above the rectum is sometimes necessary. 
For sure, it can be mighty difficult to clear up, but no need for such a fatalistic attitude. A proctologist, a physician who treats the rectum and its disorders, would be the specialist to consult. 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I ve been told my vision is 2o-4o. Just exactly what does this mean. My smart highschooler explained it to me, but I wonder if he has it right. He says my vision is 2o feet off. - L.J. 
Your son is right, but his explanation may fall short of clarity. 
Imagine yourself and a person with normal vision standing side by side both looking at one object exactly 4o feet away. 
The object would have to be moved in until it was only 2o feet away for you to see it clearly. The normal person sees it clearly the full 4o feet away. So you have 2o-4o vision. 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: 
I have heard about these developers that are reallv supposed to enlarge the bustline in a short time. Some are exercisers, and some are protein drinks. How safe are the developers? Which is best? Mrs. 
TY. 
First of all, neither the "bust de­ veloper” nor the protein drink (what-, ever it is) will change your bustline. 
I can’t comment on the safety aspect of the “ bust developer” except to say the government acts every once in a while to remove one from the market because of potential harm. The best advice for you, if you must use one, is to find out if it is approved for use by the government. 
A local office of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration will tell you if a particular device has been declared unsafe.

Turns tables on reporter 

Dear Ann: Recently 

 a couple in our small community celebrat­ ed their 6oth wed­ ding anniversary. 

Since five newspapers cover this area (two dailies, a weekly, a bi­ weekly and a five-a- vveek) and there are lots of TV and radio stations, it seemed best to call a press conference. 
One of the reporters asked the dignified silver-haired woman if she ever had had an abortion. Her reply was, 
“ No.” The next question: 
“ Were you ever unfaith­ ful to your husband in all those 6o years?” 
She hesitated a mo­ ment, then said firmly, 
“ Young lady, I can’t see how my answer to that question could possibly matter to you.” 
A few moments later the same brass-plated female reporter asked the silver-haired lady about her views on con­ traception. She tried to contain her disgust and finally replied, “ I ’ve learned that young peo­ ple don’t care two hoots or a holler what older people think about that subject.” 

The reporter persisted, 
“ Did you and your hus­ band practice birth control? You only have three children.” 

The other reporters were pretty fed up by this time. One of them broke the tension by saying, "I suspect from your answers that you’ve been reading Ann Landers.” 
She came back with: 

“ You’re absolutely right. 
I also read the Bible and it says, ‘A soft answer turneth away wrath.’” 
Isn’t that beautiful? — 
Another Anne 

Dear Anne: 
Beautiful is the word. 

A bouquet of skunk cabbage to those clods who call themselves re­ porters. I learned long ago that just because a person has the gall to ask any question that comes to his mind doesn t mean he (or she) is entitled to an answer. 

Gram m ar 

Dear Ann: My husband arid I have a few friends, not many. When they come to visit I say very little. I’m sure they think 
I am anti-social. Actual­ ly, I love to talk but I must be very careful w hat I say because if my husband decides I didn’t use the proper words hei makes my life hell. 
I 
The same is true when we go visiting. I must measure my words be­ cause if I say something he doesn't like he be­ comes angry and yells at me all the way home. We could both be killed be­ cause he drives like a maniac when he gets angry. 
For obvious reasons, I can’t receive a written reply from you (he opens 
A LL the m ail), but ac­ tually, I don’t need ad­ vice. I know the solution to my problem, and one of these days I intend to have some peace in my life. — Just Waiting

Q. “ Old pocket knives intrigue 

 me.” — Leonard, Vancouver, 
Wash. 
A: The pursuer of pocket knives will undoubtedly uncover many fascinating types displaying handles of various materials such as silver, gold, bone, ivory and mother of pearl. 
One having a genuine deer s foot handle sold for $1 in 19o1. They were made in many sizes ranging from a miniature single blade model designed to be worn as a charm, to larger types boasting several blades and numerous adjuncts. 
Among the adjuncts were bottle openers, screw drivers and manicure blades. Who could ask for anything more? 
Well, let's consider one combination from the early 19oos composed of a knife blade, corkscrew, button hook and nail file.

Behind the image o f TY news 

By RICHARD ERICKSON 

EXPRESS N E W S BUSINESS WRITER 

The stylized sketch-pictures roll across the television screen s, show ing a quick glimpse of the city skyline, a crowd scene and an astronaut on the moon. 

The anchorm an’s name grinds apart to the sounds of teletype-like music to reveal his unsmiling portrait while a deep com m anding voice announces: 
“ Ben Aycrigg, NEWSWATCH!” 

So San Antonio television viewers, the name would be Don Colson. But in 
Orlando, Fla., it’s Ben Aycrigg just as it is Vince Gibbens in Providence, R.I., 
Hugh DeMoss in Columbus, Ohio, and 
Chuck Moore in Atlanta, Ga. 
Hit the jackpot 

But the scene — except for faces and skylines — is the same in each city, a product of San Antonio-based Ander­ son Advertising Inc. 

The firm ’s “ Newswatch” campaign hit the jackpot. It was so successful for local Channel 12 that all of the Outlet 
Inc. stations — the com pany which owns KSAT-TV — now have a version. 

And the feather in the cap cam e when the Storer Broadcasting Co. sta­ tion in Atlanta, WAGA-TV Channel 5, bought the package and concept for its 

 potential audience of more than 3 mil­ lion people. 

Anderson Advertising’s creative dir­ ector and vice president, Chuck An­ derson, sits comfortably slouched in a conference room chair, trying to ex­ plain what goes into an advertising package that has gained so much at­ tention. 

“ The agency-client relationship is really important, the rapport between the two,” he said. “ I mean, they have to expose information to you to allow you to do the job right, information that is secret, that even the people within the business might not know.” 

He shakes his head and m urm urs, 
“ It sounds like a military operation.” 
The first m aneuver cam e when An­ derson was called to present a sample of his agency’s product for KSAT-TV officers, who were planning to publi­ cize their new anchorman, new format and new set. 
First maneuver 

“ Most agencies have a standard ca­ pability presentation,” Anderson ex­ plained. “ M ost of the tim e it is multimedia and gives an overview of your work and capabilities.”

Oil firm prom ises to work wonders 

Within the next few months, 
San Antonio motorists will be hearing more and more about a new brand of oil for their cars, trucks and farm equipment. 
This new oil, backers say, will in­ 

 crease gas milage, reduce friction and only need changing every 75,ooo miles. 
Sound too good to be true? T hat’s what technical experts from several of the nation’s leading oil companies be­ lieve. 
Moly Oils of San Antonio Inc. is a 
S.A.. London tie as unfavorites 

San Antonio tied with London and Zurich as the favorite city for traveling businessmen, according to a survey published by Industry 
Week Magazine. 

Unfortunately, that tie occurred at the bottom of the most-preferred list. The Alamo City, along with the foreign capitals, received only one vote apiece, as did Oklahoma City and St. Paul, Minn. 

San Francisco was the top choice of the 16o middle to upper managers questioned by the publication. More than half, however, declined to name a favorite city. 
The least favorite city, according to a magazine spokesman, was New 
York City, by a massive 37 per cent of those who voted. 

Among airlines, those surveyed picked United over American as their favorite by less than a percentage point, 22.7 per cent to 22.1 per cent. 
Delta and TWA followed with 11.7 per cent and ll per cent respectively with Continental, Eastern, Southern and Allegheny trailing. 

Eastern topped the list of least liked airlines with 2o.9 per cent followed by Alleghany (17.3 per cent), United (IO per cent), TWA (8.2 per cent) and Braniff (6.4 per cent). 

Texas International placed seventh on the least-liked airlines list which the spokesman termed unusually strong reaction for — or against 
— a regional system. 

It was no contest when it came to the traveling businessmen’s favorite hotel-motel chain. Holiday Inn garnered more than 44 per cent of the vote with respondents complimenting the proximity of most outlets to airports or industrial parks and the quality of food served. 

Tied for a distant second were Marriott and Sheraton, followed, in order, by Hilton, Hyatt, Ramada and Howard Johnson’s. 

Among rental car companies, Hertz won both contests, getting 41.8 per cent of the favorite vote but 51.7 per cent of the least favorite at the same time. That prompted the spokesman to remark that, with rental cars and businessmen, it was a real love and hate relationship. 

 new firm in town, finding distributors for a natural motor oil containing a I per cent suspension of molybdenum sulfide as one of eight additives. 

M olybdenum — a tongue-tw isting name shortened to moly by most — is an ore mined mostly in Colorado. It has proven to be a successful dry lu­ bricant and friction-reduction agent. 

Coating the inside of an automobile engine during continued use, company spokesmen report, will create a slick surface which is moisture and sludge repellent. 
More horsepower 

Reduction of friction means an in­ crease of 4 to 9 per cent in gas mileage, a 3.6 per cent boost in horsepower, a reduction in oil consumption and less wear on vital engine parts, they say. 

“ The closest way to describe it is to compare it to putting a teflon coating on the inside of your engine, only this is much h a rd e r,” according to Bill 
Graham, president of the firm. 

A crankcase of Moly Oil will go 
75,ooo miles or more without the need for an oil change, he said. 

Graham and seven otner area distri­ buters will be pushing a sales program in the next few months based on fuel and oil conservation and general edu­ cation of the properties of their pro­ duct. 

A quart of Moly Oil will retail for about $8. 

Allen Sw eeley, m anager of the 
A m alie R efining Co. en g ineering departm ent in Dallas, says he can’t find too much fault with Moly Oil claims of possible increased mileage and less friction but that 75,ooo-mile oil change is something else again. 

“ I’m not trying to bad-mouth Moly 
Oils, but just because it has moly in it doesn’t mean it is an extended or long

An extensive q u estio n n aire was handed out to company executives to get an idea of what goals Channel 12 had in mind for its promotion cam ­ paign. 
The questions included everything from station self-image, to how ex­ actly the operation was to be identified and where to send the bill. 
“ And it gives a wealth of information on where to head a creative approach,” 
Anderson added. 
Answers in hand, he joined members of the Hayes Productions Inc. in se­ veral quick strategy sessions, discuss­ ing directions and laying out creative and financial guidelines.

An independent production com ­ pany, Hayes does work for a number of 
San Antonio agencies and handles most of Anderson’s visual material. 
Several ideas were suggested and u ltim ately d iscard ed (see box at right). 
A storyboard — cartoon-like draw ­ ings demonstrating what the campaign would look like — was p re p a re d . 
Houston announcer Marshall Pengra, a famous com m anding voice, was con­ tacted. Com poser Mike By rn w rote some tentative music and recorded it. 
“ We told Mike we wanted a teletype feeling blending to a definite beat and pattern so Bill (Hayes) had something to pace the visuals on,” Anderson said. 
“ We returned to (KSAT’s general manager) Jim Schiavone and his staff with the storyboard, radio script, the cost estimate and, most importantly, the rationale to the whole approach.

That approach — later discribed by

His progressive leadership will enable Northside to continue its "new growth" pattern and its famous friendly service to the residents and businesses of the north­ side area and the city as a whole. 

 sp e n d in g for g ra n te d , as so m any budget-makers do. Everything should be re-examined from the ground up, to see each item is truly needed in your budget and, if so. whether th e re’s a cheaper way to accomplish the same result. 
Many of the expenditures that seem inviolable may not be. once you think about them. f o r e x a m p le , a fam ily fa r from public transportation, with wife and children at home, may assum e that two ears are essential — one for the husband to drive to work, the other for domestic errands. 
But there’s an alternative to the se­ cond ear th at’s almost as convenient and potentially much cheaper. 
It cost an average of $2,173 a year in 
1976 to keep a standard-sized ear for four y e a rs , a c co rd in g to fig u re s compiled by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. That included the cost of depreciation, gasoline and oil, in­ su ran ce, re p a irs, p ark in g fees and other incidentals. 
If the ear was bought on the install­ ment plan, interest paym ents would drive the annual cost even higher. 
Assuming that the school or shopping center is no more than a $3 taxi ride away, you could call a cab 14 times a week for about the sam e an­ nual cost. 
If your insurance bill is particularly high, you might even be able to aver­ age a dozen $4 or $5 taxi rides -a week for what it costs you to maintain your second ear (figure it out yourself.) 
Assuming you can get along on so­ mething less than $4o a week in cab fares, you could actually save money by selling the second ear and calling taxis instead. 
If you’re near a bus or train line, you could cut your tran sp o rtatio n costs even more. 
Reconsider thinking 
This is the kind of thinking that goes to zero-based budgeting. R ather than assuming that your current expenses

 fur housing, transportation, utilities, insurance and so on are fixed, you re­ consider them one by one, in light of your overall objectives, and ask what alternatives are available. 
Often the alternatives are so drastic that you won’t want to consider them. 
For exam ple, even though y o u ’re 
‘‘house p oor,” you m ig h t prefer to suffer along on a self-denying budget while waiting for your income to catch up with your m ortgage, heating, in­ surance and maintenance expenses. 
When put to the wall. however, other fa m ilie s m ig h t well d ec id e th a t a sm aller house is a fair exchange for financial peace of mind. 
Reduce costs 
Moving on to other items, you can reduce the cost of house and car in­ surance by reducing the deductible. 
If your life insurance costs are bur­ densom e and y o u ’re ca rry in g cash- value policies, it’s possible to switch to term insurance, using the cash values to pay the premiums. 
( Your coverage will run out when the cash value does and you’ll have used up the savings you accumulated in the policy. 
(For some families, this is undesir­ able. For others, perhaps those whose children are leaving home and who have good pensions due, it m ight be quite sensible. It depends on your per­ sonal circumstances). lf you’re carrying a high debt load, hence wasting a lot of money on inter­ est payments, a sensible course is to buy nothing new — just live with what you have — until the debts are paid off. 
Getting rid of that interest expense will increase your spendable income. 

Line by line 
The point is to go over each budget item, line by line, to see what m atters m ost and what can be achieved by cheaper means. 

If you find yourself haggling with your spouse about niggling items, you haven’t addressed the basic issues. 

Zero-based budgeting means exactly that; reinventing your life from the ground up, to see if th ere’s a better way to live on the income you have.

How to easily wade through annual 

LO S A N G E L E S N E W S SERVIC E 
NEW YORK — There are about 25 million Americans who own a pieee of the corporate pie, as stockholders. 
Yet a lot of them don’t quite know w hat’s in that pie, despite corporate efforts (with government prodding) to tell ail in their annual reports. 
Over the next couple of months, all those shareholders will be getting fat envelopes in the mail. Odds are that the bulk of them probably won’t even bother to get past the first couple of pages of the slick, expensively pro­ duced booklets inside those envelopes. 
But the num bers and words inside reflect the econom ic h ea lth of the companies, and the soundness of their investments. 
Wading through the facts and figures cram m ed into the annual report, much less understanding them, may seem tougher than going through molasses in a cold snap. But a few pointers from the experts may help take the mystery out of the morass. 
Fundamental skills 
Edward J. Weinstein, a New York accountant, firm ly believes that an­ yone with the most fundam ental ad­ ding and subtracting skills can under­ stand an annual report. 
He offers some quick rules of thumb about how to approach an annual re­ port: 
Look at the financial statements first. Most people tend to look at the num bers after they’ve read m anage­ m ent’s glowing prose in the front of the report, which colors th e ir response 
(and dulls their senses) to the actual figures that follow. 
Don’t fall into that trap. Read all those n u m b e re up and down. Ask questions about anything that looks funny to you (a big gain or loss some­ where from last year, for instance, or a number that looks far out of proportion to the others on a page). Keep them in the back of your head as you read on. 
• Next, read the president’s lefter. 
Then read the m anagem ent analysis. 
Test yourself whether the people who 

 reports 

 run this corporation have anticipated the questions you came up with when you read through the n u m b ers and whether they’ve tried to answer them. 
If not, you may have spotted some sore sports. 
• Read the footnotes. They usually appear after the financial revelations. 
T hey m ay s p o tlig h t an occasio n al tricky little point. 
One thing, for instance, is a note usually headed “ Contingencies.” Read that one carefully. Corporations are required (by the S ecurities and E x ­ c h a n g e C o m m issio n ) to let s to c k ­ holders know about any possible loss on the horizon, like a lawsuit still in the courts that might end up costing the company a bundle. 
• 
Read the report of the corpora­ tion's independent auditors. 
This usually appears at the tail end of the financial statements. That short report should be a m ore or less pro form a w rap-up. sta tin g th at fig u res have been audited and verified according to approved accounting practices. Then the accounting firm signs its name. 
This little statem ent should be the sam e as last y ear’s. Short, sweet and stan d ard . If th e re ’s a difference of som e sort — an added p a ra g ra p h , perhaps — watch out. T hat’s a danger sign that there’s some discrepancy between how' the accountant-auditors look at the figures and how m anage­ ment wants them put down. 
A company is making something or selling something, and it costs them so much to do so. If they have to borrow a lot just to keep going, that may be a bad sign, just as it would be for a fa­ mily. And it will show up right in the annual report. 
If th ey ’re not selling as much as they’re making, that will show up, too. 
If they’re selling well, but other costs are cutting into profits, if s right there in black and white. That might mean bad management. 
Use your common sense. Weinstein says, and you can spot problem s or positive points in a corporation’s oper­ ations from a little careful reading.

Presses that print 2 colors at one time. 
And presses that print I color at one time. All told, 11 presses that can print anything you want, for just about any deadline.

Swearingen lands big sales 

Swearingen Aviation Corp. has announced major sales of its prop-jet aircraft to two different customers. 

Four Merlin IHA aircraft were purchased by the Army of the Republic of Argentina, which plans to use the planes as high-density personnel carriers. 

The aircraft will be built with nine forward-facing seats plus room for a two-man flight crew. 

The Merlin IHA Argentine Army sale follows an earlier announcement of the purchase of two Swearingen Merlin IVA m edical aircraft by the 
Argentine Air Force. 

Swearingen will deliver ail the Argentine m ilitary aircraft before the end of the year. 

Meanwhile, Southern Airways Inc. purchased seven Swearingen Metro II prop-jet aircraft to replace current piston aircraft in operation on the airline’s 14-state domestic route system. 

The 19-passenger, 3oo-mile-an-hour Metro II replaces Southern's Martin 
4o4 aircraft. Southern’s DCS fleet remains the airline’s primary carrier. 

The first Metro II is expected to be delivered in June and go into service in August, according to Southern officials. The equipment acquisition is still subject to arrangem ent of $7,75o,ooo in financiig. But a Southern spokesman said a substantial deposit had already been made on the purchase and no difficulty was expected in financing. 

Swearingen Aviation Corp. of San Antonio is a subsidiary of Fairchild 
Industries Inc. based in Germantown, Md. 
THIS Metro ll prop-jet is like the seven ordered by Southern Airways Inc.

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

NEW YORK —■ Firms trying to acquire their own energy sources were dominating the flood of corporate mergers in the past 12 weeks. 

“The whole exercise is to get your­ self oil and gas reserves, or nuclear reserves, but get yourself energy,” says L arry W achtel, un analyst at 
Bache Halsey Stuart Inc. 
And today's depressed stock market offers plenty of bargains for potential buyers, another reason given for the current surge in corporate mergers. 
“ I f s very expensive to build new plants. There has been a noticeable absence of capital spending expansion at this stage of the cycle,” Wachtel notes. 
“ And there has been a sharp m arket decline, so the big company that wants to expand looks around and finds ifs cheaper to buy a small company than build a new plant.” 

Mergers up 

In the first three months of 1977, the num ber of m ergers has increased 25 per cent over the com parable period last year, and the dollar value is up about 25 per cent, according to Victor 
Niederhoffer, of Niederhoffer Cross & 
Zeckhauser, m erger specialists. 

United Technologies C orp.’s half billion dollar offer recently to buy 
Babcock & Wilcox Co. is one of the most recent major examples of a large company trying to make an acquisi­ tion in the nuclear energy area. 

The takeover is turning into a bitter battle. B&W went to court to block the tender offer, and United, after the 
B&W directors rejected the bid, plans to take its offer direcily to B&W share­ holders. 

United, whose subsidiaries include 
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, Otis Eleva­ tor, Sikorsky Aircraft and Norden, de­ signs and m anufactures high techno­ logy products for industrial and go­ vernment markets. 

B&W, one of America’s oldest and largest producers of steam-generating 

 equipm ent, m akes coal-fired boilers and nuclear reactors. 
“ E nergy is ju st a really c ritic a l problem, in term s of cost and in term s of plain old supply,” agreed Steven 
Resnick, associate investment strate­ gist for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner 
& Smith Inc., the nation’s largest bro­ kerage house. 
Others 

Some other recent energy-related mergers include International Paper’s acquisition of Crude Oil; Union Paci­ fic’s takeover of Champlin Oil; and 
General E lectric’s purchase of Utah 
International Inc. and its oil, gas, coal and iron ore operations. 
In addition, the large oil companies, as expected, are trying to build up their reserves. 
Some large oil firm s, concerned about the depletion of oil and gas re­ serv es, are try in g a d ifferen t ap- proach-di versification. 
For example. Union Oil Co. of Cali­ fornia last week made an unsolicited offer for Molyeorp Inc., producers of molybdenum , a m etal used in steel alloys. 

More capital 

There is an abundance of capital to­ day, an o th er facto r th at m akes mergers more interesting. 
The money has accum ulated as a result of increased earnings in the past two years, and a reluctance to invest until the business recovery is m ore certain. 
“ Corporate liquidity is extrem ely high right now,” Merrill Lynch’s, Res­ nick added. 
“This means companies are feeling financially strong, and the banks also are extremely liquid. In a sense, there are not enough places to spend it.” 
But most of that money isn’t readily available to sm aller firms still trying to realize their potential. 
“ In a stable environm ent, no one would he afraid to own a small com­ pany,” Resnick said. “ But in today’s volatile econom y, only the strong, well-managed will survive.” 
As a result, m ergers are attractive to the small company, too, because the firm can do more financing under the umbrella of a larger business. 

DR. JOHN W. SHEEHAN 
THRON RIGGS 
Commonwealth gets two new officers 

Commonwealth Oil Refining Co.. Inc. last week named two new officers to senior posts in the company. 
Dr. John W. Sheehan, formerly vice president, manufacturing, for Shell Oil 
Co., joins Commonwealth as executive vice president while Thron Riggs becomes Commonwealth’s new senior vice president of operations. 
Dr. Sheehan retired recently from Shell following 3o years of service, starting at that company's Houston refinery in 1947. 
In 1974, he assumed responsibility for Shell Chemical Co.’s plant operations in addition to the parent company’s manufacturing operations. 
Dr. Sheehan holds bachelor’s and m aster's degrees in chemical engineering from Texas Tech University and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas. 
Thron Riggs, a Standard Oil Co. of California employe for 29 years, had been refinery general manager at that firm ’s El Segundo plant since 1971. 

Riggs holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the 
University of Washington and a m aster’s degree in business and engineering administration from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The people who manufacture copiers rate the speed of their machines by how fast they make many copies from one original. But. the people who use those machines, don't use them that way at all! Most people copy several originals at a time. The result is there’s a big difference between “ rated" time and “ real" time. That difference is the time wasted positioning originals, opening and closing covers, pushing buttons, waiting for each copy cycle to complete. etc., etc. 
The new Savin 78o plain paper copier lives up to its rating of 2o copies per minute. It gets it out as 

 fast as you can get it in. Our machine has a document feed that automatically positions and trans­ ports each original through the copier. There are no buttons to keep pushing, no covers to keep opening and closing — no shuffling of papers. 
The Xerox 31oo “ rated" at 2o copies per minute, the Xerox 4ooo 
“ rated" at 45 copies per minute and the Xerox 36oo “ rated" at 6o copies per minute in “ real" terms will on the average, copy only 5 different originals in a minute —and that's the real story on “ real" time! When you do multiple copies —the advantages of the Savin 78o multiply as well. 

The Savin 78o plain paper copier has a benefit of another sort. 

Paper handling devices have been available, as an option, for many years. With the Savin 78o, it’s standard. In addition, you don’t need expensive sorter attachments either. The Savin 78o not only makes clean, clear, needle sharp copies every time, but it returns originals and copies to you completely collated. 

Trade up to the new Savin 78o. today. You'll not only get more for your money —you'll spend much less to do it.

Word processing might be just what the doctor ordered for your company. However, by the time you add up the expenses for costly equipment, fancy typewriters and disruption in your office routine, it becomes a bitter pill to swallow. 

The Savin Word Master can put you into word processing effortlessly. In fact, your secretary already has half of the system right at her fingertips. Her electric typewriter. 

Connected to her typewriter, the Word Master allows your secretary to correct mistakes without erasing as she types her first and only draft. She can include your revisions, even your last minute changes without retyping the page. And, print out flawless final copy at 15o words per minute. 

The brains behind this operation is the Word 
Master’s buffer memory, and the magnetic tape cassette that records whatever is typed as it’s typed. This system enables the Word Master to accommodate additional words, and sentences 

 within previously recorded material. And to 
“ forget" anything you wish deleted without losing track of the rest of the manuscript. 

Your secretary can build up her own tape library of perfectly typed letters, memos, contracts and other items you’re likely to use more than once. 
Each cassette stores up to 24 pages of typewritten information. And, unlike the so-called memory typewriters with limited recall, the Word 
Master’s memory is endless. No material has to be erased to make room for new material: your secretary simply starts a new tape. 

Call us for a demonstration. W e ’ll show you how you can enjoy the advantages of word processing, inexpensively, in your organization without reorganization.

TV NEWS IMAGE 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sunday May I 1977 

Continued from Page IG 

Channel 12 was smart in coming to an agency. Television stations are not in the business of making television commercials. 
“ Their business is putting on pro­ gramming and production is a side­ line. They have no time for it and the work needs an outside, objective look.- 
How can an employe say ‘That’s a bad idea’ to his boss on something like this?” 
Anderson supports his contention by noting KMOL-TV now has hired the 
Pitluk Group agency to produce its news promotion campaign . 
So, armed with an approved ap­ proach and aware of the competition, 
Anderson and his account executives huddled with Hayes and his production staff to define arid polish the image of the new team at 12. 
It was decided that posterization — line sketches of photos — would be more effective in presenting a serious attitude than actual photographs of 
Don Colson, Karen Wilson, et a1. 
Earlier campaign 
But why that would be better was only an impression of Anderson's based on an earlier campaign for the 
Alcohol Safety Action Program’s ad blitz against drunk drivers. 
“ I don’t think there is anywhere I could go back in the creative process and point to one place that made me feel the need for that. 
“ I guess it was just instinct or a gut feeling — although I sure don’t like that term because it implies uncer­ tainty,” he said. 
The visual effect w'as to be quick moving, to give impressions and. above all, to convey seriousness. 
New oil field found 

A new oil field discovery in Wilson 
County has been announced by Barber 
Oil Exploration of Houston. 
The field has opened a Buda for­ mation oil play IO miles southwest of 
Floresville and gauged 181 barrels a day of oil and 17,ooo cubic feet of gas. 
The oil was reached at a depth of between 7,138 and 7,174 feet although the well itself was sunk to 7,22o feet. 
The discovery location was in a 
2o3-acre site identified as the No. I 
Houston. 
This is the first Buda formation production in the area, say company officials. The nearby McClain field, pumping from the Austin Chalk for­ mation, was opened a year ago two miles south of the Sutil Buda field discovered by Tesoro Petroleum Co. in 
1976. 
The new discovery brings to more than IO the number of operators in the area with drilling programs.

CHUCK ANDERSON 

“ Hayes used a process called ‘gra­ phic animation’ sort of like how' a car­ toon is filmed. You place the drawing down, shoot it, move it slightly and shoot it again. Only we used stark line posterizations instead.” 
One important aspect, Anderson said, was that the promotions had to have a connection with the news program via the music and opening visual effect. This was something all other local stations failed to do. 
“ You must develop that link. How can you sell a can of peas in a super­ market if your audience doesn’t know what the can’s label looks like?” 
An added problem was the five-man creative staff of Anderson Advertising was given only IO days to hand Schia- vone the finished product. The process normally takes about three weeks. 
12 symbolic days 
This was a limitation they put upon themselves by suggesting a 12-day countdown (symbolic of Channel 12) to 
Colson’s premiere. 
When completed, video tape master copies of station identifications, pro­ motions and news opening and clos­ ings, featuring each member of the 
New'swatch team, were given to Chan­ nel 12. The original film stayed with 
Anderson. 
The price tag? Anderson hesitated to reveal the exact cost because of con­ tractual agreements and competition w ith other San Antonio agencies. 
He admitted, though, that Channel 
12’s bill totaled between $5,ooo and 
$8,ooo for the entire project. The agency walks away with 15 per cent. 
Hit 'em again 

The success of Anderson’s efforts can be seen in ratings, revenues and, in another measure of success, Chan­ nel 12 returned to the agency six months later for a follow-up campaign. 
Re-emphasizing Channel 12’s ser­ iousness and playing up dedication, the follow-up has Colson and others mus­ ing philosophically on the role of a television newsman. 
MOLY OIL 

Continued from Page IG 

 drain oil (requiring changing only after an extended period of time). 
“ A product in the crankcase can only hold so much junk,” he said, “ and if the moly doesn’t burn off. it might cause sticking of the rings if the car engine burns a lot of oil.” 
Moly backers maintain the oil is not a panacea for automotive ills but mer­ ely a better lubricant. They also re­ commend a filter change at least once a year. 
Sweeley’s main argument, however, is that the car manufacturers of today do not approve of long drain oils — 
Moly Oil, Mobil I synthetic oil or whatever — in their new cars. 
Fighting it 

“ The manufacturers are fighting it. 
Their position is if you run the car beyond the recommended drain inter­ val, the car's warranty is voided,” he said. 
“ When GM says drain at 7,5oo miles, that’s what they mean.” 
When asked if a I per cent solut ion of moly would really benefit a car owner enough to buy this new type of oil, 
Sweeley indicated more study was needed. 
“ It’s a toss up. One per cent is really infinitesmal and that’s the key,” he said. “ The figures we’ve been given here at the Amalie lab from Climax 
Molys Co. (the company that markets the product to International Molyb­ denum Corp. which, in turn, owns Mo­ ly Oil of San Antonio! is that it takes more than I per cent to really be ef­ fective in reducing friction. 

“ The reason they are using that percentage is that you have trouble keeping anything more in suspension in a motor oil,” he said. 

Retail price 

The retail price was also a handicap, he noted. 

“ Long drain oils, whoever makes them, are too expensive right now. I can go out and buy three oil changes for the price of one quart of Moly Oil. 

“ It’s a vicious circle. You have to get 
75,ooo miles out of it to make it worth it and it can’t be done with today’s auto­ mobiles.” 

But there is the future, Sweeley said. 
“ It will come. It is the way the in­ dustry is going. But it will take a little longer than tomorrow.” 

Most of Sweeley’s comments were supported by Charles Reass of Exxon’s 
Houston technical sales department. 

“ This (mileage until drain) is the sort of thing you have to support with exact lab data before you market rather than grandiose discription,” he noted. 

“ If it is ever proven, though, the car manufacturers will jump at it, quickly suggesting a sealed crankcase which would save them money and probably increase sales.” 

Definite boon 

Reass agreed such an oil would be a definite boon to fuel conservation both in terms of gasoline consumption and decreased oil usage and added Exxon had a similar product presently on the market for diesel operators. 

“ We term it our 5o,ooo-mile oil,” he explained. “ There’s no big baloney about it. It sells for about $1 a quart, has a high additive treatment and is designed for diesel operation. 

“ For gasoline operation, our present unit oil will go the full amount shown in a car’s owners manual under diffi­ cult conditions to as much as 1o,ooo miles,” he said. 

“ Next year maybe we’U move that figure up. We’re working on it.” 

“ We test and sell a lot of lubri­ cants,” said Amalie’s Sweeley. “ If we could sell exotic oils at a price like 
Moly of San Antonio is selling and do better performancewise than we are doing now with our current products, we would definitely be in the market. 

“ But the fact is the industry is not ready for long drain oils,” he said. 
Reass agreed. “ It has a potential for trouble,” he said. 

Graham of Moly Oils of San Antonio points to the fact his product meets or exceeds performance requirements of such prestigious firms as Caterpillar, 
General Motors Corp., International 
Harvester Co. and Mack Trucks and the Society of Automotive Engineers 
(S.A.E.) as support for his product. 

Up to public 

But whether molybdenum-enhanced oil — or any . long drain oil — will be an answer to the rising cost of fuel or, as the other oil companies say, is a source of potential trouble, depends to a large extent on acceptance of the product by the general public. 
And that, as the Amalie technical manager said, is still in the future.

The Colson spots open with the fa- p iiliar commanding voice saying. 
“ Perhaps more than any other man in our city’s history. Don Colson has changed the way we look at news.” 
Cut to shots of Colson, in shirt sleeves with his tic loosened, saying. 
“ News happens because of people. 
People make the news.” 
But aren’t those statements pretty overblown? Anderson explained: 
“ Of course ifs obvious but the peo­ ple out there don’t realize that. 

“ And it sells.” he added with a grin. 
Sehiavone thinks so and has the fi­ gures to back it up. 
“ From third place, we are now m>ck and neck with Channel 5, the previous leader in San Antonio and even ahead in certain newscasts," the television executive said. 
“ Naturally revenues go with and are a function of the ratings.” 
He confirmed a 3o-second commer­ cial. which before the ad campaign had cost about $2oo, now goes for twice that. 
Both advertising agency director and television general manager, however, maintain the media campaign is only a hook to attract the viewers. 
Ask Edsel 

“ Advertising contributed signifi­ cantly to getting people to tune into 
Channel 12 but viewers would not have stayed more than one time if the pro­ duct had not been what we told them it would be,” Anderson said. 
“ If you doubt me, ask Edsel.”

By WILLIAM “ FISHBAIT" 
MILLER as told lo FRANCES SPATZ 
LEIGHTON 

C opyright 1977 by W illiam M oseley Millet and frances Spat* 
Leighton Reprinted by permission of Prentice Hall Inc 
Sol Bloom, the New York 
Congressman, used to say: 
“ Fish, some day someone’s going to do a musical about you and your life here on the Hill. The only trouble is that Gilbert and Sullivan may have already written the theme song when they wrote TI.M.S. Pinafore.’ It goes something like this: T washed the windows and I swept the floor and I po­ lished up the handle of the big front door. I polished up the handle so carefully that now' I am the ruler of the 
Queen's navee.’’’ 
I'll admit it was some kind of miracle that a character with a nicknam e of Fish ba i I from a town called Pascagoula ever got to Washington, let alone to rose to the important post of door­ keeper of the House of Repre­ sentatives of the United States, with a salary that topped $4o,oo1) and an empire of 357 emplaces with a $3 million budget. 

Well. I'm oui now. relict ■ ]. kicked out or voted out. if you please, aller -L' y ears on Capitol Hill. 28 of them a* the doorkeeper. Aud while ii is all vividly clear iii m ind. I'm ready to give you the true, unvarnished picture of life as it is lived on Capitol Hill. It s not the sa m e as the sw eet little new sletter Ilia! gets m ailed to constituents back home. 
And it is the truth , so help me God. to the best of m y ability. 
I’ve known seven presidents 
— 
Roosevelt, T ru m a n . Eisenhow er. Ken­ nedy, Johnson. Nixon and bord — and. to m e. LBJ was the most interesting. 
T h a t’s because he was the hardest to figure out — was he d u m b or foxy? 

Remember when LBJ showed everyone the sear from his gall b lad ­ der operati'Mi? No one could figure out why lie was anxious to have it shown. It was crude everyone said. On the Mill. v\e had the inside story, told by a doc­ tor Lyndon hod ask ed him , “ Could th is s e a r be a n y t h i n g but for g a ll bladder? lf people thought you had an exploratory operation for cancer, could th ey th in k th is w as a c a n c e r operation s c a r ? ” 
“ H a rd ly ,” the do cto r had replied. 
“ It is a classic gall bladder s c a r .” So 
L B J ju s t w a n te d to h av e e v e ry o n e know it w asn 't c a n c e r that had sent him to tin* hospital. 
How’s that for foxy? 

 liney Long, the political boss of Lo­ uisiana. was a m ost disruptive force in the Senate. But he was a fantastically c o lo r fu l t a l k e r , u s i n g all k in d s of 
S ou thern ex p ressio n s. W hen he was g o in g to m a k e a s p e e c h , th e w ord would be flashed up and down the halls and anyone who had tim e would rush to the galleries of the O ther Body just to listen lo him. Secretaries on the Hill adored him as he railed against FDR or hankers rich enough to “ burn a wet m u le .” liney Long had an unfortunate way of ex pressing him self when displeased or in his cups — like a dog, he would p o in t a n d u r i n a t e . O n c e , in th e m e m b e rs ’ m e n ’s room , he pretended to m iss his m a rk in the urinal and hit another Senator with whom he’d been having w ords a short tim e before. The v ic tim trie d to slu g h im . bul liney fended off his blow with one hand and walked out laughing.

First in a series 

There is a little known room on the Hill. T he P ra y e r Room. If a con­ g ressm a n is deeply upset or even just in need of guidance from his own heart and mind, he may go there and sit in silent meditation. As a joke. Elizabeth 
Ra\ has said that she thought of using the room for o ther purposes. I'm a l­ most s u r e she w ould not have been caught. loan aud W alter M andate both had m inisters for fathers. But on the Hill they were fun people as well as being serious In fact. I have been told there is a big painting in their home over the fireplace which shows Joan as Cleopa­ tra and F ritz Mondale as C aesar with the caption: “ All Hail. M ondale.” 
C ongressm en have the best medical c are money will buy and all the free m edicines and vitam in pills they c a re to indulge in. They have a heart sp e­ cialist standing by at all times. E very expensive medical gadget is available to them in the Hill m edical office, in­ cluding an electric therm o m eter. 
One congressm an m ad e so m uch of the good deal that he would send his aide to the m edical office to “ pick up a package that will be waiting fur you." 
The aide thought it was som e kind of medical stuff. It was tissues the con­ g r e s s m a n 's wife had phoned him to get. 
A nonprofit research group, the Tax 
Fniimkithgi. recently figured out that it now costs alm o st a billion d o llars a year to keep C ongress in business — 
$923 million in the last fiscal year and still rising. 

When I came to W ashington to work for Congress in 1933. a congress­ m a n 's salary was $1o,ooo. In the 196os, it went to $22,5oo. and when I left it was 
$42,5oo. As I w rite this book, it is 
$44,6oo. 
The basic salary is only part of w hat a co n g ressm an really m akes. T here is a $3,ooo tax deduction as a consolation 

 prize for living away from one’s hom e district. 
Then there are travel costs. I used to a sk f r ie n d s who w o n d e r e d w h at it would be like to be a c o n g re s s m a n , how would you like to g et 12 cents a m ile for 18 trips hom e each year, or a lum p sum of $4,3oo? You doggone but­ cha. som e took the m oney and ran. It really pays to run for C ongress from a sta te close to W ashington. D.C. 
At this writing, each individual con­ g ressm a n gets up to 18 helpers, if he w ants them all. He has a $238,5oo staff allow ance and decides w hat he will pay each employe. 
Even ex-congressm en get so m any ben efits for having been in the Con­ g re s s that one of th em actually co m ­ plained. 
“ It is becom ing scand a­ lous.” That was form er Rep. H astings 
K eith, a stra ig h t arrow from M a ssa ­ chusetts who c am e back to testify that his pension from the Hill had increased in two y e a rs from $1,56o lo $2,o95 a m o n th . Ile w arned th at if C o n g ress d id n ’t elim inate its g en ero u s cost-of- living increases, he personally would be getting $6,ooo per m onth by 199o. 

Through the years, v a r i o u s c o n g re s sm e n have m a n a g e d to c o m ­ bine “ B and F ” — boozing and floozy- ing — as it is called in the backroom s of Congress, without a speck of dust oil t h e i r p u b lic r e p u t a t i o n s . B ut th e s ta f f e r s know w hat is g o in g on and d o n 't m in d s h a rin g th e d e ta ils with th e ir friends in other Hill offices. 
G irls in v ario u s offices a re given v ario u s labels — a “ g ra s s m o n k e y ,” for exam ple, is a girl who w ill oblige a c o n g re s s m a n or s e n a to r behind any bush or nice spot w here they can find a bit of privacy. 
T he powerful have hideaw ays in lit­ tle known room s of the Capitol or office buildings. Three co ng ressm en have an a p a rtm e n t they share for daytim e use n e a r the U.S. Capitol. W hen I was a beginner on the Hill and a bachelor, a certain m an would send m e to a movie sev eral tim es a week and dem and my a p a rtm e n t key. Even now, we w hen we m eet, the guy says, “ Hey, Fish, have you seen any good mov ies lately?” 
One of the g re atest w o m an ize rs in h isto ry on Capitol Hill w as S p e ak er 
N ich o las L ongw orth, w ho is b est r e ­ m e m b e re d today for hav in g m a rrie d th e d a u g h t e r of P r e s i d e n t T e d d y 
Roosevelt. Up on the Hill they are still te llin g N icholas L o n g w o rth ’s a d v e n ­ tures as a lady’s m an. 
T he story goes that the spe ak er was s i t t i n g in th e H o u se flo o r l i b r a r y , read in g a Cincinnati new spap er from back home when a brash con gressm an thought he'd m ake a splash by putting down Longworth on his w om anizing. 
“ Mr. S p eaker.” he said, “ your p re t­ ty bald head rem inds m e of my wife s behind. Its it all right if I rub my hand across it? Then I II be s u r e ." 

Without waiting for an answ er, he went ahead and rubbed his hand all the way across Lungwort b ’s bald head and said, “ Yes, it does feel ju st like my w ife's behind.” 
He looked around a bit sm ugly and w aited for Longworth to explode. But he d id n ’t. Longworth lifted his own hand and ran it acro ss his own head th o u g h tfu lly . “ I ’ll be d a m n e d if it d o e sn 't,” he said. 

Nick and Alice Roosevelt Longworth p r e t ty m u c h w e n t th e i r own w ays. 
They would go to parties together but com e home separately and Nick might not go directly home, it w as one of the original open m arriag es. 
F r a n k B o y k in , a D e m o c ra t fro m 
A lab am a and one of the richest men ever to walk the halls of Congress, is now dead. But if money can do it. bt' is still probably c asin g Capitol Hill for p r e t ty g i r l s fro m so m e c o n v e n ie n t heavenly cloud. 
F ran k, a veritable giant of a m an in several ways. drove us all crazy for years going around the 
Capitol booming, “ Everything is m ade for love!” 
Well, he certainly seem ed lo think he w as. His sp e ciality was to have two p re tty g ir ls in bed w ith him at the s a m e tim e. O nce he thought he had nicely shipped hom e a close relative with a kiss and a wave. but the plane was grounded and she return ed to the hotel w here they w ere staying, w alking iii on a ra r e scene of nudity and lewdi- ty. 
All persons involved, including the naked g irls, c a rrie d off the situation with great dignity and politeness, d is­ cussing everything but what was going on — which by this tim e was that th e y w e re s c r a m b l i n g in to th e i r clothes. F ran k told me about his wild a d v e n t u r e a n d la u g h e d at b e in g caught. Then he pointed proudly to his favorite d eco ratio n, a dried elephant penis which hung from an wire on his o ffic e w a ll, an d a d d e d , “ A n y th in g goes, F ishbait. Ju s t as long as som e m ean old new sm an doesn’t get hold of it. th e re’s no h arm done." 

Brother Boykin was the m ost sen su o u s m an in the House. Ile was a lw a y s g r a b b i n g an d to u c h in g an d h u g g in g —■ a n d he w a n te d to be touched in return.

Boykin w as known for another little habit. He would leave the floor of the co m m itte e m ee tin g su ddenly and go across the street to the Congressional 
Hotel Then he’d com e hack happy as a lark and not c a re who heard him say 
“ a sex break beats a coffee break, any tim e .” Som e of the other men envied old F ran k a little. 
Everyone around the Hill wondered how J o h n E. K e n n e d y c o u ld be a sw in g er when lie hobbled arou nd on crutches m uch of the tim e because of that back trouble datin g from the old 
PT-boat days of World W ar ll 
In his office, when his back was bad but Ins passion was w orse. C ongressm an K en­ nedy and then S e n a to r K ennedy was known to use the hard surface of the floor with just the padding of the rug under him ra th e r than the couch. As som e of his buddies put it. “ Ile lets the girl do all the w o rk.” 
W ayne H ays w as a n o th e r a c k n o w ­ le d g e d g i r l - c h a s e r , a lw a y s ta lk in g about his great goal — to lie shot at, b ut m is s e d , at a g e 9o. by a .jealous husband. IR' would greet pretty young things around the Hill with a big hello and a handshake. He would say. “ Hi. 
I’m Dr. W ayne Hays. D D. — Doctor of the D ivan.” 
Som e lives on flu* Hill would m ak e good soap operas. 
After the sex s c a n d a ls of 1976 sta rted to break, the public suddenly b e c a m e v e ry i n t e r e s t e d in th e h i­ deaw ay room s on the Hill. The most im portant hideaway on the House side 

 is c a lle d th e " B o a r d of E d u c a tio n 
R o o m .” b e lo n g i n g , a s a p e r k , to w h o m e v e r is S p e a k e r of th e House 
W hen n e w s p a p e rs h in te d th a t th e re m ight he drinking and sexual dalliance g oin g on th e re, recent S p e a k e r Carl 
Albert hurriedly called i i i all the keys he had passed out to those he p e rm it­ ted to share his hideaway. 
T h e m a n who w as k now n to h ave m ad e the best use of that room was fo rm e r Sp eaker Joh n N an ce G a rn e r, one of the most determ ined boozers the 
Capitol lias ever known. His routine. I w as told, w as to m otion for c e rta in cronies oil the floor to com e up to the 
S peaker s stand near ad jou rnm en t al­ most every day. and he would say: 
“ Boys, it s alm ost 5 o ’clock. L td’s get this House adjourned so you fellows can loud m e down the step s (he was known also to take a snifter to help him th ro u g h th e d a y ). And on the w ay, after the first landing, let m e stick my finger i i i the m outh o f m y pet snake and see if h e ’ll bite m e this afternoon 
B ecause if lie does, as he has in the past, I will be in need of the cure and we ll have to go to the Board of E d u ­ cation Room and take cart* of the si­ tuation p ronto." 
The room, incidentally, is historic: i ii the c a rcer of Marry T ru m a n , because that is w here he first learned that the

In fact it was R ayburn who actually took the call from E leanor Roosevelt, w hich w as m e re ly th at T ru m a n was needed righ t away at the W hite House. 
T ru m a n d id n ’t know it, but he arrived at the Board of Education Room as a vice p resid ent an d left it as a p re s i­ dent. because EDR had died at his own little hideaway at W arm Springs, Ga.

Fishbait 9s lawmakers! telling on you 

Who drank? Who didn’t? What of Wil­ bur Mills? Wayne Hays? 
Who were the great womanizers? 
Who lived like kings on Capitol Hill? 
Who were sadistic? Who said words so cruel he caused a congressional colleague to fall dead as he left the floor of the

Who were called “the Five Sisters” for their religious ardor? And speaking of sisters, how angelic are the women in

AI! this will be answered in this ulti­ mate look at life as it is truly lived on 

Capitol Hill, as seen through the eyes of 
Fishbait Miller. So well known is this former Doorkeeper to the general public, who heard him intone, “ Mistah Speakah, the President of the United States,” that mail addressed simply to “ Fishbait, Wa­ shington, D.C.” had no trouble coming directly to him. 
His material is fantastic. Inside stories on the men who run the country. Inside stories on the presidents he knew before they were presidents. His stories may not blow the dome of the Capitol, but they should tilt it a little.

Smilin9 Roy Blake runs the legislative graveyard 

By LEE JONES 

ASSOCIATED PW SS 

AUSTIN — There’s a story, possibly apocryphal, about a chairman of the House Calen­ dars Com m ittee when the 
T exas L egislature was an earthier place. 

Ile d esp ised a bill th a t had reached his com m ittee. Someone asked what he would do with it. He took the official copy of the bill to the nearest restroom, tore it into tiny pieces, dropped it into the toilet and flushed it. 
* That's what,” he said. 
. 
Nobody could get away with that iii the computerized House today. 

 but the calendars committee is still a g ra v e y a rd for bills. And new tom bstones sprout daily as tim e runs out for the session. 

Most people think a bill is headed for the floor once a House “ s u b ­ stantive com mittee” has cleared it. 
But they're wrong. It goes to the calendars committee. From there it might or might not go on a daily calendar for House debate. 
“ Right now, we’ve got about 3oo bills — not counting the local and uncontested ones. . . . Obviously a lot of bills are going to die there. We d o n ’t have enough d a y s .” said c h a irm a n Roy B lake, a N a c o g ­ doches insurance agent

Blake said it’s “ got coon hunters, dog train ers and squirrel hunters upset” and the sponsor won’t nar­ row it. 
“ I hope it stays in calendars for­ ever!” he said. 
And it probably will. 
“ In adopting the rules, the House did give the calendars com mittee a great deal of power. It m eans we can choose and pick what we want to set,” Blake said. 
Blake, 48. accuses other com m it­ tees of ducking tough issu es by 

 passing out bills and expecting his nine-member panel to do the killing for them. 

I’ve had m em bers tell me, 
I ve got a till down there, but I don't want it set.’. . I like that kind. 
I tell them we can take care of that request. If you are opposed to a bill, what better position can you be in than to be the sponsor.” Blake said. 
Blake smiles a lot and spends m uch of his tim e on th e floor, slouching about with his hands in his pockets and making jokes with other representatives. He doesn't let the pressure of his job bother 

 him. or seems not to. 
Does it help to be able to say no? 
“ Sure does.” he said. 
“ Fifteen cam e by my desk this morning wanting bills set. Then, when I get to my office, the lobby comes around. I ask. ‘Where s the m em ber?’ They say. The m em bers say they’ll carry them (bills) on the floor but it's up to us to get them through committee.’ ” Blake said. 
Blake admits that when there are so many bills and so little time, his committee's feelings about a m ea­ s u re or its sp o n so r can d ec id e whether it reaches the floor. 
“ We are not su p p o sed to consider bills on their merits but we are all human. We can't help but consider who’s carrying the bill,” he said. 

But there is su rp risin g ly little criticism of the com mittee for a r ­ bitrariness, partly because each member gets one priority bill that must come to the floor if it reaches the calendars committee. 
Speaker Bill Clayton, like his predecessors, selected the com m it­ tee from those he could count on to go along with him in guaranteeing action — at the strategically right time — on bills he deem s im p o r­ tant. 
Blake says he goes along only so far. however, with the notion his panel is a “speaker’s com m ittee." 
“ A m e m b e r ca m e to m e th is m orning and said. ‘The sp e a k e r said set this bill.’ I told him, ‘The speaker is not a m em b er of this c o m m itte e .’”

Now there’s gratitude 

There were those who said City Councilman Phil Pyndus wouldn't get re-elected this year. And boy,were they wrong. Pyndus is so grateful that he's buying $4oo worth of benches — 25 of them — in his northwest District 8 just to thank voters. In all fairness to Phil, whose fiscal conservatism makes Jack Benny look open-handed, the post-election expenditure didn’t come easily. Reports were that campaign manager 
Dorothy Doehne and aides had to do a little fast talking to get Pyndus to okay the expense.

The author of the bestseller, The Godfather, tells why Las Ie gas is a Disneyland for adults 

By MARIO PUZO 

The sailing of the Mayflower to colonize the New World was financed by a lottery in E ng­ land. So much for our Puritan heritage. 

Ono of the Twelve Apostles was cho­ sen by lot or lottery. Hut it wasn't J u ­ das. George Washington never told a lie but he gam bled on anything, any­ place, anytime. 

These facts are cited merely to show that gam bling is not an unnatural vice and that the city of Las Vegas is per­ haps the best known city in the entire world. It is also the best place to lose your money. 

Las Vegas itself is the big bet won, the m iracle happening. An act of faith. 
There is no reason for Las Vegas to exist out there alone in the vast desert of Nevada. But with its billions of watts of neon light it is a Mecca for countless people from all corners of the globe. 
For Vegas is unique in its gam bling 24 hours a day. If you like to gamble, really like to gamble, Vegas is the es­ sence. 

On a three-dav visit to Vegas you can have one of the best times of your life. 
To do that you have to forget about great museums, the pleasure of read­ ing, great theater, great m usic, sti­ m u la tin g le c tu re s by g r e a t p h ilo ­ sophers, great food, g rea t wine and true love. Forget about them. Just for three days. Believe me, you won’t miss them . Ye shall be as little children again. 

I love Las Vegas but I must tell you that you cannot wind up a winner there over any period of time. It’s just that the house percentage or “ edge” cannot be beaten by an honest player. Not because casinos are dis­ honest. 
They are the first honest gam ing establishm ents in the history of c iv iliz a tio n , and g a m b lin g has existed since the recorded history of man. 

Sure, you m ay win on some trips. 

You may win five, six or seven trips in a r o w .'But ev en tu ally you will get wiped out. Remember, a losing streak is benevolent. And that’s all you have to know about gambling in Vegas. 
R e m e m b er that 3o y e a rs ago Las 
Vegas w as a sm all town with a few 
Western-style casinos you could break with a 5o-grand win. It is now a city with a billion-dollar gam bling plant of luxury hotels which generates close to 
$2 b illio n in w in n in g s a y e a r. R e­ m em ber always: the money to build th a t b illio n -d o llar g a m b lin g p lan t cam e from losers. 

 gam blers want to lose to punish them ­ selves. Sure, som e do. Some people like to ju m p off th e E m p ir e S tate 
Building. But millions go up to look at the view. 
What is true is that there are guys who can win 5o or a hundred grand and not stop gam bling and then wind up losing. They are known almost affec­ tionately as degenerate g am blers. I was one on a sm a ll sc a le . (I once walked out of a Vegas gam bling casino with IO grand cash.) My biggest win was $3o,ooo in baccarat but that didn’t co u n t b e c a u s e I owed th e hotel m arkers so I just traded the cash in for my IOUs. 

But in my very worst days I was only a m ild ly d e g e n e ra te g a m b le r which gives me an understanding, I think, of the syndrome. It’s not that you want to lose what you have won. 
It’s just that you cannot believe i f s possible to lose. When winning you are convinced God loves you. You are con­ vinced that some inner vision enables you to pick those num bers that were about to appear magically as the red 

Nearly everything I have ever read or been told about why people gam ble is just bull. Some psychiatrists claim th a t g am b lin g is m aso ch istic, that dice cam e to a stop, as a dealer un­ locked a blue-backed card. 
A winning streak inspires a belief in your own infallibility. Why stop then? 
Also, what non-gamblers do not know is the feeling of virtue (th ere is no other word to describe it) when the dice roll as one commands. And that om niscient goodness when the card you need rises to the top of the deck to g re e t y o u r d elig h ted yet confident 

 poker with very tough working men beneath lam p posts in the streets of 
New York or in the backs of the local ca n d y sto re s . F la y in g with local strong-arm punks and nickel-and-dime stickup artists, I had the infantile au­ d ac ity to ch e at. I d ea lt the ace of spades from the bottom of the deck: I stacked the cards, I went “ light” in the stud poker game. 

I was an unskillful cheat. A simple cut would ruin my stacked deck but 
“ forget” to offer the cards to bt* cut. 
My age placed m e above suspicion. 
L ater when I taught my children to play poker I never let them deal out the cards without cutting the deck. You can't trust kid gamblers. 
All parents should teach their chil­ dren card gam es mainly because they a r e a g re a t p r e p a ra tio n for th e disappointm ents of life. Once a child has drawn to an inside straight and missed, he will understand that life is not all peaches and cream . And when that sam e child loses a sure-fire pot with a pat hand he will understand that the future is full of nasty surprises. 

 eyes. It is as close as I ha\e ever come in my life to a religious feeling. Or to being a wonder-struck child. 
In my childhood I squeezed in a lot of card playing while becoming a sports hero on T enth Avenue and read in g

You have to be more careful when you are innocent than when you are guilty. I spent nearly four years in the w artim e arm y arid never fired a shot in anger. But I dealt a million hands of cards. 

It is possible to develop a better ch aracter through gam bling. H ere’s how it works. In the heat of gam bling you co m m it dishonest, trea so n ab le acts. You betray the trust people have in you. You fail to fulfill obligations to those nearest and dearest to you. Then you feel so dam n lousy about having done th ese th in g s that you refo rm sooner or later (mostly later) and try to wash away your guilt by behaving honorably in ail sorts of human situa­ tions. Or at least you try not to ever do that kind of thing again.

Las Vegas fever!!! 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sunday May I 1977 

 when I took my oldest kid to the Polo 
Grounds to watch the Giants play the 
Dodgers. The Giants won and my son and I were both overjoyed. My emotion was less pure than his. I had the Giants, bet in a three-way parlay. 

As we w alked on the deep g reen playing field toward the exit, part of a h appy th ro n g , I looked up at the scoreboard and saw that all my bets had won. I had made nearly a thou­ sand dollars, a fortune for me in the 
Tills. I wouldn’t have to borrow money to buy clothes for my kiddies when they started school in the autumn. I did not gam ble that money away. I was not a degenerate gambler. 
One time I had to move my family lo 

 the Bronx into a new housing project, 
It cost $85 to move. I only had $2(1. I bet the $2(1 on a baseball parlay laking two u n d erd o g s with big odds. I won. I d id n ’t have to borrow the m oney, I kept my pride. 
W hat if I had lost? Well, then I’d borrow. But I was no worse off than before. My creditor would be worse off since I would have to borrow $85 rather than $85. And that’s how a gam b ler’s mind works.

By KEMPER DIEHL 
General William ll. Simpson is winning what he frankly describes as the toughest battle of his long career as a fighting man. 
That is quite a statement — coming as it does from the lanky Texan who led the Ninth Army across the Rhine, through the great Ruhr Valiev to the banks of the Elbe River just 8(1 miles from Berlin. 
For nearly six months, starting last 
September, the general was virtually im m obilized, first by phlebitis, and then by neuritis. 
Much of the tim e he suffered from excruciating pain. 
“ I f s one of the worst battles I’ve ever had to fight,” recalls the World 
War II com m ander whose arm y cap­ tured m ore than 3oo,ooo G erm a n s. 
“ The rest were pretty easy to win.” 
Sitting with his legs propped up on a chair in his Monger Hotel suite, the general, who will be 89 in a few days, adds ruefully: 
“ I almost had to retreat.” 

The general’s grim campaign against illness began last Septem ber 
13 while he was visiting his daughter and her family in Fairbanks, Alaska. 
Ile w as h o sp italized with se v ere phlebitis and then evacuated by air iii stages that took him to A nchorage, then to Travis AFB in California, and finally to Kelly AFB here on October 
12. 
The general was carried from the plane on a s tr e t c h e r and ta k en to 
Brooke General Hospital where he re­ mained until Nov. 29. 
But just two days after his return to the Monger, he suffered an onslaught of neuritis that kept him confined in his room until mid-March. 
It was d u r in g this tim e — when drugs brought no relief — that Simp­ son found help from the life of one of his predecessors in the “ Long Gray 
Line” at West Point. 
“ I was in such pain that I couldn't sleep and this book saved m e,” he re­ lates. gesturing to a life of Gen. Robert 

E. Lee written some St) years ago by 
Sir Frederick Maurice. 
“ I’d get so interested in Lee that I could get my mind off my trouble.” 

Sometime in February physi­ cians from Brooke were able to p re­ scribe the medication that started the general on the road to recovery. 
About six weeks ago, he began a th e ra p e u tic ex ercise p ro g ra m with 
SPC Louis Erkfitz of Brooke. 
T h is w eek th e g e n e r a l has been com pleting 12 exercises daily in ses­ sions that last more than two hours. 
Each week another exercise is added to the program. Simpson explains: 
“ When I get to 18, the sergeant says 
I’ll be able to dance and jog! But if I can walk without a cane Til be happy.” 
Even moving with the aid of a cane, however, the general is im m ersed in a rem arkable round of activity from the tim e he rises at 8:3o a.m . until late evening. 

On one recent day for example, he began with his exercise session, then observed a M arine Corps drill team perform on Alamo Plaza, lun­ ched with a group of friends, talked at length with a reporter and worked on some military matters. 
Not surprisingly, Simpson is still a so u rc e of counsel for a n u m b e r of ran k in g officers. His re c o m m e n d a ­ tions to promotion boards and to the 
Military Academy carry solid weight. 
T hroughout the day the g e n e ra l’s conversation ranged over a vast span of topics — from recollections of riding a horse to a two-teacher school in the 
189os to discussions of recent military developments. 
If his appraisals of military m atters som etim es carried a bite, it was be­ cause he remains a dedicated career officer an d feels deeply about the 
United .States and its defense posture. 
At the sam e time he m akes it clear that he defers to the decisions of the 
President as com mander in chief. 
One of the things disturbing Simpson is the apparent gain of the m ilitary potential of the Soviet Union as com ­ pared with the United States. 

GEN. WILLIAM H. SIMPSON 

Simpson displays some of his mementos . . . a portrait of himself and a mug with the face of Monty — Field 
Marshal Montgomery 

He refers to recent speeches of 
Gen. Lewis W. Walt, the retired M ar­ ine Corps com m ander who has been w arning that Russia is building the greatest military force in history and is capable of taking Western Europe in two weeks. 
“ I ’m frig h ten e d about the s it u a ­ tion,” he says. 
Simpson is a graduate of the Class of 
19o9 of the U.S. Military Academy — only 14 West Point graduates are older. 
Naturally he has an opinion on the a r ­ rival of women cad ets at his alm a mater. 
“ I’m not too strong on women being there,” he says, arguing that the Point should limit itself to training combat officers. He observes: 
“ lf we can’t take care of our women without putting them in the front lines, something is wrong with us.” 
Lunch with the general is a delight. 
One re c e n t noon he w as at th e 
M enger’s Patio Club with Dr. lluber- tus Strughold, the retired space scien­ tist, and several World War II veter­ ans. 
T he g en e ral o rd ered his favorite fruit plate and asked the chef, Guido 
DePhillips, to pull up a chair and join the conversation. 

DePhillips was an arm y mess sergeant for five years in World War II and is a g ra d u a te of the cooks and bakers school — a fact that seems to im p re ss the g en e ral m ore than the chef’s long experience in distinguished restaurants. 
At such a luncheon gathering, recol­ lections of days in service are soon flying. 
The general tells of a visit during the 
Tunisian campaign to the head­ q u a r te rs of Gen. G eorge P atto n in 
Gafsa. 
Simpson recalls that the A m erican c o m m a n d e r had h e a p in g p la te s of peanut butter on his m ess table. He tells how' General Patton proceeded in his inimitable fashion to describe the 

 vigor of a famous and elderly Moroc­ can chieftain and attribute it to the fact that the “ (expletive) eats peanut but­ ter at every m eal.” 
DePhillips tells of a nervous night of pulling guard in front of a general’s quarters at Et. Jay and this leads to an hilarious tale about the rookie sentry who failed to recognize the gigantic cav alry m u s ta c h e and ra n k of the celebrated Col. Tommy Tompkins. 
Later in his room, Simpson settles down for an interview'. 

Gen. Omar Bradley has recent­ ly written for an almanac an appraisal of the ll) greatest military leaders in history. 

Sim pson has seen the list, which included only two 
World 
War 
II leaders, German Field Marshal Erwin 
Rommel and 
Britain’s 
Sir 
Harold 
Alexander. 

“ I agree,” says Simpson. “ Alexander was m uch b etter than M ontgom ery 
(British Field Marshal B. L. Montgo­ mery), and you’ll notice he didn’t list 
Eisenhower or Patton..When you know a guy personally, it m akes a differ­ ence.” 

Simpson goes on to say that he re­ cently read a book on F rederick the 
Great, one of the choices, and agrees with Bradley about him and most of tin* others. 

He finds less e n th u sia sm for the choice of Civil War General William T. 
Sherman because of the devastation he caused in his march through Georgia. 

The Civil War is close to G eneral 
Simpson. His uncle, John Sim pson, was on the staff of Gen. Nathan Bed­ ford Forrest, and after the war ended. was h a ra s s e d by carpetbaggers until he left Tennessee for Texas. 

Simpson was born on May 19, 
1888, in Weatherford and grew up 

 there and on his g ran d fath er’s farm not fur away. 

He heard tile stories of the Civ il Wal­ and its afterm ath from his uncle and from his father, who was a Confederate p rivate d u rin g the last y e a r of the conflict. 

“ I rode four miles from my g ran d ­ father’s place to school,” he recalls, 
“ and I took my lunch in a bucket that I carried on m y arm . I would tie my horse to a tree by a stream near the schoolhouse.” 

His interest in a military career was aroused as early as the tim e lie was 
"six or seven.” 

“ We were always playing cowboys and Indians with wooden g u n s,” he recounts. “ My grandfather told me, I see you playing soldier all the time. 
Why don’t you go lo West Point?” ’ 

That’s just what young Simpson did a few years later. Ile was a junior in high school in Weatherford when he* learned that tile congressman for the district had a vacancy to fill at West 
Point. 

Without knowledge of his parents he wrote (he congressman and was informed that the choice would be m ade from P ark er County where he lived, and that he had only one rival. 

A com mittee headed by a judge was appointed to interview the two Weath­ erford prospects. At the* end of a long session, young Bill Simpson was on his way to West Point at 18. 

His m other was so elated that she gave her son $1 to take the judge to lunch. "You could get a big lunch for 
58 cents and you didn’t have to tip," 
Simpson relates. 

The future general, however, still had to pass tin* tough entrance exam which covered a number of subjects he had not studied during his brief high school career. 

Off he went to a West Point prepar­ atory school at Highland Falls, N Y., near the military academy. 

Young S im p so n tra v e lle d to the c ra m school th ro u g h th e snow by sleigh. 

 the Fourth Army his office w as d ir ­ ectly above the room iii which lie had taken the exam some 111 years earlier 

In a real sense, 
( I m * g e n e r a l agrees, his military career began and ended iii virtually the sam e spot ut Ft. 
Sam Houston. 
Arid it was a very distinguished ca r­ eer. 
G eneral Simpson m ay well be the most modest of A m erica's galaxy of 
World War ll stars. 
T here’s never a hint of a boast in his recollections of his m ilitary service. 
But the men who served with him ha­ ven’t forgotten him. 
T he Ninth Arm y s e e m s to follow him, it followed him on the night of tlx- city election when he dropped by Hie victory party at the Monger, of Mayor 
Lila Cockrell. 
Upon meeting the m ayor’s husband, 
Sid Cockrell, the general was delighted 

His military career be­ gan and ended at al­ most the same spot on 
Tart Sa tit 11 on sh ta 

 to learn that he had served in the Ninth as a captain in an artillery unit. 
“ I run into Ninth Army men all the time at the hotel,” reports Simpson. 

The general’s room at the hotel is typically unpretentious. There is a table covered with recen t books on 
World War II. 
A dresser contains family pictures, including a cherished portrait of his wife, who d ied in 1971 d u r in g the fiftieth year of their m arriage. 
On the wall hang three fram ed do­ cuments. 
At the right is a letter from General 
Eisenhower congratulating Simpson on operations of the Ninth Army. Next to it is a length^ message from Field 
M arshal M ontgom ery p ra is in g the 
Ninth Army for its Operation Grenade in the Hoer offensive in February and 
March, 1945. 
To the left is a special citation from 
Uh* C h ild ren ’s Hospital Foundation,* noting that he had served as general campaign chairm an for the financing of the Children’s Hospital in 1955 and had continued to serve as tre a su rer and board m em ber until 1974. 
“ T hat is the civilian contribution that I ain m ost proud of,” says the general softly. 
Ix»t it be noted that one of Am erica’s great generals is as proud of his work for c h ild re n as of his m il ita r y triumphs. 

“The old man who taught us had all of the exam s which had been given since West Point was founded,” Sim p­ son laughs. “ I rented a room with another fellow in a boarding house and all we did was study like hell.” 

When the lim e cam e for the e x a ­ mination, Simpson returned to Texas, came to San Antonio arid stayed at a long-vanished hotel on Broadway. 

“ On the day in May that I was lo take the exam, I took a streetcar to the Ft. 
Sam Houston Q uadrangle,’’ recounts the general. 

“ I turned to the first door on the right to the room where I took the ex­ am .” 

He passed, of course. 

That was in 19o5

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sunday Ma/ I I 977 
Fishbait tells all 

Continued from P age III would unfold, Bob Leggett conies to 
Washington in the midterm election of the Kennedy administration. He is young, handsome. He has a lovely, un­ derstanding wife, Barbara, who doesn't make waves when he decides to give up a lucrative law practice. He gets a seat on the House Armed Ser­ vices Committee and is starting his rise to power. But almost immediately, it happens. He meets a beautiful, so­ phisticated Capitol Hill secretary and starts dating her. 
She becomes pregnant and wants him to marry her. He is Catholic and can’t get a divorce. The sophisticated young girl is not that sophisticated. 
She is Catholic, too, and doesn’t want an abortion. 
The compromise, in true soap-opera style, is that he buys her a house and sets her up as a back-street wife. More plot comes with the second pregnancy. 
Meanwhile, knowing nothing of the reason her husband is overworked and overtired, Congressman Bob’s wife continues to raise their three children. 
After more than 111 years this situa­ tion, there is a traumatic moment. 
Barbara finds out about her husband’s other family. She also finds out that her husband has forged her signature he needed when buying the house for his mistress. 
Now it all comes out. Shocking as it is, it hasn’t been easy for the poor congressman, either. How he has suf­ 

 fered making ends meet with two fa­ milies on a salary of $42,5(1o. which was mercifully raised to $44,6oo eventually. 
He has had to cash in a small retire­ ment plan and give speeches on the lecture circuit to try to meet that 
$2o,ooo-a-year cost of a second family. 
As if that weren’t complicated enough, in soap-opera fashion it turns out that a new girl has entered the picture several years ago, Su/y Park 
Thomson, the exotic Korean-born as­ sistant to Leggett’s top-leadership boss. Speaker of the House Carl Albert. 
Leggett’s position as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, with access to classified military in­ formation, makes the situation even more sensitive. His colleagues are disappointed when he changes his po­ sition and starts supporting the go­ vernment of South Korean President 

Park Chung Hee. 
As I’ve said, it would make one hell of a good soap opera, but how would it all end? 
In July, 1976, as the story was un­ folding in the press, Bob Leggett con­ tinued to write his own best lines. 
While not denying his complicated love life, he did deny that he had benefitted financially from his position on Korea. 
“ I will admit that I have egg on my face, but not gravy,” he said. 
The ones who know what is going on up on the Hill are the night staffers, the parking garage people, the guards, the elevator operators. They see which congressman has doubled back to the offices with a pretty girl about mid­ night. This usually means the girl has a roommate and the congressman is too cheap, or afraid, to get a motel room. 
C heaper’ play slated 

The musical comedy “ Cheapter by the Dozen” will be presented at 7:3o p.m. 
Friday in Memorial High School Auditorium by members of the school’s choir and band. 
Proceeds from ticket sales will go toward the purchase of a sound system for the auditorium. 
Approximately 5o students are participating in the musical, which was written by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey about their family adventures. 
Choreography for the musical is by Memorial High School Vice Principal Ray 
Connor. 
Tickets are $1 for adults and 51) cents for children under 5 and may be purehased at the door. 
______________________________ 

Sometimes, on the campaign trail, male reporters have actually gotten jealous because of dalliance between some pretty female reporter and the candidate. LB J was only one of many known to give a female reporter an inside track. 
The trouble with Hill marriages is that congressmen, after the election brings them to Washington, can’t re­ member how and don’t have time to be good husbands — they don't have time to be good lovers to their outside cuties, either. 
Wayne Hays, for example, used to brag that he had a gal he liked to lean over the desk al noontime and “ have for lunch” every day. I have no idea who he meant. 
Some of the men really do love their wives. They just need to feel young. 
One told me, "You’re as young as last night’s piece of (expletive deleted).” 
I remember what Barbara Howar said about romance in Washington: 
"Sex in Washington is Henry Kissinger slowing down to 35 miles per hour to drop you off from a date.” 
Believe it.

Frank Abagnale tells distributive education students about his exploits in the netherworld 
Con man tells his wild story 

By GARY MACLIN 
A Houston man who conned his way around the world says crime doesn’t pay. 
Frank W. Abagnale, probably the world’vS greatest imposter, spoke to 
North East School District distributive education students about his esca­ pades. 
His discussion also detailed ways in which retailers and cashiers can detect someone who’s passing a bad check. 
Abagnale told of his life of fraud, forgery, thefts and impersonation from the time he was a 16-year-old high school dropout until he was finally snared by the FBI. 
Abagnale, who turned 29 Wednesday, passed $2.5 million in worthless checks in 26 countries while posing as an air­ line pilot, an assistant attorney gener­ al, a pediatrician, a lawyer and a col­ lege professor. 
His I.Q. is 136. 
The one-time con man is now head of 
P’rank W. Abagnale & Associates of 
Houston, the firm he formed to help companies combat check forgeries. 
“The only way I could make it was to make my life an open book,” 
Abagnale said. 
He said his parole officer told him he should work in a business where he could teach others how to detect for­ geries and other fraud. 
He began work as an investigator for an insurance company and later be­ came a consultant to one of the state’s largest internal theft agencies. 
Abagnale is now producing a series of educational films on "white collar” crime for use by banking and retailing industries. 
The white collar crime specialist is on the lecture circuit for hotels, banks, insurance companies and department stores. 
He also volunteers his time to public schools and law enforcement classes. 
Abagnale began his bizarre life of crime when, at 16, he ran away from home because of family problems. 
He first went to New York City where, without job or money, he "be­ gan writing checks and impersonating people. 
“ I got better as the years went by,” he said. 
But hot checks weren’t his only spe­ cialty. 
His ambition to be an airline pilot soon came true. 
He got a pilot’s uniform from a uni­ form company by posing as a pilot from a major United States airline. 
That particular airline was known to use that uniform manufacturer. 
The bachelor got his identification card through a commercial LD. card company, and then went to a hobby shop where he bought some airline model planes. 
The clear decals inside the models made a logo after he placed them on his photo I.D. card. 
Next came the pilot's license. That was easy enough for the con man. 
In an aviation magazine he found an ad for pilots who could have their licenses engraved in silver on an 8 by 
IO plaque. 

All they had to do was send the engraver the pertinent information from his Federal Aviation Adminis­ tration license. 
The engraver accepted the informa­ tion given him by Abagnale and produced a convincing replica of a pi­ lot’s license. 
“ I had it photocopied, reduced to wallet size and then printed on a white card to match the administration’s license,” he said. 
From that day on through the next six years, the con man never paid for another flight ticket. 
At times Abagnale rode in the copi­ lot’s seat of 7o7 and 747 jet airliners. 
On one of his stops to Baton Rouge, he “ thought I ’d try my hand at prac­ ticing law.” 
He studied and on his third try passed the state bar exam. Abagnale presented bogus bachelor’s and law degrees from Harvard to the office of the attorney general and soon went to work for him. 
The 1oth grade dropout worked six months representing the state in suits filed by small businessmen. 
He soon came up against an opposing lawyer who graduated from Harvard. 
‘‘He started talking to me and checked up and found out I didn’t go to 
Harvard. I took off,” said Abagnale. 
From Baton Rouge he went to At­ lanta where he claimed he was a phy- 

<7 re g re t w h at 
I've done. A ll the m oney in the w orld can't replace the y e a rs I've lit st in p riso n ’ 

 sician on extended vacation. 
All went well until a staff doctor at a hospital in an Atlanta suburb moved into his complex. 
“ I had to start studying medicine to keep up a conversation with him,” said Abagnale. 
He eventually joined the hospital as a pediatrics consultant and later became resident supervisor of the night shill. 
More schemes followed, in­ cluding a stint as a professor of socio­ logy w ho got his master’s degree from 
Columbia University. 
Abagnale, armed with his M.A., taught a semester of summer school at a large private university in Utah. 
The Abagnale saga went on until finally he was arrested by Interpol agents in southern France. He served six months in a shoddy French prison and then another six months in Swe­ den. 
Abagnale was extradited to the 
United States but escaped by removing the airplane restroom’s toilet fixture and sliding through the opening when his plane landed. 
Three months later he was caught and imprisoned. 
Abagnale escaped this time by con­ vincing an officer he was a federal jail inspector on undercover assignment in jail. 
The officer unwittingly released him. 
With F B I agents closing in on an 
Atlanta motel in which he was staying. 
Abagnale left his room through a rear door. 
Two agents approached him. He said 
“ Davis, FBI. Is Shea here yet?” re­ ferring to special agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office John A. Shea. 
The agents said he-wasn’t and 
Abagnale told them to go wait around front while he covered the back. Shea arrived a few minutes later. 
Abagnale was gone. 

He was finally nabbed and served nearly four years in a federal prison. 
After his release in February 1974, he got jobs with a restaurant and su­ permarket and worked his way up to management positions. 
However, he was fired both times when his criminal record was dis­ closed. 
That’s when he decided to make his life an open book. 
“ I regret what I've done. All the money in the world can't replace the years I ’ve lost in prison. 
"I don’t know of any crime or any amount of money worth going to prison for,” Abagnale said.

.jobs in the service areas all through the 7os. even while we were losing jobs in m an ufacturing and retail trade.” 
Typically, these people come here to go to college and never leave. 
They are people like 
Dorothy' 
Curran, 24, who grew up in Buffalo, 
N.V., and came to the Boston area to go to college. 
When she was graduated two years ago from Wellesley, she realized, “ I couldn't go back to Buffalo very easily and find a good job. And there are lots of things here that you just can’t find in the Midwest.” 
So now she lives in Boston and com­ mutes to a suburban computer firm, where she works as a technical writer. 
For generations, this has been a city of immigrants, Irish and Italian mostly, whose standard of success was 
• getting enough money to move to the suburbs. 
But these new' Bostonians have other ideas. “Our surveys show that many of them grew' up in the suburbs and now prefer city life,” Ganz says. “ They like the cultural and recreational facilities and the access to young people their own age.” 
Their impact is most evident on the neighborhood known as “ the w ater­ front.” Ten years ago, it was 1o4 acres of dilapidated fruit warehouses, wharves and tin-sided shacks. Now it is Boston’s most trendy, glistening neighborhood. 
About 4o of the substantial granite wharves and warehouses have been cleaned up and trimmed out. Now they are filled with posh shops, restaurants, offices and some of the most expensive apartments in the city. 
Since 197o, the waterfront population has gone from less than 1,ooo to 3,4oo people. And it is the new professionals who are paving $125,ooo for a two-bedroom condominium on a wharf. 
The place swarms with young doctors, lawyers, architects and engineers. 

Probably the single most important factor in attracting them to Boston is the colleges. There are more than 8o of them in the metropolitan area. They range from the heights of Harvard to the anonymity of junior business col­ leges. 
“There are a lot of graduates who are attracted to living rn Boston,” says 
Edward Rowley, director of alumni placem ent at H arvard B usiness 
School. “ I t ’s a significant percen ­ tage.” 
They come from everywhere to 
Boston, a good number grew up in New 
York and New Jersey, and this is what they compare it. with. 

“ Obviously, New York has a lot of things Boston doesn’t,” says Rowley. 
“ New York is a bigger stage for tigers to operate on. 
“ But a lot of people feel the price of 
New York is too high, both eco n­ omically and in how much tim e it takes. Boston has a better balance of convenience and nice things than New 
York does. This is a good place to live.” 
The human scale of Boston — its 
“ livability,” as Mayor Kevin H. White puts it — is usuay mentioned when people talk about why they came here. 
“ New York seemed just too big,” said Frail Jacobs, 26, a native of PT. 
Lee, N.J. “There are too many people. 
I always had a feeling there that I never knew an area very well and couldn't know enough people.” 
Then she came to Brandeis Uni­ versity, which is just outside Boston in 
Waltham. “ I’ve been here IO years, and I’m constantly running into people 
I know. Boston seems much smaller and more manageable.” 
So here she stays, working as an educational consultant and zipping to 
New Hampshire for quiet weekends in the country. 
C om pared with most A m erican cities, Boston is compact. The city covers 48 square miles, while San An­ tonio, which has about the sam e number of people, sprawls over 154 square miles. 

It is a 1o-minute subway ride, for instance, from the downtown Boston department stores to the snazzy bou­ tiques, 2o bookstores and college-aged throngs of Harvard Square. 
Fenway F’ark, home of the Boston 
Red Sox, is a short walk from Sym­ phony Hall, home of the Boston Sym­ phony. FTee rock concerts on the banks of the Charles can be com fortably heard from the lush a p a rtm e n ts carved out of grand Beacon Hill draw­ ing rooms. 
“ I have easy access to everything.” says Miss C urran, the W ellesley graduate. “ It’s very easy to get out of 
Boston to go skiing or sailing. And I can just walk across the park to go to the Museum of Fine Arts. 
“ I go to everything, literally. Sym­ phony, concerts, museums, the opera, international films.” 
Packed into this small piece of geo­ graphy is a bubbling array of enter­ tainment. On a typical weekend, there are apt to be performances of 5o dif­ ferent plays and concerts. Forty art galleries have exhibits; 3o theaters show- movies, 
“ T h ere’s an awful lot of talen t hanging a ro u n d ,” says 
Alonzo 
Saunders, 3o, of Cincinnati, a lawyer who discovered Boston when he went to 
Harvard. 
“ It’s not Broadway, Lord knows,” he says, “ but you can see and do a com­ parable range of things here.”

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BOSTON — First came the 
British. Then the Irish, Italians and blacks. Now a new migra­ tion is swarming into Boston, changing the city in a way as dramatic as its waves of prede­ cessors. 
These new settlers take over down­ town neighborhoods abandoned by people who had money enough to leave. 
And they are saving Boston from boarded up theaters, tumbledown a r ­ chitecture and after-dark desertion thai are the imprint of old American cities. 
They are the young professionals. 
Thousands of them between the ages of 2o and 35 are moving from towns across the United States to work and live in Boston. Together they form a social class with ample money and broad energy. And they have begun to shape the face of the old city like a new breed of Boston Brahmin. 
They have moved into shabby neighborhoods and turned sleazy ten­ ements and rickety warehouses into chic, expensive places to live. 
On warm, spring evenings, these new Boston Brahmins squirm between the heaped up pushcarts in Haymarket 
Square and dicker over a week’s sup­ ply of cut-rate vegetables. 
They sip gin and tonics on the roof- decks of Beacon Hill townhouses and watch sailboats glide down the 
Charles. 
. They savor veal at North End nofe-in-the-walfs, Beethoven at Sym­ phony Hall and outrageous theater in church basements. 
AH over the city, there are signs of the working young. They embrace the city like newly converted zealots. 
“They are an important factor in the revival of the city as a place to live,” says Alexander Ganz. research direc­ tor of the Boston R edevelopm ent 
Authority. 
They have made downtown Boston the fastest growing residential district in the metropolitan area, and they have stopped the decades of flight to the suburbs. 
In I96o, 45.62o people lived down­ town. Now’ there are 1o,ooo more, and by 
1985, the urban renewal agency expects there to be 72,5oo. 
Since 197o, the steady decline in the citywide population has stopped, and the city has begun to grow again. 
"Our city census shows that the in­ flux is concentrated in the 25 to 34 age group,” says Ganz. “ These are middle class young adults, largely profession­ als.” 
Since 1971, they have been moving into the city at a rate of about 5,ooo a year. 
“ They are finding jobs in higher education, medicine, finance, insur­ ance, engineering, law and business,”

Carter assures a hot summer 

President Carter has assured himself a hot summer. 
But that is the price of lea­ dership and if Americans are smart, they will follow the lea­ dership with constructive de­ bate, m eaning they will stick with the debate until credible data are produced. 
Our desk has acquired a new stack of inform ation on the 
Carter energy proposals. Con­ tradictions abound. Positions are defended. Reason may yet be possible. 

A new stack will shortly de­ velop containing information on health care costs. The President assured a lively debate with his proposal to limit the rate of in­ crease in hospital charges to nine per cent a year. HEW studies suggestion he will also delve into physician charges raised the level of heat on that issue. 

The oil-state viewpoint (that the President slighted attention to producing more oil and gas) is being overshadowed national­ ly by the conservation argu­ ment, but the plain fact is that conservation is the only quick- ly-available way to stretch oil and gas supplies. We would as­ sume that by raising the price for new gas by 33 cents per thousand cubic feet 
(the proposed rate) would help some, but intrastate buyers of gas 
(Texas, for example) would still 

 likely pay more. Control of in­ trastate commerce has been — and we think remains — outside of congressional reach. 
In the health-care field, the presidential proposals and sug­ gestions in HEW studies afford excellent opportunities for health care authorities to ex­ plain their business. 
Com plexity of insurance claim forms, if that is a valid complaint, is frequently heard. 
Confusion in billing, high cost of staying up-to-date with rapid­ ly-advancing technology, high construction costs, relatively- high labor requirements to staff hospitals, and the problems with m alpractice insurance pre­ miums are among the topics to explain. 

Hospitals and doctors have a story to tell about the health costs of Am ericans’ living ha­ bits. A car wreck victim can trigger emergency medical ser­ vices that may run to more than 
$2o,ooo a day. Drug abuse — al­ cohol and valium are the leading offenders by a wide margin — resulting from abuse wind up in the figures on medical bills and insurance permiums. 

As the debate heats up, we will be interested in trying to winnow the sturdy facts. Only possibility for sound policy and corrective action lies in that search. 
North Sea oil helps 
England into future 

Americans are fond of trac­ ing British history and finding, or think they are finding, clues to which way America will go. A provocative question for politi­ cians, economists and others is to ponder the old slogan: There will always be an England. 
Will there be? 
Conversations lately with Ri­ chard Fyjis-W alker, an infor­ mation specialist for the British governm ent, and an essay by 
Lord Watkinson, who is presi­ dent of the Confederation of 
British Industry ( ’’Journal of 
Commerce,” April ti), suggest there is resiliency in the islands yet. 

The trade unions have taken their medicine, after a fashion, and government policy under­ stands the essential need for in­ dustrial profitability. Wage in­ flation has been reduced and pay restraint policies have been agreed to, but profitability re­ mains too low. 
But there is high hope for 
Britain to be in fine shape soon, thanks to North Sea oil. Oil in­ dependence is forecast within three years. Oil m oney will further improve the trade ba­ lance. A healthy surplus is fore­ cast next year. 
Britain’s so-called invisible 

 trade — banking, insurance, shipping and tourism — ac­ counts for ll per cent of the world’s market, second only to the U. S. 
Coal reserves are good for 3oo years, and Britain early learned the value of clean-burning of coal. London was literally re­ prieved from the smog blight by determined clean air standards 
— that worked. 
British trade unions still have a hammerlock on business and warnings against letting 
Americans go that far are quite valid. But comparisons between the U. S. and the small British 
Isles don’t fit in many areas of enterprise. Social customs and programs have run similar pat­ terns, but loss of empire and the lack of space in the islands helped to drive government into socialism. 
Americans can profit from 
British experience with social programs, to be sure, and can usefully study the erosion of profit and its inevitable results. 
And we can take to heart 
Lord Watkinson’s observation of the future: “We have a hard slog ahead of us on the road to reco­ very — but at least we know where we are going and there is a national determination to suc­ ceed.”

Health industry doesn’t need Carter’s controls 

President Carter, having done what he could to oil companies and car manufacturers with his energy plan, has now taken aim at the chronic problem of rising health costs. 
As may be expected, the medical community is reacting as if it has been hit in the head with a bat. 
It has. 
In brief. Carter’s two-prong attack on the health industry is directed at two high-cost areas: hospitals and doctors. 
The first salvo was aimed at hospi­ tals. Carter wants to limit increases in hospital charges to nine per cent per year. 
By an involved, and you can be sure, complex formula, hospital charges would have to fall in line with an econom ist’s n ig h tm a re invention called the gross national product in­ flator and also with increases in ho­ spital charges over recent years. 
While hospital administrators were reeling with that blow. Carter fired the next shot at an area in medicine bor­ dering on the sacred — doctors’ fees. 
Frankly, no one, including the White 
House or the paragons of efficiency at the U.S. Department of Health, Edu­ cation and Welfare, can say exactly what kind of curb is planned for the ceiling on doctor’s fees. 

It seems, however, to hinge on some kind of uniform schedule of pay­ ments to doctors through government health programs based on current fee levels. 
The aim is for all doctors — at a yet-determined state, regional or na­ tional level — to be paid, irrespective of specialty, the sam e rate for the same service. 
The New York Times, in all apparent seriousness, said the latest Carter jolt would create an enormous controversy between organized medicine and the federal government, sim ilar to that which occured during the battle for 

Medicare in 1965. 
To judge from the medical estab­ lishment’s reaction, it will be more like the final battle of Armageddon. 
The one undeniable facet of Carter’s argument is that medical costs — spe­ cifically hospital and doctors’ fees — have risen w ith head-spinning speed. 
That is -not news. Anyone who has gone to the doctor, been hospitalized or tried to keep up with pay check de­ ductions for medical insurance can attest that something is haywire in the cost departments. 

But Carter’s advisers left out what some folks in the health industry believe is an important side of the cost equation. 
Hospital costs have also increased w ith startling rapidity — in most cases astronomically more than the nine per cent figure. 
Doctors, too, have felt the squeeze play of inflation and recession we more mortal consumers have felt. 
The effect of a standard rate for doctor fees would create havoc in the profession, something that the bizarre fee schedule of Medicare/Medicaid has been doing all along on a somewhat lesser scale. 
But federally-fixed charges, in all honesty, would be more dam aging philosophically to the doctors. They would be denied the ability as profes­ sionals to charge for their services in the marketplace. 
Hospitals, however, fate something a little more basic than a philosophic fall from grace. Federal limits to ho-

Schools suffer as finance reform lags 

It has been five years now since a three-judge federal court here agreed with Edgewood ESD parent Demetrio Rodriguez that school financing in Texas was rigged against poor districts. 
It has been four years since the U. S. 
Supreme Court took Texas off the hook by one vote — ruling that the school finance system was not unconstitu­ tional. 
But the Supreme Court decision also held that the “ need is apparent for reform in tax systems which may well have relied too long and too heavily on the local property tax.’’ 
The court, in effect, called upon state government to make those reforms. 
A jubilant Gov. Dolph Briscoe an­ nounced that Texas would “ gladly ac­ cept’’ the challenge. 
A couple of weeks ago the new model of state school financing rum bled through the Texas House, aided by an emergency communique from Briscoe.

 measure. State Rep. Bob Vale, Bexar’s top authority on financing measures, explains: 
“ I voted against the plan for several reasons. It was written to favor rural areas over urban areas and rich dis­ tricts over poor districts. 

And how is Texas progressing toward meeting the “challenge’’ set by the courts in the Rodriguez case? 
“ We moved forward one step two years ago,” responds Vale, “ and now they’ve moved backward four steps.” 
Vale’s complaints are pretty squar­ 

 ely on the mark. Actions of the present legislature, prodded by the governor and its rural leadership, have been profoundly anti-city — which means also, anti-poor schools.. 
The scandal which originally moved the three-judge court to find the school finance system discriminatory was the gap in funds available to Edgewood as compared to wealthier districts. 
What has been done to correct this? 
Edgewood has gained on a percentage basis when compared with the Alamo 
Heights District. But on a basis of dol­ lars actually available for spending per pupil, the gap between the two districts has widened considerably. 

The measure rammed through the House is primarily a plan to insure school tax reductions at the local level. 
What will happen? The average cut in Edgewood will be $8 per year. In some wealthy districts the cuts will average around $6o. 
A com puter impact model shows that next year Edgewood could muster 
$958 per pupil —• a gain of $167. 

The super-wealthy Deer Park dis­ trict in the Houston area, however, would have $1,953 per pupil, up $126. 

The rural bias, meanwhile, is shown by the case of the Hereford District in the bailiwick of House Speaker Bill 
Clayton. It boasts eight tim es the wealth per student of Edgewood, but w ill pick up $171 in additional state aid 
— or $4 more than Edgewood. 
It seems a bit outrageous, too, that 
South San Antonio District taxpayers, shown by the Research and Planning 
Council to be paying the highest effec­ tive tax rate of local schools at $1.14 per SKH) of market value, will get vir­ tually no relief. 

D espite much w ailing, the 
Alamo Heights District currently has the lowest effective tax rate at 7o cents. 
And values in the district are soaring still higher. 
The down-at-the-heels San Antonio 
District comes off poorly in the House plan gaining a mere $1o7 per pupil in additional state aid — less than the 

 average for rural or suburban dis­ tricts, though its problems are great. 
A bigger defeat for the SAISD and other hard-pressed urban districts was the manuevering by the leadership to sidetrack a proposal by Vale which would assist them in financing de­ sperately-needed construction. 
Though 33 states help finance con­ struction of facilities Texas so far has refused to do so. This places SAISD, which has less than one-half the slate average of property value per pupil and which has a very elderly school plant, at a great disadvantage. 
Vale predicts the blows to the hopes of San Antonio area taxpayers will continue. He argues that so much of available money has been earmarked for highways — another rural priority 
— that little will be left for oilier needs. 
Improvements in school teacher pay will largely be dumped in the laps of the school districts. 
And Vale argues that San Antonians hoping for relief from the utility tax and for state aid to teaching hospitals might as well forget it this time. 

 spital charges would essentially put hospitals out of business or weaken their effectiveness. 

Hospitals have been locked in the squeeze of costs rising at an alarming spiral since the beginning of this decade’s economic confusion. 
This is not the first time Uncle Sam has played with hospital accounting ledgers. Hospitals were among the last to be freed from the price controls in­ voked by President Nixon in the early 
‘7os. 
The rampage of rising costs during a period of set charges left administra­ tors stumbling through the fiscal rub­ ble that ensued. 
They are still trying to figure out what happened. Locally, hospitals were hit hard — as was everyone — by the incredible increases in utility costs. 

Hospitals still feel the pinch of esca­ lating food prices, increased wage de­ mands and an almost monthly increase in costs of every supply item imagina­ ble — from X-ray machines to bed sheets. 

Hospitals, ironically, are like you and me. The cost of their very exis­ tence goes up daily. With Carter’s plan to limit annual increases in patient charges to 9 per cent, the income just won’t m^et the outgo, according to most administrators. 

When that happens, hospitals — like us — go broke. 
Hospital administrators and doctors have been muttering about the unfair­ ness of Carter singling out one seg­ ment of the economy for such drastic controls. 
They are right. It is unfair. The same federal logic could be applied to lawyers, schools and manufacturers of 
Frisbees. 
But more than being unfair. Carter’s plan is dangerous. We can get along without Frisbees much better than we can without hospitals of' doctors. 

CIA plays rough 

WASHINGTON - The games that the Central In telligen ce 
Agency plays have produced a terrible toll in human suffering. 

The consequences have been catas­ trophic for forlorn peoples from the 
Khambas in the high Himalayas to the the Mideast hinterlands. 
The painful details are buried deep in the CIA’s vaults, but enough can now be pieced together to tell the suppre­ ssed story. It is a story of how the 
CIA has conscious­ ly exploited unso­ phisticated and prim itive peoples for political, econ­ omic and military purposes. Invaria­ bly, the hinter- landers who were used by the CIA suffered severely for trusting in the United States. 
This sad, sordid chapter in Ameri­ can history should be exposed while 
Washington is still debating the CIA’s future. For three decades, the CIA has considered it necessary to get down and operate at the Communist level, w ithout regard for fair play and human rights. There is no place for American traditions, contend the CIA sophisti­ cates, in the dirty game of world in­ trigue. 
The purpose of the CIA's secret in­ trigues, presumably, has been to bol­ ster U.S. power and influence around the world. Yet the results, unhappily, have been distressingly the opposite. 
In the early 196os, for example, the 
CIA re c ru ite d Tibetan trib esm en , known as Khaas, who had fled the Red 
Chinese on wiry ponies into the high fastnesses of Nepal. The Khambas were brought lo the United States for training: then they were outfitted with 
American saddles, small arm s and other provisions suitable for mountain warfare. 

At the instigation of the CIA, the galloping Khambas would swoop down on Chinese military encampments in 
Tibet. The tribesmen were led by the 
CIA to believe they would reconquer their lost homeland with American help. They continued their h a ra ss­ ments against the Chinese sporadical­ ly for a decade until the CIA lost in­ terest. Then the proud K ham bas, without CIA supplies to sustain them, straggled down from the mountains into the valleys of Nepal. They subsist today as pitiful and unw anted r e ­ fugees. 
Perhaps no primitive people have been so cruelly manipulated, however, as the Kurds who lived in the moun­ tainous region of the Middle E ast where Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria and the Soviet Union come together. The unfortunate Kurds became pawns on 
Henry Kissinger’s chessboard in May, 
1972. 
Kissinger looked upon Iran as the geopolitical base for U.S. operations in the area and developed a close rela­ tionship with the Shah. The Shah, in turn, was involved in border and navi­ gation disputes with Iraq. He also felt threatened by Iraq’s close relationship with the Soviet Union. He, therefore, sought to stir up the simmering strug­ gle between the Kurds and the Iraqis. 
In May, 1972, Kissinger brought his mentor, then-President Richard Nix­ on, to Tehran for a meeting with the 
Shah. At the Shah’s insistent request, the two American leaders agreed to arm the Kurds for warfare against the 
Iraqis. The CIA, to its credit, resisted this particular scheme. But Nixon and 
Kissinger had made their decision. 

During the months that fol­ lowed, the CIA smuggled $16 million worth of untraceable Chinese and So­ viet arms through Iran to the Kurds. 
They fought the Iraqis to a standstill. 
The jubilant Kissinger dispatched a telegram through CIA channels to the 
Kurdish leader, Gen. Mustafa Barzani, on Feb. 22, 1975. 
“ My dear G eneral,” K issinger's message began. “ I want you to know of our admiration for you and your people and for the valiant effort you are making . . . I am convinced that se­ crecy has been of paramount impor­ tance in maintaining our ability to do what we have done; it is only for this reason — plus our concern for your personal safety — that I hesitate to suggest a personal'meeting here with you.” 

No more than two weeks later, the 
Shah suddenly announced he had come to terms with Iraq. One of the terms, apparently, was the termination of 
A m erican-Iranian support for the 
Kurds. Overnight, this support dried up; without the military wherewithal, the Kurds were overpowered. Thou­ sands poured into Iran, helpless re­ fuges, without bullets for the guns the 
CIA had given them. Gen. Barzani pleaded with Nixon and Kissinger for humanitarian help. His appeals were ignored. 

Eventually, a token 4oo Kurdish refugees were admitted to the United 
States, and another 3oo visas have now been granted. But last January, the 
State Dept, also granted visas to an official Iraqi delegation to call upon the Kurds in America ostensibly to persuade them to come home. 
The delegation, accom panied by armed State Dept, bodyguards, visited 
Kurds in California, Florida and North 
Dakota. There was no outright intimi­ dation or harassment of the Kurds, so far as we can learn. But the Iraqi visit alarmed them, and now that they are known to the Iraqis, the Kurdish re­ fugees fear for the fate of their rela­ tives in Iraq.

Sir: Several comments about the television broadcasts of the Battle of Flowers and Fiesta Flambeau parades appear to be in order 

All of the broadcasters, I believe, referred to the new cobblestones on 
Alamo Plaza. I think that the stones which were used to pave the plaza, eliminating most of the more at­ tractive green space, are referred to as flagstones because of their Ila! surface. Parenthetically, I think the complete result is something less than an Improvement. I doubt that there are any streets paved with ro b bl es ton es re m a in in g in the 
United States. 

Scripts should be available to the broadcasters, and reviewed, prior lo the broadcasts so that a little better job of pronouncing the names of individuals and the names of places and their approximate loca­ tions could be done. 

Finally, particularly as to the photography, I thought there were too many close-up shots resulting in missing the broader views of well- trained m arching units arid the over-all views of some of the beau­ tiful floats.

D D T. or daylight deceiving time. I was sitting on the bench waiting for the bus at Carson Street and N. New

He passed in front of me, then whirled around and socked me In the jaw. He did not knock me out, but stunned me. I figured playing opossum was the better part of valor. He dragged me around on 
Carson where two more men were waiting for the first slugging m ug­ ger. 
Knowing that soldiers seldom missed going to work in the past at this time, I gave a loud yell, and believe it carried three or four blocks. But there must have been only amnesty seekers working in the fort that day — nobody came to illy aid. 
I am 74 but that is the only time in life I ever called for help, but muggers row is a good name for this side of the viaduct as well as across the tracks.

Recently an Express article esti­ mated there are eight million ille­ gal aliens in this country from

The c o n s u m p tio n of s c a rc e energy by aliens in an energy crisis produces the same effect as sabo­ tage during war time, i.e. the go­ vernment and citizens are deprived of a resource to p reserve their survival. 
What President in wartime would sit idly by and allow this number of a lie n s to sa b o ta g e

Kearney, charged with authoriz­ ing his squad of agents to open mail and tap phones of suspected acces­ sories of the fugitive Weather Un­ derground, responsible for num er­ ous bombings and acts of terror, had but one resolve — to identify and arrest them in an effort to protect America. 

He could have taken the easy and safe route, covering mere routine leads. But one cannot, in this m an­ ner, effectively investigate those enemies of this country who plot and act deep in the bowels of sinis­ ter secrecy. 

This sam e Department of Justice has now assured CIA defector Phi­ lip Agee that he will not be prose­ cuted for exposing the nam es of secret CIA agents to the Russian 
KGB! 

Have we forgotten that we estab­ lished intelligence agencies as in­ su ra n c e a g a in s t a n o th e r P e a rl 
Harbor? Now, pursuant to demands of articulate libertarian pressure groups, our federal, state and local intelligence units are being d is­ mantled and emasculated. 

The winners? The terrorists, re­ volutionaries and organized crime. 
The losers? The American people. 
Why? Because the prosecution of 
Kearney, and possibly others, for doing their perceived patriotic du­ ty. will deter every current and future intelligence agent from ex­ ercising that m easure of initiative and risk necessary for our protec­ tion. knowing that a present or future administration might other­ wise prosecute him. A defenseless society soon becomes no society. 
Pray to God and demand of the 
President, Congressmen and the 
U.S. Attorney G eneral that this senseless persecution of Kearney le a se before we suffer an o th er

Just ask these millionaires 

 a s s o c ia t e m s s 

Money, you will be happy to know, isn’t everything. In fact, if you listen to some of A m eri­ ca ’s lucky lottery millionaires, it isn't anything. 
Sure. you can quit your job. move to 
Florida, take a trip with the wife. pay off the old bills, buy new clothes, help out Mom and Dad and Sister Sue, give to charity, pay off the old mortgage, buy a new house, invest in stocks and bonds arui real estate, buy a car and pay for it in cash, hunt and fish when you want to, visit the old country, spoil the children, cem ent the m a rria g e , increase the alimony and buy m ore lottery tickets. 
"It ain’t what it s cracked up to be," says N ettie A bbink of Skokie. IIL, seven months alter she won $9o,11(1(1 a year for 2o years in the Illinois State 
Lottery. 
"People get jealous, your friends get jealous and Uncle Sam takes all the money," she says. "It sounds like a lot of money — ail people see is a big dol­ lar sign, ll ain't worth it." 
Her attitude, though a trifle extreme., m irrors the feelings of many of the lottery w inners in a nationw ide A s­ sociated Press survey. 
Their biggest surprise after the su r­ prise of winning was the tax bite. They found themselves hiring lawyers and accountants they never needed before. 
The telephone wouldn't stop ringing as friends and strangers badgered them for m onetary favors and got nasty when they refused. For many, it got so bad that they sw itched to u n listed numbers. 
“ It’s a rotten deal. There’s hardly anything left to the check when the go v ern m en t gets through with it," says Joseph T. Rowan of Lynn, Mass. 
Rowan, a retired shoe factory m ain­ tenance man. won his state's lottery in 
1973 in 2o installments of $5o,ooo each. 
Alter federal and state taxes, he got 
$36,2oo. Now, he says. Uncle Sam is taking an o th er $1o,ooo in a d v a n c e payment on next year's taxes. 
William E. Walker, 34, of Strasburg, 
111., was a truck driver until he won the lottery a year and a half ago. He took a leave of absence and has not returned to work. 
"I never knowed what a lawyer was really,” he says. "Now I ’m paying 
$3,ooo and $4,ooo a year to lawyers and 
CPAs. Uncle Sam takes 2o per cent off the top, and the government takes a lot more in ways I never knew .... 
"S o far, th is has been m o re headaches than happiness. I’m a guy who worked his whole life for every dime I ever had. Now this is a com ­ plete different deal, a rat race, but I think I’ll get it straightened out soon. 
People think you got a million bucks in the bank and are living off the interest. 
Everybody thinks I’m a banker or a loan com pany. They borrow money from me and they don’t think to pay it back. There are so many shysters a r­ ound I can’t believe it.” 
Perhaps worse is the notoriety. Peo­ ple focus on rich folk and winners. 
“ I used to sit around with the boys drinking coffee and telling them about having a different woman every night while I was on the road,” Walker says a little sadly. “ Now when I tell the sam e lies, the word is all over town in 
15 m inutes.” 
Bill Tronzo, 48. of Beaver Falls, Pa., could have w atched the d raw in g in which he won his $1 million because his Little League gam e was rained out. 
But his second-hand TV set was bro­ ken. 
Now he has four TV sets in the six- bedroom home he bought from the state's lieutenant governor for $37,ooo. 
It serves his wife and five children well. The furniture that the loan com ­ pany was threatening to repossess has been replaced. His wife drives a new ear, ariel they a re th in k in g of remodeling the kitchen. 
Tronzo made less than $5 an hour as a welder, took home som e $7,oo1) a year. He never wrote a cheek. "I never had any money in the bank to write a cheek on.” lie says. 
Now his income after taxes is some 
$39,ooo. And his bank wants to limit his cash expenses to $1,ooo a month, about twice what the family spent when he was working. 
“ My kids never really had a n y th ­ ing," Tronzo says. "B ut they never complained. They just thought that was the way people lived ... My bank has been trying to slow me down. They

 want me to start thinking about sav ing something for my kids and their kids.” 
Bul Tronzo will not cut buck on one avocation, lie s couched Little League and youth basketball teams for years, and this year he plans to sponsor a team and name it for the man w ho paid for his Little Leaguers' uniforms over the years. He’s also thought of laking a part-time job, "but when I look at all the people who are laid off, I d on’t think it would be fair for me to work when they are looking for a job.” 
Many of the lottery w in n ers quit their jobs im m e d ia te ly , then la te r think of finding new work. Not so

Mike B restcnsky, 2o. of B ra c k e n ­ ridge, Pa., quit his steel mill job when he won. but now "I ve been looking iii the new spapers for a job. lf I find something I like. I ll take it ... It just has to be something I like. Nothing too hard.” 
Eunice Schiller bought a new home in Baltimore County. Md., but she kept her s e c r e ta ria l job. " Y o u ’re still working,” she says. "W inning doesn't change your life that m uch." 
Paul 
Weddell.

Mich., owned a furnace and appliance installation business, bought a new business and expanded into plumbing. 
Winner or not, he works seven days a week and answers night calls for ser­ vice. 
Harold Parker of Plymouth. Mich., whose wife won the Michigan lottery two years ago, still works as a m etal­ lurgist at the General Motors plant in 
Willow' Rim. 
Steve Horn was a newspaper ad­ vertising salesm an when he won the 
New Jersey lottery. He has now moved to Florida and is a free-lance adver­ tising and public relations m an. His wife still works, too. 
Dominic Race, 51, of Johnstown, Pa., won his state’s lottery in 1973 and quit his steel mill crane operator's job im­ mediately. He has not worked since. 
"You can’t work." lie says. "If you do.

Chief Little Fox, a full-blooded 
C herokee born on a re se rv a tio n in 
North Carolina, rented a two-bedroom, 
137-year-old house near Burton, Ohio, before he won his state’s lottery. Now he owns a brick and stone seven-be­ droom home on five acres. He paid 
$6o,ooo for it and is told it’s worth more than $1oo,ooo now. 

On the county rolls as Om ar Watts, 
Chief Little Fox. 5o, still runs his lawn mower sales and repair business and still is a volunteer firem an, despite three heart attacks and a recent heart operation. 
Two of his seven children lived in foster hom es before he won. He brought them home.

 especially those who had already en­ dured the first blush of luck, said that not having lo worry continually about money, present and future, pervaded their lives 
Ed Henry, 46, ol Morristown, P a ,• says lie and his wile m ade up their minds lo maintain their previous mode ot living 
But lie did note some changes. 
" I I b in k it smoothes out the rough spots iii a m arriag e," he says “ You know, many of Hie problems of m a r­ riage can be caused by a lack of mon ey. It s easier to smile if you have a little money." 
Fate and money play all kinds of tricks with human lives. Harry Ward 
Casey Jr., 55, was Pennsylvania’s first vv iii tier. His wife was stric k en with cancer and died eight months later 
"I was a little resentful at first that fate was so cruel to give me the money hut take away my wife. But you have to re m e m b e r we had eig h t p le a s a n t months together we wouldn’t have had if it hadn t been for the money. My winning seemed to rejuvenate her.” 
For all their complaints about being badgered for money, the winners show a re m a rk a b le lack of s e lfis h n e s s , especially toward their fam ilies and friends. 
L ester S ites, HI, who liv e s n e a r 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., bought his two sons traetor-trailer rigs, no small expense lint an investment in their future. He hunts, fishes and is rem odeling his home, but he spends most of his money on Ins children and grandchildren. 
(ins Cosearclla is 79. He already had retired from barbering in Philadelphia when he won the lottery two years ago. lh* still cuts hair for his friends, for free. 
He’s a b achelor, lives in a sm a ll apartment behind his barber shop. His only extravagances were a new ear, which he drives to church on Sunday, and a planned trip to Rome. 
Otherwise he gives most of his mon­ ey to family and friends. He had a chance to win another $1,ooo on a lot - tory' ticket and tried to give it away but the state wouldn’t let him. So he told them to tear it up. All it m eant was more taxes. 

"I spend most of my tim e in here 
With the people I know,” he says in his little shop. " I ’m pushing 8o years old. I use the money just to make somebody else happy ... Someone tells you ‘I need this and I need that.’ So if you can help them, you help them. 
"I enjoy the sm iles.” 
Speed: Just plain crazy 

An usual, the overtaking car raced past us. 

“ Drivers are crazy,” my wife M ar­ garet observed. She does not u n d er­ stand our obsession with speed nor our reaction to natural laws restraining it. 
When only our lives were threatened, we blithely drove 9o mph or better. 
Then it cost money to drive fast; the frugal slowed down. 
Speed for speed s sake. M argaret declares, is just plain silly.

P rotocol o f parental prudery 

WASHINGTON - In the good old days when your (laughter said she was bringing home a friend for the weekend, it m eant she was bringing home a girl­ friend — and when your son said he was bringing home a friend for the weekend it was a boy. 

This is not the case anymore and it is causing tremendous bouseguest prob­ lems throughout the country. 
Since there is never any mention of the sex of the friend on the phone, most parents don’t know what to expect or how to handle it. 
I was over at R ip le y ’s house the other evening when his (laughter Joan, arrived home for the weekend with her 
" f r i e n d . ’’ a tall s tr a p p in g fellow named Mickey. 
Mrs. Ripley was very flustered and said. "Well. Mickey. I guess you want to put your things away." 
"P u t them in my room.” Joan said. 
"M ick ey can sleep in the a t tic ." 
Mrs. Ripley said nervously. 
“Why can’t he sleep in my room ?” 
Juan asked. Mr. Ripley blew up. "Be-

C cause I know he’d rather sleep in the attic.” 
" J o a n ’s room is fine with m e ," 
Mickey said. 

“ Well, it isn’t fine with m e," Mr. 
Ripley snarled. "Mickey, do you mind if we talk to Juan alone? There s a beer in the ice box. M ake y o u rs e lf at home.” 
As soon as Mickey left the room, 
Joan said, "How could you humiliate me in front of my friend?” 
“ How did we humiliate you?” Mrs. 
Ripley wanted to know. 
"Bv asking Mickey to sleep in the attic when you know perfectly well there are two beds in my room .” 
" I t ’s not a question of the num ber of 

 beds,” Mr. Ripley puffed. "T h ere’s a certain propriety about people sharing rooms when they’re not m arried.” 
"W hat propriety?” Joan wanted to know. 
Mrs. Ripley said, " I know w e’re old-fashioned and out of date, but your father and I get very nervous when we know two unmarried people of the op­ posite sex are in the sam e room under our roof.” 
" B u t 
M ickey and 
I a r e n ’t strangers,” Juan protested. “ Where do you think we live in Cam bridge?” 
“ I don’t want to know where you live in C am b rid g e. Y ou’re not in C a m ­ bridge this weekend! Y ou’re in our house!” Mr. Ripley yelled, 
"I thought it was my house, too,” 
Juan said. 

“ It is your house, dear — but if s not Mickey’s house. After all. it would seem to me you would enjoy one week­ end sleeping alone in your own room,” 
Mrs. Ripley said. 
“ If I’d known this was going to be such a big d e a l ," Jo a n sa id , " I wouldn’t have come home.” 
" I t ’s not a big deal,” said Mr. Ri­ pley. “ It’s a simple question of moral 

 standards. Ours seem to be different from yours. They may not be better but they are different.” 

“ And that’s why you want to ruin our weekend?” Jean asked. 

“ We’re not trying to ruin your week­ end, d ear,” Mrs. Ripley said. "W hat w e’re offering you are sep arate but equal accommodations. That’s all the 
Supreme Court asks of any of us.” 

" T h a t ’s very fu n n y ," Ju an said. 
" B u t all th e way down in th e c a r 
Mickey was counting on sleeping in my room He wouldn’t have come if he had known he had to sleep in the attic.” 
Mr. Ripley said, “ He’ll sleep in your room over my dead body.” 
I decided to intercede. “ I have a suggestion. Since Mickey was counting on sleeping in Joan’s room, why don't you let him sleep there and have Joan sleep in the attic?” 
All three looked at me. 
Then Mr. Ripley said, “ Wait a m in­ ute. Suppose Juan decides to com e down from the attic in the middle of the night?” 
" I t’s sim ple,” I said. "M ake Mickey promise to lock his door.”

LITTON offers the first microwave range with an eye­ level microwave, one-piece smooth top cooking surface a n d self-cleaning electric oven 
Microwave cuts electrical usage 

M icrow ave ovens can reduce the electrical energy consumed for cook­ ing by as much as 75 per cent, accord­ ing to Joe D. Eisenberg, president of 
Central Distributing Co., regional dis­ tributor for Litton Cooking Products. 
“ In addition to cutting costs sub­ stantially, energy-saving m icrowave ovens shorten cooking tim e and keep the kitchen cool.” he said. 
‘•Microwave ovens use about i 4 the kilow atts of a conventional electric range and cook the food without heat­ ing the kitchen.” 
Engineers and home economists at 
Litton estim ate that a family of four using a microwave oven to prepare all th eir m eals will consum e about 3oo kilowatt hours per year. 

This com pares with 1.175 kwh per year for cooking with a conventional electric range, according to the Elec­ tric Energy Association of New York. 
“ Cooking in a microwave oven is done in a fraction of the tim e.” Eisen­ berg noted. “ For example, you can cook ham burgers in five minutes in a 
Litton microwave ov en versus about 15 m inutes in a conventional oven. 
“ Or cook corn on the cob with a m icrowave oven in five minutes, in­ stead of boiling.”

G eneral E le c tric Co. has introduced two “ m i­ crow ave cooking een- ters"w hich offer the la­ test microwave features in addition to a conven­ tional self-cleaning elec­ tric oven. 
W ithout sa c rific in g needed c o u n te r space, h o m e m a k e rs can now replace an existing free­ standing range with GK’s new Hi-Lo model,jot- an existing wall oven with 
G E’s new double-oven built-in. 
Both feature an eye­ level upper 1.3 cubic* foot m icrowave and a lower co n v e n tio n al e le c tric oven. Both ovens in both m odels have full-width black g la ss doors with se e -th ro u g h oven w in­ dows. 
They m ix or m atch w itll other appliance co­ lors and a variety of kit­ chen decorating schemes from colonial to contem­ porary. 
The bu ilt-in cooking center is designed to re­ place e x is tin g 27-inch wide double wall ovens with only minor modifi­ cations, while the free­ standing cooking center can replace most 3o-inch w hie ranges. 

The m icro w av e oven used in both microwave cooking c e n te rs offers both tim e and tem p era­ ture controlled cooking. 
There s a fiO-minule digi­ tal tim er for those foods p rep ared best by tim e, and GE's exclusive auto­ matic control for accur­ ate tem perature of many foods to the desired serv­ ing temperature. 

An electronic tem pera­ tu re p robe may be inserted into the food and connected to an outlet on the oven wall. Tilt* user then selects the internal te m p e r a tu r e d e sire d , se ts the pow er and punches the start button. 
When cooking is com­ plete, the oven turns it­ self off and audibly sig­ nals the homemaker.

GENERAL ELECTRIC microwave ovens offer the exclusive automatic chef feature which allows the homemaker to cook according to temperature as well as time. It utilizes an internal probe which plugs into the wall of the unit to determine internal cooking temperature. 
When the food reaches the desired serving temperature, the oven turns itself off automatically.

Area W oolco stores feature gifts for mom 

The five San Antonio Woolco stores are offering a variety of gifts Mom is sure to enjoy on her special day. 
While Wooko may not bt* thought of primarily as an appliance store, it offers a wide selection of both large and small appliances designed to make life simpler for the modern home­ maker who doesn't have extra time to spend in the kitchen. 
/ 
Wooko offers free citywide delivery and does not charge extra for color appliances, noted David Urdialcs, re­ gional manager of major appliances. 
“We carry quality merchandise at competitive prices,” he added. “ Satis­ faction is graranteed.” 

Urdialcs also pointed out the number of name brands Woolco carries, among them BCA, General Electric, Whirl­ pool, Tappan, Eureka, Hoover, Zenith, 
Sanyo, Sound Design, Cobra, Pana­ sonic and Audition, Woolen s own brand. 

Later this month Woolco will be opening a new store at Marbach and 
Loop 41o to further serve its San An­ tonio customers. 
Currently there are Woolen stores at 
2214 SW Military Dr., Wonderland

Founding mothers stressed education 

Behind every great man is a great wo­ man. 
That's what any self-respecting, child-rearing, had working female knows. And that’s probably what the majority of the 38 presidents’ mothers would have said in their time. 
Surprisingly, the 38 women who earned the dis­ tinction of being called “ mother” by an American president were not that much different from Amer­ ican mothers today. 
What mother today doesn’t dream of giving her chikdren opportunities for the best of everything life has tooffer? 
What mother today hasn t looked at the impres­ sive track record of some public figure and won­ dered what it would take for her own children to achieve similar success? 
Is there a success formula for the “ making of the president?” 
A look back at these 38 women reveals that there is no guidebook written on the subject of rearing a public leader. 
Education 

In fact, the presidents’ mottlers have very few tilings in common. There was on striking similarity, however — an enormous interest in their own edu­ cations. 
Somehow, most presidential mothers secured an

 education, no matter how tough it was for them. I ii fact, a woman who became one of the most inter­ esting thinkers and accomplished writers of her day, 
Abigail Adams taught herself. She had no formal education, yet became a true scholar. 
The majority of these women performed their 
“ woman’s” work exceptionally well. Most became the real source of strength and inspiration for their sons during the most impressionable periods of their lives. 
It s interesting to note the different ways each great man remembered mama and how much credit he gave her for his success. 
Harry Truman never missed a Mother’s Day visit 
— and one year when he couldn’t make it because of his presidential responsibilities — he ordered the presidential plane to fly his mother lo Washington for their usual get-together. 
Ile often said of her, “ She’s wonderful. They don’t make them like that anymore!" 
And Lincoln, whose mother died when he was quite young, remembered her enough to say, “ All that I am or ever hope to be, I get from my mother.” 
Mother’s Day is the time to express personal feedings of appreciation for our mothers and all the special women who are important in our lives, We

Mother 

If y o u ’re not a mother yet but are looking forward to becoming one short­ ly, then this 
M other’s Day has special meaning for you. 
E xpectant women, awaiting the birth of that first child, are u n d e r­ standably excited about the prospects of being a mother for the first time. 
Because the m other- to-be wants her baby to be healthy and happy, she is also concerned about her diet. Experts warn that now- is not the time to listen to advice from well-meaning fami­ ly and friends. 
Doctor 
The expectant m o th e r’s doctor is the best judge of. the. mother-to-be’s diet plan, of course, but there are basic nutrition guidelines that she can follow. 
Nutrition experts point out that d urin g p re g ­ nancy eating the right kind of foods is especially important because your baby is growing every day within your body. 
You’ll want to m ake sure your infant has all the nutrients it needs to develop. 
Your diet should in­ clude milk, green leafy vegetables such as spin­ ach, lettuce, and peas, yellow vegetables such as carro ts, squash and sweet potatoes as well as citrus fruits and vegeta­ bles. 
Lean meat 
Lean meats and fish, enriched or whole grain cereal, and enriched or whole grain bread are' also musts in on your diet. 
While eating for two, say nutrition experts, it’s important to remember that the expression doesn’t mean you're sup­ posed to eat twice as much as you usually do. 
What e ating for two actually means is eating the right kind of food for yourself and your baby. 
Happy M other’s Day, mother-to-be!

Spinster wanted day fo r mothers 

Children began honoring their mothers in 1914 when President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second Sunday in May “a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of 
America.” 
The campaign for a national observance devoted to mothers was started by Anna M. 
Jarvis, a spinster who was concerned that so many adults neglect their mothers until it is too late. 
As a result of her work. Sen Sheppard of 
Texas, along with an Alabama colleague, intro­ duced a resolution in Congress on May 7, 1914 to set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother’s 
Day. 
Two days later the President issued his proclamation and urged the stars and stripes be flown on this holiday. 
Celebration became widespread. Today gift buying for Mother’s Day is second only to 
Christmas shopping. 
Presidents 
Continued from Page IM look for the most effective, warm and honest way to convey the things we never got to say during the year. 
For the past 2oo years, mothers have kept America changing, thinking and filled with capable men and women who've held it together. The tradition won t stop here. 
It continues with the strength of women like Gar­ field’s mother who sewed for the village shoemaker in exchange for her family’s shoes, and plowed her own fields, clipped sheep and carded wool for her family’s survival. 
The tradition continues, fostered by the early independent thinking of women like Abigail Adams, whose ideas about the low position women were held in, although considered radical at the time, are realistic today. 
What can a mother today do to put her mark on 
America’s future? 
Beyond a concern about her own independence, and that of her children she has what seems to be a confusing number of child-rearing theories to choose from. 
Perhaps, one presidential mother had the right advice, ‘‘You have to tend to the roots as well as the stems, and slowly and carefully plant ideas and concepts of right and wrong . . . and social implica­ tions and applications.” 
Have a Happy Mother’ s Day!

LEONARD A. VALVERDE, Ph.D. 
Communication key to Valverde’s role 

Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S—- Sunday May I 1977 

In the late ’6os the high school walk­ outs began in East L A. From that time on Vaiverde started organizing, meeting with people and discussing their problems. “ The most important thing I felt I was doing was talking to them and understanding them and be­ coming a part of them,” he says. 
Valverde’s goal was higher educa­ tion but his immediate task was to return to where he came from to try to correct communication problems that, existed. Once this was done he would pursue teaching. 
Working with the community in 
California and offering his advice and direction he gave parents information on how the schools operate. They be­ gan participating in changes within the schools. He was instrumental in get­ ting more Mexiean-American princi­ pals in predominantly 
Mexican- 
American schools, and more bilingual teachers were being recruited. 

The “ Diez y Seis de Septiembre” 
(Mexico’s Independence Day) and the second most important holiday in 
Mexico, “ Cinco de Mayor’’ (May 5) got exposure. More cultural awareness programs were used in the schools. All of this was happening in the junior high school he and his parents had 

He adds that parental involvement is doing a lot for the future of the Mexi- can-American. Students and parents are becoming more expressive. He* says the key to success is the family and the individual; “ It all means a sense of belonging and believing in you 
— whether it’s be your mother or brother. Once someone believes in you then you will believe in yourself.’’ 
He is married to the former Josefina 
Guzman and they have two children. 
Leo, 5, and Marissa, 4. 
Church sets crafts event 

The Church of the Holy Spirit will hold a festival and arts and crafts show from noon to 8 p.m. May 15 on the church grounds, Blanco and Ramsey 
Roads. 

The festival will feature foods, rides, games and refreshments for the whole family. Area artisans and craftsmen will exhibit and sell their work. 

For further information, contact Bob 
Taylor, 342-2462. 

Leonard A. Vaiverde learned as a youngster that true com­ munication is essential to suc­ cess. 
Communication can mean encour­ agement, and he found encouragement and motivation at home but not in school. His junior high school teachers, he recalls, “ saw us just as students and not as people. They lacked that element of caring.” 
Encouragement, motivation and caring by way of communication have made Vaiverde not only a successful teacher and administrator but also a successful organizer and leader. 
At 33 he is an assistant professor in the Department of Educational 
Administration at the University of 
Texas at Austin. 
The native of Los Angeles comes from a family of two children. He recalls a happy childhood and receiv­ ing a lot of encouragement from his parents. “ They made a good team. I received a lot of motivation from my father. He had a lot of strength — both physical and mental. I admired him on how he made decisions and stood on his decisions. He always gave me good emotional support,” he said. 

Career choice 
Growing up in East Los Angeles, one of the biggest barrios in the U.S., and observing all the problems that existed within the school system gave Vai­ verde a deep desire to pursue a career in education. 
He had hoped to go into medicine but he was not sure if he had the ability. 
But in junior high school he began taking note of his teachers — even­ tually answering a lotof questions that had bothered him as a youngster. 
“ For example, how come the stu­ dents could never give excuses for be­ ing absent? We (the Mexicanos) had to get sick once in a while like all the rest.” But, he adds, the teachers didn't do much on their part to understand the students’ needs. He was realizing more and more all the things that were negative and 
“ destroying our self-concept.” . 
All of this eventually caused school walkouts. 
Vaiverde was anxious to improve the situation. After graduating from high school he enrolled in East Los Angeles 
Junior College obtaining his associate of arts degree in 1963; in 1966 he earned his bachelor of arts degree from Cali­ fornia State College in Los Angeles. 
In 197o he began working on his masters degree in school administra­ tion and a year later he enrolled at 
Claremont Graduate School under a 
Ford Fellowship. He earned his Ph.D. in educational administration in 1974. 
He pursued a doctorate because he had doubts about what he could do. He realized that it was not so much teaching the students that would cor­ rect the lack of communication, lack of sensitivity, and lack of understanding but teaching the teachers and princi­ pals. He raised his goals — always keeping the value of encouragement to people who had always been excluded. 

Understanding 

 attended. 
For two consecutive summers he or- § ganized “ Cultural Awareness In Ser­ vice” workshops for 6oo schools in Los 
Angeles School District. One thousand parents participated. He served as one of the area directors of this $1.5 million project. 

Leaves California 
When he left California he was serv- , ing as president of the East Los 
Angeles Chapter of Mexican-American 
Educators. 
In 1973 an offer came from UT-Aus- tin. “ Texas had always intrigued me because of the harsh conditions in education,” he said. In Texas he has been teaching educational administration, preparation of princi­ pals, supervisors and superintendents of public schools. 
Vaiverde is the first minority in educational administration at UT-Aus- tin. “ I am doing what I always wanted to do. .. . teach in a major university, in a department ranked nationally, and in a state where you have many Mexi­ canos.” 
He teaches six hours at the graduate level, does committee work, writing and research. 
In Texas, Vaiverde is one of the founders of the Texas Association of 
Chicanos in 
Higher 
Education 
(TACHE). “ When I arrived in Tex^s I found that there was no organization to talk about our concerns. Why weren't more minorities employed as profes­ sors, staff members or administrators? Why wasn't the curri­ culum including more ethnic studies? 
We needed a voice to solve these prob­ lems,” he said. 

People’s voice 

Vaiverde was going to be that voice. 
In February of 1975 the Texas Asso­ ciation of Mexican-American Educa- * tors and the Mexican American School 
Board Members sponsored a state­ wide conference on the Mexican- 
American child. 

Vaiverde was selected as chairman. * 
The first conference was held in San i 
Antonio in September 1975, and Val- i verde was elected president at the se- \ cond conference in Austin in October, ? 
1976. The third conference will be held in San Antonio in this August. TACHE now has representation in over IOO in­ stitutions of higher learning through­ out the state. 

Vaiverde says getting a Ph.D. is not his single most important accomplish­ ment. He sees it “ just as a stepping stone.” ifs a seersucker spectacular, save $8-$1o! 2-and 3-pc. pantsuits

RIO DF: JANEIRO. 
Brazil — As old-time* re­ sidents of Rio de Janeiro look around the town they call the “ City M arve­ lous” it som etim es seems as if the only fa­ mous landmarks left are 
Sugar l>oaf and Corcova- do’s Statue of Christ. 
Rio de Ja n e iro was once a leisurely city of trolley cars, .sidewalk cafes, second-hand book­ stores and elegant, gradceful buildings of two and three stories which dated from the 
18th and 19th centuries. 
Today all but two trol­ ley lines have d isa p ­ peared and buses belch diesel fumes in the faces of patrons of the sidewalk cafes. 
A spokesman for the 

 m ayor’s office, Ayrton 
Torquato, said he esti­ mated about 8o per cent of downtown Rio had changed completely in the last 2o years. There are no figures on the num ber of stately old buildings dem olished and replaced by skyscrapers. 
But he said newspapers continually c a rry ac­ counts of fam ous re s­ ta u ra n ts or old book­ stores wiped out by the path of progress. 
Replacements include the $2-million city cathe­ dral, a 
282-foot-high structure shaped like a rounded pyram id, and the starkly modern office building which houses 
Petrobras, Brazil’s state oil monopoly. 

Many fam ous and beautiful old buildings as well as parks have been demolished because they lie in the path of the city subway, now under con­ struction. 
Subway construction has so upset life in the 
“ City Marvelous” that it has become the theme of a television soap opera called “Two Lives.” 
The soap opera deals with the problem s of shopkeepers and ap a rt­ ment owners of limited resources who must move because of subway construction. 
The path of the Rio subway most often re ­ sembles the path of low level bombers — gaping holes and piles of rubble. 
But in Rio, citizens 

 shrug; something is al­ most always under con­ struction and residents are used to finding stre e ts and sidew alks blocked by boards and confusing wooden walk­ ways that resem ble a . children’s game or a rat m aze, w here once a tree-lined avenue exist­ ed. 

One of Rio’s most fa­ mous spots was Cinelan- dia, w here the best movie theaters were located along with sidewalk cafes and bars like the Amare- linho. 
Musicians, composers, and sin g ers used to gather there. It was a ’ peaceful, popular area graced by Portuguese mosaic sidewalks. 

Then came the subway and C inelandia d isa p ­ peared for three years in a gaping hole, and jan­ gling g u ita rs were re ­ placed by the thud of the pile driver. 

Construction was at last completed in Octo­ ber 1976 and a new Cine­ landia emerged. To old- time residents ifs just not the same but new­ comers find it a cheerful place of broad flower beds and replicas of old­ fashioned street lamps. 
Pigeons flock there and children play. 
The movie th eaters continue and their customers who stop af­ terward for a cold beer at an outdoor cafe have an excellent view of the re­

Our Big Brother is watching over us 

By ANN BAKER and JOHN FINNEGAN JR. 
The government information machine has a record on you. 
Not just one record. If you arc an average citizen, you probably appear in 111 to 2o federal files, according to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB). 
You also probably ap p ear in state 

 r in d local government files. How many d e p e n d s on w h ere you live. T he 
M in n eso ta D ata P riv a c y Unit e s ti­ mates the average resident is in 15 to 
JO state and local files. 
Even a partial list of governm ent rec o rd s includes; b irth , m a rria g e , d ea th , e d u catio n , d r iv e r 's license, public hospital. M edicare, m ilitary, veterans' benefits, civil service, land ownership, taxation. Social Security, welfare which accounts for IO per cent of all government records, unemploy­ ment com pensation, c rim e, courts, passports, FUA loans and on and on. 
Private industry 
And none of this includes inform a­ tion that private industry has on you: credit, bank, insurance and personnel records, for example. 
The federal government runs more than 8.ooo se p arate record system s, ti.OOO c o m p u te riz e d . And the c o m ­ p u te rs p ro c e ss in fo rm a tio n ut th e speed of IOO million calculations per second. 
'F in d in g out what inform ation the governm ent has on you can be diffi­ cult. G o v e rn m e n t ag e n c ie s a re r e ­ quired to print a list of their record systems in the Federal Register. But it is up to you to guess which of the more than 8,ooo listings contains information about you then file a request with the responsible agency. 
T he society ru n s on in fo rm atio n . 
Without it, decisions could not be made properly. Intelligent planning would be im p o ssib le . Society as we know it would fall apart. We need information to survive. 
But how much does the government need to know about you? What kind of information? How is it used? What are the hazards? 
Only in the past few years have law­ m akers started raising those questions and in some cases, pushing for laws to ensure an individual’s right to privacy. 
The legislators have found that; 
In c o m p le te a r r e s t re c o rd s have hounded people who never committed a crime, 
“ Less-than-honorable” military dis- 
. charges have blocked countless per- 
* sons from jobs, medical care and other 
» benefits even when the “ less-than- l honorable" tag has little relevance to 
* civilian life. 
False 
False information, biased informa- 
* tion, half-tru th s, innuendo and odd snips of information that paint a dis­ torted picture of you can whirl around the com puters forever and you might never know it. 
* 
The information in the records may br true. If the neighbors know such things, that is one m atter. They also have contact with the real you. But such data on a written or computerized file can be and sometimes is regarded 
JJS th e w hole tru th a b o u t you. It conveys the im pression of being for­ mal, official arui important.

 they receive from one another. 
Of 858 federal data hanks studied by th e S e n a te C o n s titu tio n a l R ig h ts subcommittee from 197o to 1974, nearly three-fourths were found to pick up a m ajority of th eir inform ation from other data hanks. Only 8 per cent re­ fused to give their data to other sys­ tems. 
Notified 

Some agencies like Internal Revenue and Selective Service, pledged to con­ fid e n tia lity , then went ah e ad an d passed information to other agencies, according to testimony before a Senate committee in 1974. it was found that fewer than one- third of those 858 data hanks notified people that inform ation about them was being collected. 
Law e n fo rce m e n t ag en cies t r a d i ­ tionally have opened their crim inal history files to certain employers and private detectives. Ten per cent of those records arc thought to contain false information. 
Social work agencies have done the sam e for one another, often swapping notes over the phone with schools and probation offices too. 
Typically, such sharing is said to be 
“ for the client’s own good." Typically, the client knows nothing about it. 
One of the most frequently shared data banks is the driver’s license file including such information as name, address, eye color, hair color, etc. In 
M innesota, the files are open to the public. In addition, 14 federal and 5o state agencies have “ on-line" access to the files, m eaning they can punch a nam e into a com puter term inal and 

 make the license file appear on a TV- like screen. These files also are shared with 113 private organizations, many of which compile mailing lists from the information. 
Information is gathered by govern­ ment to help you, police you or for no apparent ri'ason at all. Many subjects of intelligence files, in particular, find it hard to swallow assurances that no­ body is "out to get them ,” whether to enhance personal prestige, secure a political position or stifle dissent. 
Exactly what is the right to privacy? 
“ T he w ord ‘p r iv a c y ’ m ay he a m isnom er,” said Louis Higgs, deputy executive director of the national P ri­ vacy Protection Study Com m ission. 
“ Once y ou’ve collected inform ation about someone, his right to be let alone is rendered moot.” 
Higgs said that if we accept the idea that government has a right to collect information to adm inister legitim ate social p ro g ram s, “ then the privacy issue becom es one of record-keeper responsibility.” 
Elliot Richardson, former secretary of health, education and welfare, told a congressional committee: “ The objec­ tive should not be to assure that the individual is let alone, but rather to assure that he can participate in de­ termining how he will be affected by records.” 
Concern over the go v ern m en t r e ­ cords surfaced during the past decade through two chains of events. 
The first was a series of concerted efforts by government bureaucrats to com puterize all their information on citizens in one huge central data bank. 
The second was the story of military

 and law enforcement agencies' spying on peace and civil rights activists. 
The central computer plan cam e to light in 1985, when the Social Science 
Research Council urged Congress to have the Bureau of the Budget estab­ lish a national Data Center to improve governm ent efficiency and prom ote research. 
But as congressional hearings re ­ vealed, the central information system co n tain ed few privacy sa fe g u a rd s. 
Though the information was supposed to be assem bled for sta tistica l p u r­ poses only, it would have been possible to trace the identity of citizens. The proposal was abandoned in a storm of public and congressional criticism. 
Didn’t give up 

The federal government did not to­ tally give up plans to centralize re ­ cord-keeping, however. The General 
Services A dm inistration (OSA), in 
1974, planned to link all of the federal governm ent’s computers with a $2oo million m essage-switching program dubbed “ FED N ET.” 
It would have allowed a lot of small computers to act like one big one. Each governm ent agency could have had easy access to another’s information. A 
CSA em ploye blew the w histle and 
Congress cut off funding. 
The picture of governm ent spying started em erging in 197o. On Dec. I, 
Richard Kasson said in an NBC tele- vision new s b ro a d c a st th a t he had worked as a spy for the U.S. A rm y’s 
U3th Military Intelligence Group sta­ tioned at FT. Snelling, Minn. 
He said he helped compile a secret card file on 5,ooo to 8,ooo Minneapo- lis-St. Paul residents, many of whom opposed the war in Vietnam. Kasson said later that he worked closely with 
University of Minnesota police and re­ cord keepers and regularly obtained the files of s tu d e n ts and facu lty members. 
Subsequent hearings by U.S. Sen. 
Sam Ervin’s subcommittee on consti­ tutional rights showed that what mili­ ta ry in te llig e n c e was d o in g in 
Minnesota was only the tip of the ice­ berg. 
Enemies list 
Inform ation on h u ndreds of thou­ sands of Americans in many cities was collected and forw arded to M ilitary 
Intelligence Com m and h eadquarters at FT. Holabird, Md. Ervin’s subcom­ mittee was never able to determ ine exactly why the information was being gathered. 
Later, during the Watergate scandal. it was rev ealed th a t the P re s id e n t himself had compiled a list of people whom be considered his personal poli­ tical enemies. The plan was to mobi­ lize the full power of the government inform ation m ach in e to destroy the integrity and credibility of the people on the list. 
C ongress had alre ad y passed two laws dealing with the vast store of in­ formation collected by the government, acting following the U.S. 
Senate’s 1964-66 hearings on electronic surveillance and wiretapping. 
The Freedom of Information Act be­ cam e law in 1967, with the intent to guarantee to the public and the press access to a wide variety of government information. It was one way the media could hold government accountable for its activities. 
The second law, the Fair Credit Re­ porting Act of 197o, allowed citizens

 access to personal information about them held by credit firms. It also gave citizens the right to correct misinfor­ mation in credit files. 
But there was no groat public outcry for privacy laws to cover the m ass of personal files held by g overnm ent, said m an y m e m b e rs of a national 
Conference on State Privacy and F'air 
Information Practices, which m et in 
St. Paul last year. 
“ It was a popular issue, hut never really caught on with the public,” said 
Chuck Mobley, chief consultant for 
C a lif o r n ia ’s In fo rm a tio n S y stem s 
Implementation Committee. 
D em ands for p riv ac y law s ca m e mostly from two sources: politicians and groups of computer exjierts such as the National Association of State 
Inform ation System s (NASIS), who feared overly restrictive laws on the use of computers. 
“ A num ber of us have decided that if we’re going to have privacy laws, let’s have so m e le g isla tio n that m a k e s sense," said Daniel Magraw, a former president of NASIS. 
The U.S. Senate held h earings in 
1971 and again in 1974. The National 
Academy of Sciences published an ex­ haustive study, “ Databanks in a Free 

Society” in 1972. The Health, E duca­ tion and Welfare Department followed with its own report in 1973, ‘‘Records, 
Computers and the Rights of Citizens.” 
None of the reports showed tin* exis­ tence of any birth-to-deuth dossiers on 
American citizens, but each Warm'd of potential abuses and documented questionable record-keeping practices of th** go v ern m en t inform ation m a ­ chine. 
In April 1974, Minnesota became th** first state in the nation to enact a pri­ vacy law. Seven states and the federal government have followed suit A fe­ deral and a num ber of state privacy commissions were formed to monitor the law s’ effectiveness i i i protecting the public’s right to privacy. 
Legal problems 
S tate and fe d e ra l s o u rc e s a g r e e however, that a cloud of unexpectedly co m p lex legal an d a d m in is t r a tiv e problem s — further com plicated by the use of com puters — have settled around the laws. 
Confusion developed when a few states and the federal government took an “ om nibus" approach and tried to 
Cram into the laws as many privacy- related issues as possible.

ANSWER: 
Mostly [also! Assum ing the card issuer com plies with certain statutory requ ire­ ments, under federal consumer credit laws the card holder could be liable for $5o of the thief’s purchases made prior to the issuer being notified of the theft. If the issuer is notified before the thief goes on his spree, the card holder would not be liable at all. 
Since most people carry m ore than one card, the $5o liability can mount up. Insur­ ance can be obtained against such loss, so­ metimes as part of a homeowner s liability policy. Many card issuers, however, waive the $5o liability.

Frost out to trap Nixon 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday May I I 9 77 
Page I -P 

W ASHING TO N p o s t s e r v ic e 
WASHINGTON - R i­ chard M. Nixon faces an­ other c risis this week, one of his own m aking and one from which he profits personally. 
He returns to public view Wednesday night in the first of a series of televised interviews with 
David Frost and answers care fully plotted qu es­ tions about his Watergate role. 
F ro st's clear strategy. as shown in internal me­ m oranda and p re lim in ­ ary scripts of the Water­ gate show obtained by 
The W a sh in g to n Post 
Service, was deliberately to confront Nixon with new and dam aging infor­ mation. 
T he p ro g ra m is de­ signed to lead Nixon on and trap him into adm is­ sions of guilt or at least c o n c e ssio n s of error. 
Nixon is reported to be receiving $65o,ooo for his interviews. 
Trial 
“ We looked upon the 
Watergate taping as the trial Nixon never had.” said Robert ,Zelnick, edi­ tor in chief of the Frost production team. 
“ W e tried to look at ourselves as senior liti­ gation partners in a law firm . B ut we knew we could ask questions and draw legal conclusions at tim es that a prosecutor can't draw in court. We knew we could uee cer­ tain internal legal a n a ­ lyses and blast him with it. W e w ere in close touch, you know, w ith m any of the people who had prosecuted the W a­ tergate trials.” 
How well F ro st's plan works will not be known until Wednesday, but the way the program was put together belies e a rlie r published reports about it b e in g a “ s o f t " e n ­ counter. 
There is also nothing soft about the m erchan­ d isin g of the Nixon pro­ gram . It s hard-sell all the way. A s Nixon pre­ pares to enter our living room s via T V for the first tim e after nearly three y e a rs of exile, his a p ­ pearance already is gen­ erating headlines, news leaks and cover stories. 
Inside 
Out in California. Time m agazine has the inside track, but Newsweek is 

Frost's clear strategy teas deliberate­ ly to confront Nixon aith new and d a rn agt ng iuforma t io n 

 standing close by. One of 
T im e ’s reporters. John 
Stacks, has had access to the inner w orkings of the show. He reportedly is be in g g ive n advance 
N ixo n m ate rial. N e w s­ week, show sources say. also will get a share of the tidbits. And M ik e 
Wallace of C B S 's 6o M in ­ utes also has been given an inside look, it is said. 
A s an exercise in m e­ dia hype. N ixo n ’s em er­ gence from the shadows of San C lem en te is a c la ssic in the ge nre of promotion. 
Yet. according to the availab le evidence and tht1 words of the program principals, the Frost ef­ fort has been an intensely se rio u s one — both in strategy and content. 
Those w orking on the p ro g ra m plotted, re­ searched, uncovered new material, delved into his b a ck gro u n d , exp lored questions about his sex life, compiled a personal 
‘ * psycho- h i story. ” ta! ked to doctors, psychiatrists, pyschohistorians, and in­ terviewed a host of fam i­ liar names from the Wa­ tergate period. 
John 
Dean and Fred Buzhardt, 
Bob Woodward and Law­ rence Bigb y were am ong them. 
From the material, and from the lines of ques­ tio n in g su g g e ste d by m any of those principal 
W atergate actors, emerged the strategy of trying to trap Nixon. 
Script 
F'or instance: F ro st s 
W atergate script draft, obtained by T he Post, ca re fu lly sp e lls out a series of suggested ques­ tions. Frost is urged to pursue a relentless string of questions on subject after subject. 
On the no to rio u s 
1812-minute gap in a cri­ tical Watergate tape, the questions flow b riskly. 
D id N ixo n erase that tape? D id n ’t he discuss other crim inal activities on that ta p e? D oes he mean that his aides e r­ ased the tape? And so on. 
But if none of these questions elicits a satis­ factory response, the script advises this course 

 for Frost: 
“ A ssu m in g the worst. that R ich a rd offers no explanation for the 18*2 m in u te s, and that, fu rth er, he m a in ta in s that he had no interest this early in a cover-up. 
David will keep the fol­ lowing as a final back-up. 
— H is excerpts from an­ other c o n ve rsa tio n on 
June 2o, this time with 
Charles Colson, and these co m m e n ts have never been m ade public. It sho w s 
N ixo n ta lk in g about ‘stonew alling’ for the first time, and about 
‘leaving this where it is 
— with the Cubans.' “ 
Sprung 

The scrip tw riter then instructs Frost. “This is a trap for N ixo n , and should be sprung deftly.” 
The Colson-Nixon con­ versations were am ong p re v io u sly undisclosed tra n sc rip ts the F ro st staff uncovered. 
Not the least of the fascination with the way the p ro g ra m s were fa­ shioned concerns the pri­ vate advice give n by a number of Watergate era principals. 
All of those interviews by the Frost staff suppo­ se d ly w ere to be kept confidential. The staff it­ self w as aske d to sig n co n fid e n tia lly clauses. 
Not S u r p ris in g ly , that 
“ p riv a te ” m a te ria l is leaking. 
Som e of those in te r­ view s offer an iro n ic commentary. John Dean, for one. The memo about 
Dean s interview of last 
December begins, “John 
Dean has the a ir of a te le visio n p e rso n a lity now. lie 's deeply tanned and w e ll-d re sse d and su rrou n d e d by lite rary age n ts and te levision producers.” 
W hen 
F r o s t ’s staff asked 
Dean w hat he w ould a sk N ixo n now. 
Dean’s reply imm ediate­ ly cam e back. “ Dean answered that he would like to be in our shoes. 
That ra th e r than a friendly chat with Nixon. he would like to be his interrogator. 
Lust sum m er, du rin g lunch with two mem bers 

 of the W atergate prose­ cution staff, Richard Ben 
V e n iste and 
G eorge 
F ra n kto n , the Frost re­ searchers were told, “ By way of general advice on 
N ixo n in te rro ga tio n . 
Fram pton suggested the technique of placing the worst construction on the facts of Watergate as we know them and then de­ v is in g a line of questioning intended to disclose the truth.” 
And. “ Ben Veniste also noted that a c la ssic lawyer questioning or in­ terrogation techique was to em body insin uation s and questions. Example: 
M r. Nixon, is there any question in y o u r m ind that the money was being used to buy sile n c e ? 
W hen did you first be­ com e aw are that the money was being used to buy silence?” 
With Ph ilip Lacovara, also of the prosecution staff: “ On taxes, he re­ called that Nixon said ... he would voluntarily pay the IR S $4oo,ooo oh one year and $.‘1oo,ooo on an­ other (back taxes) and thought it would be in­ te re stin g to hear what 
Nixon has to say on w hy he has not done that.” 
Higby 

With Lawrence Bigby, 
H ald e m an ’s form er P R a ssista n t: “ B ig b y felt 
Watergate program was potential for significant journalism if we do not let Nixon talk (he states 
Nixon is a good talker) but do som e interspers­ ing and reporting on go­ ings-on at the time in tile 
W hite H o use and C o n ­ gre ss. Be said (B o u se 
J u d ic ia ry 
C o m m ittee 
Chairm an Peter W.) Ro- dine was sim ply the dupe for Phil Burton, who was really ru n n in g the im ­ peachment hearings, and 
Tip O'Neill, and that we sh o u ld trace m o tiv a ­ tions.” 
With Buzhardt, Nixon’s form er counsel: “ Nixon was a m an who alw ays put on a great front, to 
B u zh a rd t. 
W h ile the tapes reveal indecisive­ ness, vacillation, in other situ a tio n s, not W a te r­ gate-related, he could be decisive and incisive. Not that in his decisive mood he w as a lw a y s adm irable. Be often put up a hard front but after he lost his temper and . I. came down hard on pen-

 pie. he could be com pas­ sionate afterwards.” 

A m o n g other in te r­ vie w s were those with 
Dr. David Abraham sen, author of a book “ Nixon vs. Nixon,” and Dr. A r ­ nold Butschnecker. who had treated Nixon off and on beginning in 1952, and 
Fawn Brodie, the writer now w o rk in g on a p sy ­ chobiography of Nixon. 

A b ra h a m se n and 
B ro d ie both told the 
Frost interv iewer. Jam es 
Reston Jr., a p ro g ram editor, that N ixon w as 

 the m ost co m p lica te d m an they had studied. 
Brodie helped form sug­ gested questions for the show. 
“ A n y m ate ria! that 
D a v id could induce on the w e llsp rin g s of this m an,” her interview ac­ count reads, “ his father and m other. his daughters, and particu­ la rly the e a rly c ris e s during N ixon’s life such as the death of his two brothers, would be enor­ m o u sly valuab le to all future b io g ra p h ie s of 
Nixon.”

San Antonio EXPRESS N E W S — Sunday M ay I 1977 

The* copier is similar to the Savin 77o but also in­ cludes a semi-automatic document feeder. 
The machine makes first copies in 4.5 se­ conds, compared to ap­ proximately eight se­ conds in sim ilar competitive machines. 
The Savin 78o has bins for both letter and legal size paper and a switch in paper size may be made by moving an ex­ terior lever. 
The machine turns off automatically after fin­ ishing and requires no warm-up time. It runs only when in use. 
The 78o can print on both sides of a sheet of paper and feeds printed side up. 
The cover is counter balanced to stay at auv height it is placed. Books and bound materials may be copied. 
Unusual 
An unusual feature is the ability to produce transparencies for over­ head projectors. 
Gummed labels and color stock may also be copied. 
An adjustable darkness switch is included and the Savin 78o will print up to 2o copies of a docu­ ment at a time. 
The Savin 77o is basi­ cally the same machine without the semi-auto­ matic paper feeder. It may. however, be con­ verted to a 78o with the attachment of such a de­ vice. 
Copy Distributing Co. sells and services photo­ copy and word process­ ing equipment by Savin 
Business Machines as well as A poco Corp. pho­ tocopy equipment. 
Formed 
The firm was formed 
15 years ago. Last .lune it bought out the Apeco factory branch in San 
Antonio. 
Savin equipment has been placed in some of the largest companies in 
San Antonio, including major insurance and stock brokerage firms, as well as two miltitary in­ stallations. according to 
Weldon Mora, Copy Dis- trinuting sales manager. 
“ The Savin 78o is the most reliable piece of equipment on the mar­ ket.” said C. Graygor, president of Copy Distri­ buting Co. 
Quoting from a Savin stockholder report, lie referred to the develop­ ment of the machine as one of the most signifi­ cant advances in the his­ tory of Savin. “ It makes 

C. G R A YG O R , president of Copy Distri­ buting, discusses sales reports with his secretary, Patti Barnard 

 multiple copies faster than most competitive machines.” said Gray­ e r . 
Office Products Ana­ lysts rated the Savin TTO 
“ number one” in cost performance analysis and offered its highest recommendation, ac­ cording to Mora. 
Adm inistrative Man­ agement called the Savin 
75o, forerunner of the 77o, 
I he “ apparent pace set­ ter" of the 4o plain paper copiers marketed follow­ ing a 1975 federal Trade 
Commission consent order. 
“ Reliability is the rea­ son." Mora read. 
Graygor recommends the Savin 78o for medium to high demand, from 
2.ooo to 5o.ooo copies per month. 
Mora added that 8o.ooo 
Savin machines were 

 placed in 197o. almost as many as their two top competitors combined. 
“ We’ve been on an al­ located situation for the past 18 months,” said 
Graygor to explain why his company had not promoted the machine previously. 
Back ordered 
“ Everything we sold was back ordered. A se­ cond manufacturing plant was opened in Ir­ vine. Calif., which will increase production in the U.S. by 5o per cent, allowing us to take a more public marketing approach.” 
Copy Distributing Co. is the exclusive Savin dealer in San Antonio. 
Total sales exceeded $1 million in 1976 and are anticipated to reach $2 million in fiscal 1977, 
Mora noted.

NFL tunes up to pick i ts favorite him 

By HARRY PAGE 

O F THE EXPRESS N E W S STAFF 
San Antonio could have three, and possibly four, players chosen in the first-round of the 
National Football League’s draft 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 

The general consensus is that Rice’s 
Tommy Kramer, formerly of Lee, and 
Baylor’s Gary Green from Sam Hous­ ton will go in the first round. 
But what about Texas A&I’s George 
Franklin from Sam Houston and Eas­ te rn New M exico’s R u ssell T a tu m from Jay? 
Franklin is definitely the sleeper, 
“ Everybody has been talking and asking about PYanklin.” said A&I’s 
Coach (iii Steinke. “ I feel he will go real high in the draft — possibly in the first round.” 
“ Dallas told m e that they want to get 

TOMMY KRAMER 

Ricky Bell (Southern Cal) or Tony 
Dorsett (P itts b u rg h ),” said the v er­ satile 6-4, 23o-pound Franklin. “ They told m e they would pick me if they didn’t get either of those two. 

“ It’s sort of an insult, but I guess I should be happy to even be in a posi- 

 him 

 tion to be d ra fte d . Not all college players are that fortunate.” Franklin has also been accosted by the New 
York Jets and the Giants. 
.Fred Bled, defensive coach at Eas­ te rn New Mexico, had nothing but p ra is e for T atu m , chosen E N M U ’s 
Most Valuable player. 
“ Thirty to 4o scouts have come by and asked about Russell. It looks like he might be picked in the middle to late rounds. Rounds three and four or above might be pushing it, but Russell should be picked six through eight. 
But, I don’t know, a lot of people are interested in him .” 
“ I really don’t have any idea where I will be chosen, if I ’m chosen,” said 
Tatum, a 225-pound fullback. “ I’ll just wait and see, Dallas has shown some in terest in me, and so has New O r­ leans.” 
K ram er and Green are confident of going in the first round. 
“ From all indications, I should go in the first round,” said the All-American 

GARY GREEN 

 q u a r te rb a c k . “ New Y ork (p ic k in g fifth) and Cincinnati (chosing third) are among the teams that might take me in the first round. 
“ But, all th*' team s have shown in­ te re s t in m e — H ouston, D allas, 
Denver, and Green Bay. It all depends on the progress of the draft and what 

 him 

 each team needs to help its program. I really don’t think ITI be the top choice for T a m p a will go for Kicky Bell. 
Seattle needs som e defensive people and the New York Jets have invested big money in Richard Todd. I really don’t know — you just can ’t tell who’ll take you. 
“ I haven’t discussed money yet with my agent Mike Thornell of Houston," 
K ram er added. “ I’m just going to wait and see what the team that picks me offers. Of course, I’m going to try and get as much as I can — you’ve got to go for it all.” 
“ I ’ve been told th at I should go pretty high in the first round and that’s what I’m looking fo r,” Green said. 
“ Kansas City, Seattle, the New York 
Jets and Giants, New Orleans, Cincin­ nati, and Atlanta are the team s that stick out in my mind that said they wanted me. 
“ S eattle m ay pick up D orsett be­ cause I feel like they need him, but, 
D orsett doesn’t want to go there. It

LEE TREVINO

Open lands 
Trevino 

Lee Trevino, the “ Merry 
Mexican” of the PGA Tour, this weekend in Houston told officials of the San Antonio 
Golf Association he fully in­ tends to make a run for the championship of the Texas 
Open this fall. 

Trevino passed the word to Arth­ ur Goerges, tournament manager of the Open scheduled Oct. 13-16 at 
Oak Hills country d u b . 
“ I’m definitely looking forward to coming back again,” said Trevino, a 
San 
Antonio gallery favorite of years past. 
“ I appreciated your letting me off the hook last year to go out of the country,” he added. 
Trevino skipped the 1976 Open in favor of playing in a tournament in 
Japan. 
Goerges also reported that Bruce 
Lietzke,- winner of two m ajor tour­ naments this year, also gave verbal assurance he will be among the pros teeing off at Oak Hills this fall. 

CHICAGO (AP) — Texas 
R an g er 
M an ag er' 
F ra n k 
Lucchesi was offered $1o,ooo by 
M. Donald Grant, president of the New York Mets, as an in­ ducement not to press charges against Lenny Randle, the Chi­ cago Tribune said in a copyr­ ighted story in its Sunday editions. 

L u c c h esi, who was a s s a u lte d by 
R andle on M arch 28 d u rin g s p rin g training, turned down the bid flatly, although he continues to m aintain a 
“ no com m ent” position on whether he intends to file suit against Randle, the 
Tribune story said. 
The Mets acquired Randle from the 
R angers last Tuesday and on Friday signed him to a five-year contract. 
L ucchesi, a p p a re n tly stu n n ed that word of his phone conversation leaked out, said he had intended that it re­ m ain confidential honoring G ra n t’s request. 
Corbett 

The Tribune said Lucchesi had told only Brad Corbett, board chairm an of the Texas club. Corbett, in Chicago for the Rangers series against the White 
Sox, said, “ Can you im agine G rant doing something like that?” 
Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, reached by the Tribune at his home outside New Y’ork City, expressed su r­ prise but declined comment. 
Kuhn told the T rib u n e , “ I know nothing about it, but I want to find out the details before I say anything.” 

The Tribune said Grant reportedly called Lucchesi F riday and told the 
Texas m a n ag e r that he (Lucchessi) had been through a lot and ought to be compensated. His offer grew’ out of the conversation, the Tribune said, and 
Grant suggested that Lucchesi sign an affidavit not to press charges in return for the compensation. 
No 

“ Right now there’s no way I can do that,” Lucchesi reportedly told Grant. 

Grant had asked Lucchesi to call him back after he had time to think it over, the Tribune said. 

“ I told him I ’d do him that co u r­ tesy,” said Lucchesi, indicating that as far as he was concerned there would be • nothing more to it.

KINGSVILLE — Team points were as scattered as the sights in the AAAA Di­ vision of the Boys Regional Track Meet 
Saturday at Javelina Stadium. 

Churchill and Marshal] shared the team title with 
35 points each, with four other team s, including 
Houston, finishing in a deadlock for second with 34 points.

In the AAA Division, a powerful 
Belton team rolled up 8o points to win, with G regory-Portland g ra b ­ b in g second at 62, follow ed by 
Southwest with 57. 
But in the skin-tight AAAA re­ gional title race, relays and double winners made all the difference. 
M arshall’s Randy Clay was one of the two double winners, taking the high hurdle in 14.1 and calling on his “ lucky” tee shirt and socks for a victory in intermediates. 
Going into the final hurdle, Clay was dead even with Corpus Christi Miller’s Gerald Allen and they

HOUSTON — Gene Littler birdied the par-five 16th hole after a eontrover- • sial shot into the green, finished out a five-under-par 67 and opened up a five-stroke lead over George Burns in Saturday’s third round of the $2oo,ooo 
Houston Open Golf Toirnament. 

Burns, who shared the second-round lead with Littler and was obviously angered when 
Littler hit into him on the 16th, dropped back with a par 72 under the gray clouds that

 threatened rain and leaked occasional drizzle. 
The 46-year-old Littler, winner of 28 tour titles, completed 54 holes in 2o2, 14 under par on the 6,997-yard Woodlands Country Club course. Burns, who blew a chance to gain his first tour title in this tournament a year ago, had a 2o7 total. 
There were two key holes — the sixth where Burns made double bogey six, and the par-five 
16th.

Lemon had dropped Bert Cam paneris’ fly ball in center field for an error. 
Henderson and Horton both homered in the eighth inning off W ilbur Wood, who was m aking his first appearance since M ay 9. 1976, when his left knee w as shattered by a line drive off the bat of Detroit’s Ron 
LeFlore. 
Henderson greeted Wood with an inside-the-park homer and after M ike H argrove had singled and 
Toby H arrah had walked, Horton hit the upper deck facade for his second homer. 
In between the home run barrage, Sandy Alom ar drove in three runs with a pair of singles and scored another. 
Tom m y B o g g s started for the R angers but was unable to get past the fourth inning when Lemon knocked him out with a two-run single. Nelson Brile s relieved and gained his second victory against no losses.

Denver will select me,” Green said. 
“ You never know about Seattle, they need so many things. 
“ I really haven’t talked about money yet. That will be de­ termined by the team that picks me — if a team can pay more, then me and my agent, 
Thomas _. _ 
Vaughn of Houston, 
I will ask for more. I 
D . rir would like to have a rAUK. long-term contract with an “ if” clause saying that the contract could be renegotiated after the first two years. I have all the confidence in the world that my agent will see me through.” 
Of course, there are some that may be selected low, or not at all. 
“ I think I ’ll be selected between the seventh, eighth and 12th rounds,” said 
Baylor’s all-conference guard Bell 
Tipton from MacArthur. “ From what some scouts tell me, 
I ’m rated between the 1oth and 14th best guard in the nation. I ’ve only heard from a couple of people. 
“ The team most interested in me is 
Green Bay. Cleveland and Atlanta are supposedly interested but I haven’t

 been contacted J>y them. Dallas has contacted me but that’s because the 
Cowboys are so thorough in their se­ lection procedures. 
“ if I should be drafted. I’ll negotiate the contract myself,” Tipton said, “ I don’t have an agent. What round I’m drafted in plus the position the team is in will determine contract talks, lf a team needs guards, then I ’ll be in a better position for negotiating.” 
“ I haven’t heard from the pros in a while,” said Sam Houston State's quarterback-defensive back Guido 
Merkens from Edison. “ If I’m selected it will be between the eighth and 12th rounds. Dallas did talk to me a lot.” 
People like Texas Tech’s Mike Sears

Stearns (Ja y ), A& l’s Larry Seidel 
(McCollum), West Texas State’s Tully 
Blanchard (Churchill) and A & l’s 
Larry McFarland (Highlands) may be overlooked because of size, height, or speed. Both Sears and Stearns have been contacted by Canadian Football 
League teams. Raymond Beverly of 
Army is committed to Uncle Sam. 
“ No one has talked to me, I guess my size is the knock,” Brown said. 
“ The last I heard, Washington was interested in me,” Seidel said. “ I ’m just sitting and waiting. I think things will go against me because I ’m a de­ 

 fensive lineman and, most of the time, the backs are choeen first. If McFar­ land gets a chance, hopefully I will too. 
I’m just sitting a waiting.” 
“ I really don’t know about McFar­ land,” Steinke said. “ Teams seem interested but I really don’t know if he’ll be drafted.” 
“ Six-two and 24o pounds is really small for a guard,” Sears said. “ If I get drafted, I will gladly except, lf I’m drafted at all it will be in the latter rounds because of my size — I would like to have the opportunity to be drafted because I’m competitive all the way. 
"W e’re all like pawns in the game of football. Just look at this, our center of 

H-5 quit tins year but he’s rated high because of his size. Its getting bigger and bigger — like Too Tall Jones 
(Dallas), Look around me and tty*re are people fi-5 and H H — I’m lucky to have gotten what I did. I do have the size for Canadian Football.” 
“ I ’ve talked with Miami —■ they might send me a free agent contract,” said Texas Tech kicker David Mel lot t from Roosevelt. "I don’t have any il­ lusions about the draft. People draft what they need, and they need skilled positions worse than kickers. Hopeful­ ly, I can get my foot in the door and 
Miami could be a start I’m hungry.” 
Could be a very good year for San 
Antonio in the NFL draft? 
Injured 
Dodger returns 

First baseman Don 
Cardoza rejoined the 
Dodgers in El Paso Sa­ turday following a “ pe- cautionary” check on his left eye, which was acci­ dentally' struck in a freak accident prior to 
Friday night’s game with 
Amarillo at V.J. Keefe 
Field. 
Dodger spokesman 
Steve Ford said the check was made to make sure there was “ no inner eye damage.” The prelimin­ ary diagnosis Friday night said it was a 
“ bruised inner eye.” 
Ford said the attending physician said Cardoza had a small scratch on the white part of his left eye, and released him to rejoin the team imme­ diately. 
Cardoza flew to El Pa­ so later in the day and was expected to be in uniform for the opener of the 1o-game road trip 
Saturday night. 
Cardoza, the team’s leading hitter early in the year, suffered the injury when he was struck by a ball he hit during batting practice. The ball hit the plate, bounced up and struck him in the eye. 
Trenton race won by Wally 

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) 
—- Wally Dallenbach squeezed past his team­ mate Gordon Johncock with six laps to go after fighting side by side for 
2o laps, and went on to victory in 
Sunday’s 
$1oo,ooo Trentonian 2oo race for 
Indianapolis cars. 
Johncock dropped back to finish more than eight seconds behind. Mike 
Mosley was second with 
Salt Walther fourth and 
Todd Gibson filth, gorily six of the 17 starters were itill running at the end. 
Dallenbach qualified only seventh at 162.945 miles per hour, and said, 
“ Starting that far back, I didn’t think I had a chance.” But he made a good start, stayed in contention and was right on 
Johneock’s rear wheels when the race was given the green flag after a tow-in for pole position winner Johnny Ruther­ ford, with less than 5o miles to go. 
“ Racing Cordy is sort of like having a four pound bass on the line,” 
Dallenbach said.

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS N EW S

By MIKE BRUTON 
OE THE EXPRESS N EW S STAEE 
KINGSVILLE - That thing in sports called controversy reared its ugly head once again Satur­ day during the finals of the Re­ gion IV Boys Track Meet at Ja- velina Stadium. 

After heavy rains forced the site of the meet to be changed from Corpus 
C h risti’s B uccaneer Stadium to the campus of Texas A&I University, two coaches w ere left a n g rie r than wet hens. 
And it was not because of the down­ pours. 
Churchill Coach Jack Peterson and the C hargers enjoyed a share of the team title with Marshall but their mile relay team will not be running in the state meet. 
After anchorman Rick Neely pulled from fourth place into contention for the trophy, a collision with Bay City’s anchorm an about 2o yards from the finish left the Chargers in third. 
“ We had three lane inspectors there and they reported no flagrant viola­ tio n ,” sa id M eet D ire c to r C huck 
Haynes after Peterson protested. 
Coming down the homestretch, Nee­ ly was neck-and-neck with the Bay City ru n n er and the L am ar Consolidated and P h arr-S a n Juan-A lam o an c h o r­ men were only steps behind. 
The collision occurred in the second lane, where both Neely and the Bay 
City anchorman were running. On im ­ pact, Neely bounced into the first lane, m is sin g a s trid e and allow ing the 
Pharr-San Juan-Alamo runner to slip through for the victory. 
Bay City took second place at 3:2o.7, just one-tenth of a second faster than 
Churchill. 
“ You ought to see the bruise on my a rm ,” said Neely after the race. “ If I’d hit him it would have knocked him the other way (into the third lane).’’ 
“ I ’ve called Bailey M arshall NIL 
A thletic D ire c to r),” P eterson said. 
“ He said he couldn’t look at the films 
(viedotape of the race) and that the decision rested with the th ree-m an com m ittee.” 
And it was that subject, running on the line, that had Kerrville Tivy Coach 
Rick Keese up in arms. 
After Tivy sped to a second-place finish in the AAA 44o-relay with a 43.2, it was disqualified because the curve judge said a Kerrville runner’s foot hit the line on three consecutive strides in the third curve. 
Track title shared 

Continued from Page IS both slightly trailed Austin Travis’ Bobby Brown, who had beaten the Marshall hurdler in the preli­ minaries. 
On that last barrier, Brown tumbled and, as Clay put it, “ T hat’s where the lucky tee shirt and socks came in.” 
The o th er double w inner was C orpus C hristi 
M iller’s Quicksilver sprinter Charlee Pettis, who nabbed the IOO in 9.7 and the 22o in 21.9. Highlands’ 
Ronnie Drisdal finished second in the .century at 
1o.o . 
Houston’s sprint relay, composed of Jam es Talley, 
Eddie Jackson, Leonard Bacon and Joe Morrison, took second behind Lam ar with a 42.4 to qualify for the state meet. 
C hurchill’s Rick Neely battled Corpus Christi 
King’s Cliff Davis down the stretch in the 44o, but 
Davis beat him by a tenth of a second with a 49.2 clocking. 
Mark Andersen of Jay, won the mile run with a 
4:15.2 and broke his own year-old record in the process. But he appeared disappointed with his performance. 
Marshall’s Jam es Headley won the discus with a toss of 168-6 and Lee’s Chuck Stanley took second in 
Jam ie Giles. C C M oody. 154-3; 4 
L a r r y L e v e r m o n n , D e l R io , 
152-6; 5. B illy Holden, B row n s- 

 the high jum p at 6-4. 
A hot 88o race proved too much for Sari Antonio runners Leon Banks of Fox Tech and Joel Hernandez of Lanier. 
Banks ran a 156.1 to take third and Hernandez failed to place after going out fast on the first lap and later tightening up. 
Southw est m a d e a stro n g show ing d e s p ite a third-place finish in the team standings of the AAA 
Division. 
Ken Jenkins blazed to a first in the IOO at 9.8 and possible could have done better. 
“ There were too many false starts,” he said of the three illegal starts, one belonging to him. “ I had to sit in there and wait. It kind of messed me up.” 

Jenkins also anchored Southwest’s winning mile relay, which crossed the line at 3:23.o. Also running on that unit were Je rry Dockum, who finished se­ cond in the 88o at 1:58.4, Ken Cooper, who won the long jum p in F riday’s competition, and Willie M ar­ tin. 
Burney Allen of Houston was the only other San 
Antonian qualifying in the running events for the state m eet, which will be held in Austin on M ay: 
13-14.

N EW V O R K (A P ) - Manager Hilly 
Martin of the New York Yankees, angered by the unexplained absence of newly acquired M ike Torrez, said 
Saturday if it were up to him he would slap the m issing p teller "with the heaviest fine baseball ever saw.” 
Martin was visibly upset by con­ flicting reports that had Torrez either visiting his ailing wife in Montreal or on a fishing trip with his agent. 
“ I ’ll tell you what I ’d do if I were tin' general manager — I ’d say for every day you’re not here it’ll cost you $5,(Hit) 
He’d be on tin1 next plane," Martin said “ lf it s Ins wife, then I have no qualms about his not being here. Hut if it’s his contraet, then I don’t under-, stand it because he’s signed for this year.

Coin flip in SWC 

WACO (A P ) - Should 
Baylor lose to T exas 
Sunday in a scheduled 
Southwest Conference baseball finale, then a coin flip would be needed to determine the third and fourth place teams in th** nost-season tour­ nament beginning M ay 
19 in Austin. 
Texas 
A & M , the regular season c h a m ­ pion, will play the fourth place team, either Baylor or Arkansas. 
Baylor is 14-9 with a rained out game against 
Texas scheduled Sunday. lf the game is not played, it gives Baylor a better winning percentage than 
Arkansas’ 14-1o. 
A Baylor victory would clinch third place. 
A rkan sas defeated 
Baylor two out of three games during the regular season but according to the SWC a coin flip would be needed and the one- on-one confrontations wouldn’t count.

The d a y ’s events, billed as the “ F irst Annual 
Peanut Tennis Classic,” also included an exhibition doubles m atch that featured P resident C a rte r’s brother Billy and the clowning of Bobby Riggs. 
A crowd of about 4,ooo cheered the tennis and antics. 
Trinity splits 

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS N E W S 
EDINBURG — Karl Theis’ steal of home and 
Hector Rodriguez three RBIs highlighted Trinity’s 
7-5 victory over Pan American in the second gam e of a doubleheader Saturday afternoon. 
Pan Am grabbed the opener, 5-1. But the Tigers, thanks to a double shutout effort Friday night, took the series, 3-1, ending the 1977 season at 18-27. Pan 
Am finished the year with a 45-3o mark. 
Theis, performing as a pinch runner in the fifth inning of the nightcap, stole second, third and home. 
That run put TU ahead, 7-3. at that time. 
Rodriguez knocked in two of his runs with a two-run double and got the third when he walked with the bases loaded. 
Sergio Trevino and Ruben Lozano each had a pair of hits in the Trinity victory. Trevino, Kyle Brannon and Paul Phillips each chipped in an RBL 
TU’s Frank Oakes made a big defensive play, enabling, perhaps, the Tigers to win the gam e. Ile went deep into left center to grab a line shot off Wes 
Thomas’ bat in the sixth. 
In the opener. Trinity got just three singles off 
Mondo Reyes (8-8). Lozano, John Kaufman and Jim 
Summersett registered the Tiger hits. Oakes scored the lone run. racing home from second on an error.

Rain pain for BSC 

By CLIFFORD BROYLES 
O f THE EXPRESS N E W S STA ff 

The Big State C onference race got drenched again Saturday, 

The doubleheader between St. M ary’s and Texas 
Lutheran at Fairgrounds Park in Seguin was post­ poned by rain on the final day of the regular season to further muddle the league race. 
The twin bill has been rescheduled for I p.m. 
Sunday. 
However, both coaches. Ray K att of TLO and 
Elm er Kosub of .St, Mary’s, questioned whether the field would be playable unless “ we get a lot of sunshine.” 
Katt said he would m ake a decision at 9 a m. 
Sunday as to whether the doubleheader would be played. 
If it is not, then the picture becomes even messier. 
4 games 
Although the regular season is supposed to be over, St. Mary’s and TLC have four gam es each to be made up because of rainouts and the only other contender. Southwestern, still has five to m ake up. 
The outcome almost certainly has to be finalized this week because the league winner must play Sam 
Houston State to certify the NAIA District 4 cham ­ pion by May 14. 
To co m p licate m a tte rs , both St. M a ry ’s and 
S o u th w este rn s ta r t final e x a m s M onday an d , scheduling makeups will be touch and go. 
St. M a ry ’s can clinch a tie for the crow n by sw eeping TLC S unday. The R a ttl e r s a re 1o-1, 
Southwestern 7-3 and TLC is o-5. 
Twin bill 
Southwestern swept a twin bill from St. E dw ard’s, 
6-5, and 8-3, Saturday. 
“ I really don’t know w hat w e’re going to do, especially if we don't get to play Sunday,” said St. 
M ary's Coach Elm er Kosub. 
Kosub said the conflict with final exam s would force the team to play any gam es before Thursday at night, and even that would take away study tim e from the players. 
Kosub said he had permission to reschedule final exam s for his players depending on approval of individual professors, but said such was practically impossible because of the n u m b e r of p layers it would involve. 

Here are the gam e* which heed to De made uo by the three contending teams in the Big State Conference chase. Only those which will have a bearing on the league race will be played and none have been officially scheduled beyond the St. M a r y 's and TLC twin bill Sunday.

St. Edw ard's and af home agomst Southwestern.

Cup victory 
Snakes, 'Cats duel for throne 

By CLIFFORD BROYLES 
O f THE EXPRESS N EW S STAFF 

Will the third time by be any different? 

The St. Mary’s Rattlers think it w ill. The Southw est T exas 
Bobcats hope it is not. 

SWT has already bombed the 
Rattlers. 9-o, in a pair of non-confer­ ence dual matches. 
They meet a third time next Satur­ day for the NAIA D istrict 4 tennis championship and the winner is as­ sured a spot in the NAIA tourney in 
Kansas City. 
The Rattlers, winner of the Big State 
Conference title, feel the Lone Star 
Conference champion Bobcats have not seen their better half since two-time 
BSC and District 4 singles champion 
Larry Levinson missed both previous matches with an aggravating hamstr­ ing pull. 
Levinson has been hampered by the injury for the past two months and hopes to be at or near full strength for the I p.m. encounter, which will be at either San Marcos or the Lakeway 
World of Tennis near Austin. 
Despite 
Levinsons injury, the 
Rattlers ended a string of 1H straight 
BSC team titles by St. E dw ard’s, nudging the Hilltoppers, 36-34, on their own courts in Austin. 
With Levinson on the injury list the 
Rattlers had to shift their lineup up a notch. With him in there, theroretical- ly at least, they should be a little stronger at each position. 
“ I think our No. I and 2 singles players are as good as they are,” said 
St. Mary’s Coach Steve Nienhaus. “It will make a big difference to have 
Larry in there.” 
Levinson played in the BSC tourna­ ment despite the injury and made the finals. 
“ I feel sure I could have won it had I been healthy,” said Levinson. “ I was restricted in my movement. I had a lot of tape on my leg.” 
In Levinson’s absence, junior college transfer Ben Nixon has taken over as the No. I player. Nixon went undefeat­ ed in BSC dual match play and lost in the tourney sem ifinals to eventual champion Jako Garos of St. Edward’s. 
“ Probably the deciding factor this year has been the fine play of Ben 

Nixon,” said Nienhaus. 
Nixon, a Churchill graduate, played two years of tennis for Amarillo Junior 
College. 
Magee 
David Magee, a junior from Fort 
Worth, plays No. 3 and Tim Jordan of 
St. Louis and Gene Knopik of East St. 
Louis have divided time at No. 4. Jor­ dan is the only senior. 
The d istrict m atch will be a six pointer, which should work to St. 
Mary’s advantage. With just four sin­ gles and two doubles, SWT use its depth as it could in a nine-point match. 
“ It has to help us playing six » points,’’ said Nienhaus. “ Larrv is capable of winning No. I singles and it will also make a big difference for us in No. I doubles.” 
Levinson and Nixon won the BSC doubles championship and will meet 
Lone Star Conference champion Do­ minique Dumillon and Brian Lewis of 
SWT for the District 4 doubles crown in the match. 
Dumillon and Lewis comprise the 
No. 2 doubles team for SWT, but it was the third year in a row that the Bob­ cat’s No. 2 doubles team had won the 
LSC title. 
“ I think they are going to be coming into the match very confident,” said 
Nienhaus. “ We’ve got a chance to sur­ prise them.” 
As far as winning the BSC goes, 
Nienhaus was a former player for the 
Rattlers, starting in 1971. This is his second year as coach. 
“ We should have won a champion­ ship the last few years,” he said. “ We won some tournaments but we never had enough points. There were times we should have won it. We just had the better team this time.” 
1-shot lead 

NAGOYA, Japan (AP) — Hsieh 
Yung-Yo of Taiwan took a one-stroke lead after Saturday’s third round of the 
$2oo,ooo Chunichi Crown International 
Invitational Golf Tournament, shoot­ ing an even-par 7o for a 54-hole total of 
21o. 
The 42-year-old Taiwanese, winner of this year’s Philippine Open, had three birdies and three bogeys on the 
6,728-vard Nagoya Golf Club course in the chase for the $4o,ooo first prize. t

BUENOS AIRES (AP) 
— The United States managed to stay alive in 
Davis Cup tennis compe­ tition Saturday by beat­ ing Argentina in the crucial doubles match of the American Zone final. 
In a two-hour match, 
Americans 
Sherwood 
Stewart and 
Fred 
McNair defeated the Ar­ gentine pair of Elio Al­ varez and Ricardo Cano 
6-3, 6-4, 6-3, reducing Ar­ gentina's lead in the 

 best-of-five series to 2-1. 
The rem aining two singles m atches are scheduled for Sunday. 
Saturday’s win was ex­ pected on both sides since the U.S. team is regarded as having the strongest doubles pair. 
The only surprise was that Argentina did not field its top player, Guil­ lermo Vilas, in the dou­ bles as had been expected. 
But Argentine non­ 

 playing team captain 
Oscar Furlong said he decided at the last min­ ute to replace Vilas with 
Alvarez in order to give 
Vilas a chance to rest for 
Sunday’s match against 
Dick Stockton of Dallas. 
Ricardo Cano, who upset 
Stockton on 
Friday, meets Brian Gottfried of 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in the other singles match. 
Vilas beat Gottfried on 
Friday. 
In the doubles, the 
American pair showed top form from the start, but they appeared more vulnerable when McNair, from Washington, ILC., served. 
His service was broken once by Cano, but the 
Americans in return brok 
Cano’s service twice to comfortably take the first- set. 
In the second set, the 
U.S. players broke Al- verez’s service in the seventh game to take the vital lead and hold on to it until they won the set. 
McNair scored contin­ ually when close to the net in the third set and smashed balls at his op­ ponents’ feet, as the U.S. pair broke Alvarez’s ser­ vice twice for the set win. 

“We knew Argentina had troubles in doubles but I did not think it was going to be that easy,” said Stewart of Houston. 
His teammate McNair said: 
“I’m very happy that we won the vital point for the United States, but this does not mean our troubles are over. We still have to win twice tomorrow to make it.” 
Alvarez, the Argentine player who does not even figure in his country’s national tennis ranking because he lives in Los 
Angeles, said that he felt satisfied despite the defeat.

Soviets skate by U.S. 

VIENNA (AP) - The 
Soviet ice hocfey team easily to an 8-2 victory over the makeshift Unit­ ed States squad Saturday night and took pole pos­ session of the lead in the 
World Championships for the first time. 
Czechoslovakia wiped out Sweden’s perfect record by winning 3-1 in an earlier game. 
That left the Russians with 12 points, Sweden with IO and Czechsolova- kia with nine, all from six games. These three teams will contest the playoffs with Canada. 
The United States, with five National Hockey 
League players plus minor leaguers and col­ lege players, never stood a chance against the highly drilled Russians. 
In the "second period, trailing 8-o, the Amer­ icans suddenly flashed into life with two goals in 
26 seconds. 
First Wally Olds, who lives in Austria, shot into the net with the Russian defense spreadeagled. 
Then David Hynes, of 
Providence in the Amer­ ican Hockey League, scored from 
Bob 
Krieger”s pass.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sundoy May I 1977 
H 

Joe Vito shoots for pot of gold 

The one thing San Antonio has in Spectacular 7 7 is its own Joe 
Vito Buenrostro. 
The name is very familiar in local bowling circles but, this time, the stakes are much higher. 
The best nation’s amateur bowling title is on the line. 
The Spectacular begins its four-day run at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Wonder. 
“ It’s certainly thrilling to bowl in a national tournament before the home­ town fans,” said Joe Vito. “ I ’m defin­ itely going to try and do the best I can.” 
Joe Vito will be bowling against 31 other state amateur champions in the non-pro event. 
“ I know the lanes at Wonder Bowl pretty good and that may give me an edge,” Buenrostro said. “ What can you really say? You win a state title, then regionals, and, then, you get an all-expense trip to the national Specta­ cular — four miles away from home. 
It’s really good I’m bowling here.” 
Buenrostro, of course, won last year’s state Class A all events and had the best score in the western regionals. 
“ I certainly would love to win the tournament before the hometown fans,” Buenrostro said. “ It would de-’ finitely be fantastic.” 
Buenrostro and fellow cohorts, plus the incoming men and women college teams, may be lost in the shuffle of the big pro bowlers. 
Earl Anthony, Mark Roth, Larry 
Laub, Marshall Holman, Carmen Sal- vino. Tommy Hudson, Roy Buckley, 
Patty Costello, Judy Soutar, Betty 
Morris, Cheryl Robinson, Doris Co­ burn, and Vesma Grinfelds will be among the big-name pros who will be vying for the $1o,ooo first-place purse in the $5o,ooo segment of the mixed doubles. Neff and Soutar are the de­ fending champions. 
South Carolina, Houston, Ohio State and Erie Community College of Buf­ falo, N.Y., head a strong cast in the men’s college division. Wichita State, 
San Jose State, Hillsborough Col­ lege, and Erie Community are ex­ pected to be the forerunners in the women’s college division. 
But, after all is said and done, 
Spectacular ’77 could be the script that* 
Joe Vito wrote. 

Around the lanes 

The junior bowlers in the South 
Texas area are uniting in a drive to raise money for the Jerry Lewis Mus­ cular Dystrophy Telethon. 
AJBC bowlers from bantams to 22 years old are soliciting pledges from now until May 14. The goal is $25,5oo. 
General drive chairman is 
Henry 
Hopper of Sports Palace, aided by 
Donna O'Connor and Ann Elley. 
The MDA drive will call for dona­ tions in any amount with the total determined by the number of pins by the junior during league play the day of May 14. 
Participating centers are All Star, 
Astro, Mitchell, Boerne, Bowlerama, 
Del Bio’s Cactus and Bonanza lanes, 
New Braunfels’ Comal Bowl, Goliad,

 defeated Doug Rodwell 6-3, 6-2 for his second consecutive individual title. 
The final point totals had USL with 
45, Lamar with 43, Louisiana Tech with 
29, Arkansas State with 12 and 
McNeese with 7. 
Hernandez, a freshman, used an ag­ gressive net game and hard ground strokes to keep Lamar off pace and 
Griffith, a senior, came with a strong serve. 
USL broke Antle’s serve in the fourth game of the first set. That was the first of five straight service breaks by both teams. Hernandez finally held his serve in the ninth game as Lopez hit a forehand long for USL's 6-3 win.

Crossing produces yellow stripers, a fisheries first 

GRAFORD - Texas Parks and 
Wildlife Department fisheries biolo­ gists now have a new strain of hybrid striped bass that eventually may find its way into East Texas reservoirs. 
Inland fisheries biologists and tech­ nicians at Possum Kingdom Fish Hat­ chery secured two pairs of male yellow and female striped bass and injected them with hormone to induce spawn­ ing. 
The result was an estimated 8oo.o(H) fry of a hybrid that biologists hope will be a good game fish like a striper, big enough to feed on large forage fishes and occupy shallow water areas where yellow bass are most often found. As far as is known, this is a first in the fisheries world. 
“ It’s an experim ent,” said Nick 
( arter. Inland Fisheries Research 
State adding rays to list o f records 

AUSTIN — Stingray fishing is grow ­ ing in popularity along the Texas Gulf 
('oast and to keep pace with the sport 
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officials have added four ray cate­ gories to state fish records. 
Coastal fisheries biologist Ernest 
Simmons of Rockport said four species of rays would be considered for re­ cords — southern stingray, Atlantic stingray or stingaree. cow nose ray and spotted eagle ray. Others would be considered w hen caught and submitted to the department. 
Minimum weights set for the rays are: southern ray, 5o pounds; Atlantic ray, IO pounds; cow nose, 4o pounds; and eagle ray, 2oo pounds. 
Parks and Wildlife officials say identification of rays sometimes is a problem and that each entry should be, documented with a photograph taken from directly above tile ray as it lies on a flat surface. 
The usual entry forms for Texas 
State Fish Records may be used when submitting entries for rays. 
Rays must be taken on rod and reel only, to be considered for inclusion in the saltwater division. Unrestricted division includes the heaviest of the 

 species taken by any legal means 
(archery, spear, gig, handline, trotline, etc.) other than rod and reel exceeding the weight of existing rod and reel records. 
Of the four species of rays, the spotted eagle ray is the largest. Indi­ viduals 7 y-z feet wide and up to 7oo pounds have been caught. 
The Atlantic stingray or stingaree is largely a tropical species, occurring about Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Most records are from shallow, coastal waters, sometimes only a few inches deep. In the Gulf it is found in the shallows during spring and summer and then moves offshore during late fail. Southern stingrays are an inshore species, frequenting shallow, open areas of sand and mud bottoms in search of clams, crabs, shrimp, worms and small fishes. 
The cownose ray superficially re­ sembles the eagle ray without spots. It reaches a width of seven feet and a weight of perhaps IOO pounds. Cownose rays have been taken in waters from 
Brazil to southern New England. It moves across mud and sand flats stirring up food from the bottom with ‘ its pectoral fins. 
Bay yields striper 

PALACIOS — The landing of a striped bass out of Espiritu Santo Bay near Port O’Connor in early April has 
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department coastal fisheries biologists hoping more coastal anglers will report catching stripers in bays along the 
Texas (iu 11' Coast. 
“ We have been stocking stripers in selected bays during the last two years, but this is tile first confirmed catch,” said Bruce llysmith, P&WD biologist. 
More than one-quarter million fin- gerling-sized stripers have been re­ leased in the San Antonio Bay system since 1975, and coastal fisheries biolo­ gists plan to release another 2oo,ooo this year. 
“ The striper is a highly desirable game fish that is native to Texas and was once found in salt as well as fresh water,” Hysmith said. 
Prior to being stocked in the bay, the stripers were reared in a pond at the 

Parks and Wildlife Department facility in 
Palacios. 
They grew to approximately D/2 inches long before being placed in the bay. 
“The recovered fish grew roughly one inch per month since stocked,” said Hysmith. “ It was 13 inches long when caught by Elliot Loy of Hous­ ton.” 
Coastal fisheries biologists plan to stock 3,ooo stripers in Sunset Lake, which flows into Corpus Christi Bay; another 3,ooo in Green Lake off San 
Antonio Bay; 2oo,ooo-plus in the middle of the bay and 1o,ooo in the southern impoundment of Sabine Lake on the upper coast. All stockings will be completed by mid-May, according to 
Hysmith. 
Coastal fishermen catching a striper are urged lo report their catch to the nearest Parks and Wildlife Depart­ ment office or the P&WD’s Austin headquarters, 42oo Smith School Road, 
Austin 78744.

AUSTIN — The flooding Sun Antonio 
River has forced Texas Parks and 
Wildlife Department officials to close all but a small portion of Goliad State 
Historic Park. 
Ron Moreau of the P&WD said re­ servations for group trailer facilities were being cancelled and that only the park headquarters, museum and mis­ sion were open. 
“ Flooding caused considerable da­ mage to roads and picnic areas in the park,” said Moreau. “Traffic on the pavement while the roadbed is still saturated could further harm the roads.” 
Moreau said he expected the park to be re-opened by mid-May, barring any more heavy rains.

 coordinator, “aimed at determining if this hybrid will be a desirable sport fish, especially for anglers who fish along shorelines of reservoirs.” 
Some of the 8oo,ooo larvae hatched in mid-April will remain in the Possum 
“ Kingdom Hatchery until they are IV2 inches long. 
The majority, some 7oo,ooo will be transported to the P&WD’s Heart of the Hills Research Station near In­ gram, where they will be reared for 45 days and then released in experimen­ tal stocking sites. 
On the heels of this spawn, biologists also will attempt to induce a striped/- white bass hybrid female to spawn with a yellow bass male, in their search for a fast-growing, good-an­ gling quality fish.

As the Worm Turns 

TUBE 
W O R M stands on head, wiggles tail 

WOOLLY MATERIAL, shown on hook for use with min­ nows, grips teeth of bass 

I By DAN KLEPPER

After more than 2o years on the market, an angler might think there wouldn’t be much more a fellow could do with the plastic worm. 
But already this year there have been at least two new worm designs, plus the intro­ duction of an “ accessory” for this very effective bass bait. 

Burke Fishing Lures has put a worm called the Hook Worm on the market. 
It looks like a big woolly worm with a curly tail. 
Then there is the Tube Worm by 
Knight M anufacturing Company, which stands on its head and wiggles its many tails. 
And, finally (but no doubt only mo­ mentarily) there is the worm acces­ sory called the Lip Grip by Cotton 
Cordell. 
Tests 

Eve had an opportunity to test only- one of the three items, Burke’s Hook 
Worm. It definitely has its merits. 
The worm body has many protruding plastic spines which act as weed guards if the fisherman wants to leave the hook point exposed. 
An exposed hook point is not parti­ cularly important for the angler who uses a stiff worm rod and is able to set the hook with sufficient force to tree­ top a small bass, but it can be impor­ tant for the user of light tackle, espe­ cially ultralight. 
It is not easy to drive a hook into the mouth of a bass when one is using a limber ultralight stick. Fortunately, the fish sets the hook itself (most of the tim e) when striking artificial lures such as spinners, swimming baits and topwaters. 
Buried 

But if the ultralight angler fishes a worm with the hook point buried in plastic, he will lose fish on the jump simply because he has not been able to forcefully drive the point through the plastic and into the mouth of the fish. 
Being able to fish a worm with the

 hook exposed makes a difference. 
I tried a four-inch Hook Worm along a brushy fence line in a South Texas ranch lake one afternoon last week, using an ultralight quarter-ounce rod and an open-faced reel filled with six- pound line. 
Wire 
I landed three bass, the largest al­ most four pounds, lost two on the jump and had my line broken twice. 
Both breaks occurred when the line raked limbs and rusty wire on the fence. 
The important thing is, out of seven strikes on the worm, five of the fish were firmly hooked with the ultralight equipment. 
Cordell’s Lip Grip is designed to re­ duce the number of fish lost due to thrown lures when the fish jumps. 
The Lip Grip consists of the female side of a material called Velcro. The male side of the m aterial has thou­ sands of tiny fibers shaped like hooks, and when the two are placed together, 

 the m aterial becomes an effective fastener for garments. 
Cordell contends that when strips of the female side of the material are attached to lures or rings of the ma­ terial are slipped over plastic worms, the teeth of largemouth bass become enmeshed in the fibers. 
I’m not sure many anglers are going to take the trouble to strip the stuff, which has an adhesive backing, onto hard plastic lures or slip rings of it around soft worms, but, if the material works, it has a practical application as skirts on spinner baits. I understand 
Cordell will have such skirts on the market soon. 
The Tube is an interesting innova­ tion in plastic worm development. 
Most of the body of the worm is hollow. 
According to the manufacturer, air trapped in the hollow body is released under the water, and the air bubbles make the skirt-like tail flutter. 
The worm is solid at the head, which causes it to stand on end under the surface.

Open honor to Loudermilk 

The San Antonio Golf Association has voted to dedicate the 1977 Texas Open professional golf tournament to the honor of Oak Hills country club professional Hardy Loudermilk. 
L. H. “ Hank” Hudson, president of SAGA and general chairman of the Open, said the resolution was based on Loudermilk's “major and significant contributions and a long and abiding interest and love for the Texas Open.” 
Oldest winter tournament on the PGA tour, the 
48th edition of the Open is scheduled Oct. 12-16 at 
Oak Hills. 
“Through the years there have been many dedi­ cated persons who have worked very hard on the 
Open,” Hudson said, “ but the name of Hardy 
Loudermilk has got to be somewhere near the top of the list.” 
Loudermilk said he and his wife, Norma, have been overwhelmed by the gesture. 
“Our reaction is there are so many other persons far more deserving of this honor than I...people like 
John Monfrey and the other past presidents of the 
Golf Association.” 
Loudermilk, 54, has been professional at Oak Hills for the past 15 years. 
He is credited with having been instrumental in securing $1oo,ooo from the PCA to revive the Open after it had fallen on hard times and was discontin­ ued in 1971. 
Since 1973 Loudermilk has been waging a grim battle against a disease called polyneuritis. It has claimed his left foot and left him to maneuver on crutches and wheel chair. 
He has been fitted with an artificial limb with which he hopes to become better adjusted by the time the Open rolls around next October.

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

“ Playoffs,” John Havlicek said with m asterful understatement, 
“ bring out the best in everybody.” 
If nothing else, it brings out the best in the Boston Celtics. 

The National Basketball Associa­ tion’s defending champions spent this year just sort of hot-and-colding it along, winding up with a fair-to-mid­ dling 44-38 record and not even assur­ ing them selves of a place in the playoffs until the last week or so of the regular season. They finished six games behind the Philadelphia 76ers. 
Ah, but those playoffs ... how they turn on the guys in green. The Celtics, gunning for their 14th title in 21 years, had their backs against the wall Fri­ day night — but they rose to the occa­ sion and whipped Philadelphia 113-1o8, forcing what promises to be a frantic- deciding game Sunday. 
In Sunday’s other quarter-final games. Washington, down 3-2, takes on visiting Houston; Los Angeles invades 
Oakland for a sixth game with Golden 
State trailing 3-2, and Denver, down 
3-1, tries to fend off elimination at the hands of visiting Portland. 
.Jo Jo White scored 4o points, Havli­ cek had 25, Charlie Scott 2o and Dave 
Cowens, avoiding a sixth personal foul for the final 17 minutes, had 19 re­ bounds to pace Boston’s triumph. 
“Dave is the key to our defense and he still operated effectively with all those fouls,” said White. But Cowens replied: “All I did was not get No.6.” 
Still, it was two of Cowens’ plays that decided the gam e. With Boston up 
1o3-1o2, Cowens stole a pass and Scott wound up with a pair of free throws. 
Twenty seconds later White scored on a layup after Cowens blocked a shot. 
And the Celtics were off the wall. 
“ Our situation is obvious,” says 
Washington Coach Dick Motta. “Our backs are to the wall. It’s sudden death now, and we’ll see what kind of char­ acter we have.”

HIO DE JAMERO (AP) - Mascal de Sousza, who played collegiate bas­ ketball in the United States, scored 3o points Friday night in leading Brazil’s 
National team to an 84-77 victory over the University of Arcansas and the championship of an international tournament. 
De Sousza, who played at Bradley 
University, led Brazil’s 1o-point burst in the final seven minutes to clinch the victory. 
Argentina, which defeated Arkansas 
77-75 Thursday night, finished second in the tourney, and the Razorbaeks finished third. 
7 
Sidney Moncrief led Arkansas with 
24 points while Hon Brewer, who hit nine of 12 shots from the field, added 
2o, and Marvin Delph tallied 16. 
De Sousza’s goal broke a 59all tie with about IO minutes remaining, then 
Adilson Nascimento scored four points to send the Brazilians on to victory. 
Arkansas made 6o per cent of its shots from the field, but was called for 
28 personal fouls compared to 17 for 
Brazil. Brazil converted 16 free throws and the U.S. team made nine.

Chase Hill address built near university 

The first complete apartm ent community next to the UTSA campus, Chase Hill, will be in the spotlight this weekend. 
The community is serenely secluded in the actual Texas Hill Country, which, by itself, yields a num ber of d esirab le extras like scenic views from patios or balconies, peace­ ful atmosphere, country quiet and, certainly not the least, refreshing, cooling breezes. 
Advantages 
But there are only the advantages of Ch^se 
Hill’s rustic setting, since the community, its apartments and strategic location reveal how this project was able to im prove on what already was there. 
Chase Hill is just a pleasant walk from the 
UTSA campus. The project, then, is ideally located for students or staffers at the univer- 
Sunflower suits most 

* everyone 

The Sunflower A part­ m ents get w inning re ­ marks from its residents. 
Answers to “ What do you like best about The 
Sunflower?” range from w asher - dryer connec­ tions to a light - hearted 
“ the project’s proximity to Last National Bank.” 
The Sunflower is located at 2554 N .E . Loop 41o between Starcrest Drive and the Old Austin High­ way (U.S. Hwy. 81). 
The home laundry con­ nections is just one of the a p a rtm e n ts’ featu res that come in for praise. 
Many, according to the popular opinion, appre­ ciate m ost their attractive kitchens with top-of-the-line ap ­ pliances. Still others like best the individually controlled air condition­ ing and heating and the fact that all utility bills are paid. 
Everyone also had good words for the decorating schemes: the rich, warm colors of carpets, cabin­ ets and countertops and the unusual wallpapers. 
Floor plan s at The 
Sunflower include one - bedroom plus study, two 
- bedroom / two - bath and three - bedroom un­ its. 
The project is divided into adu lt and fam ily section s, each with its own sw im m ing pool. 
T h ere’ s also a p lay ­ ground and a 
Teen 
Room , a s well as a beautiful clubhouse that includes a kitchen, wet bar, pool table, TV room and a conversation area. 
To see The Sunflower 
A partm en ts and fu r­ nished models, exit N.W. 
Loop 41o at S ta rcre st 
Drive and take the east - bound service road. 

 sity. 
Bearing that in mind, the community offers the kind of apartm ents and amenities which best suit the lifestyles for them. 
Chase Hill features all that it takes for study, fun and relaxation. It has been planned to offer this to its residents along with the most desirable item — comfort. 
Ranging from the efficiency unit to the large two - bedroom, two - bath plan, Chase 
Hill Apartments are arranged in ways which meet the needs of its residents — and then some. 
Exam ples of how the apartm ents more than meet their needs can be seen in the ample closet space, either walk - in or wall - to - wall with slide - guide doors; built - in desks common to all plans; facing vanities which allow a compartmented bath to function as 

CHASE HILL APARTMENTS ideal for 

I hi baths; and storage clo sets off either fenced patios or railed balconies. 
Two recreational areas on the apartment grounds are offered to coincide with the ar­ rangement of the apartment groupings. Each features a large swimming pool with poolside furniture, laundry facilities and recreational and relaxing areas, table tennis included. 
Besides its unequalled convenience to UT­ 
SA, Chase Hill has good proxim ity to the clubs and restaurants in the vicinity. As well, 
USAA and the South Texas Medical Center, along with other medical facilities nearby, are accessible via N. W. IH IO. 
Leasing arrangem ents which match the 

 university students, staff university’s calenday of sem esters are of­ fered. A lease arrangement for 12 months or more grants the final month free of rent. 
Rental ra te s begin reaso n ab le. 
All apartm enta showing this weekend are fur­ nished; however, they may be leased as un­ furnished. G arages and mini - storage also may be leased. 
Chase Hill Apartments can be reached by exiting from N.W. Ill IO to N.W. FM 16o4, proceeding west to Chase Hill Drive across from a major entrance to the cam pus, then driving north to the apartm ents and the leas­ ing office. The exact address is 158o1 Chase 
Hill Dr. Signs lead the way.

Don’t worry if you can’t see it from here. That’s what makes it nice living at Chase Hill. 

I’m surrounded by acres of open hill country. Miles o f cedar and oak. And oceans of quiet. I jog in it. Hike in it. And bike all around it. 

When I want to be by myself. 

When I want to be surrounded by smiles and bikinis, however, I just hang around one of Chase Hill’s pools. With all the other people who want things like dishwashers and disposals and shag carpeting. 
Just as long as Loopworld’s noise and rush-hour traffic don’t come with them. 

Don’t get me wrong, though. 
We’re not exactly at the ends of the earth around here. U TSA ’s only a five minute walk away. And of course, my job at the Medical 
Center’s right nearby, too. 

That gives me a chance to rise and shine a little later in the morning. Which is great. I may live in the country. But there are some city habits I’ll never give up.

“ home” in more ways than one, with plenty of storage space, roomy closets, a wide var­ iety of floor plans to choose from, with bright contemporary designs and colors to add zest to daily living. 
C onvenience is a keynote in an E llison apartm ent. A ll-electric kitchens m ake the living easier after a hard day at the office by the working man or woman.

So much comes with an apartm ent at 39o3 B ar­ rington, in fact, that 
Marymont is the only area which b efits its many offerings. 
39o3 Barrington, one of the more imaginatively planned apartment com­ munities in northeastern

This is because of the extrem ely reaso n ab le rates at the comprehen­ sive project. In fact, not until 39o3 Barrington be­ gan leasing were such rates known to the espe­ cially presitgious area of 
Marymont. 

N um erous fa c ilitie s are Available to residents at 39o3 Barrington, just as if they all were in their very own back yards. Even that parti­ cular phrase in no way exaggerates on the cer­ tainty of privacy resi­ dents at 39o3 Barrington enjoy daily.

The family section has a sw im m in g pool, basketball court, tennis court and fenced play­ ground. The adults’ sec­ tion has a sw im m ing pool, two tennis courts, recreation room, volley­ ball court and saunas. 
All this, though, is but a partial list of what is for the residents’ exclusive enjoyment at no extra costs whatsoever. 

The amenities are ar­ ranged conveniently and attractively throughout the p roject’s prem ises totaling some 27 acres.

SA A A Director of Education 

In this co un try's dem a n d in g co nsum er-orien ted society, rental industry success depends now m ore than ever upon p ro f­ essional pro perty m a n a g e m e n t perform ance. Both laws and renter sentim ent will eve n tu ally require certified com ­ petence in a p a rtm e n t m a n a g e m e n t. Few universities are equipped, staffed or inclined to provide the education requisite 

 to this certification. A p a rtm e n t associations m ust assum e this responsibility. A n y association th a t is not providing top notch 

 educational program s is not ad e q ua te ly serving its m em bers or its industry. 

Education is S A A A's num ber one lon g -ran g e priority. Its Certified Apartm ent M a na gem ent program is co m ­ 

 prehensive an d of gen uine va lu e . S A A A ,is not m erely a diplom a mill. Its CAM program is recognized an d endorsed by 

H U D . 

Beginning in 1 9 7 7 H U D will require certification of all resident m anagers of H U D -re la te d properties. It is possible th a t 

 som eday certification m a y be required o f all resident m anagers of all m ulti fa m ily rental properties. 

CAM is on e reason the San A n to n io A p t. Assoc, is one o f the nation's m ost highly regarded ap a rtm e nt associations o p e ra t­ 

 ing to d a y . Ed uc atio n , legislation, resideht relations, professional guidance and counseling have been o n g o in g , practical 

 benefits o f m em bership since the o rg a n iza tio n ’s beginn ing in 1963. M em bers — active leaders and successful businessm en 

 and w om en — do n ot accept com raderie as their only return from association m em bership; th e y dem and (and g et) m uc h, 

 m uch m ore . 

CAM is the new est — and perhaps the greatest — of the benefits th e y ’ve dem anded. 

This special article outlines the program for yo u . 

You are in vite d to review CAM carefully and call the office for answers to any questions yo u m ay h ave. 
W hat is CAM? 

The Certified Apartm ent M a n a g e r program is an educational program defined by National A p a rtm e n t Associa­ 

 tion President Don Law rence as "th e o n ly m eans by which the a p artm en t industry is going to be able to heigh ten the 

 distinction b etw een a p a rtm e n t m anagers and professional ap a rtm e n t m anagers. The refore, it becom es in cu m be nt upon us, 

 the entire in d u stry, to support this outstand ing pro gram , as an im porta nt facet to assist in assuring success an d not failure in 

 an a lrea d y e xp e n se -b u rd e n e d in d u s try.'' 

CAM is a service to the a p a rtm e n t ow ne r as it helps him train and groom his m angers in a very professional an d com ­ 

 prehensive w a y . The need fo r w ell-tra in e d m anagers has n ever been greater. CAM gives the ow ne r w ho is in terview in g new 

 people an exact picture of w ha t the applicant has been exposed to if he has com pleted all or part o f the sem inars. 

CAM is a service to the resident as he will be assured o f living in an ap artm ent w ith professional m a n a g e m e n t. The resi­ 

 d en t seldom rents the a p a rtm e n t. He really rents because o f his impression of the m an ager. This is the q u a lity o f person 

 tha t the resident w ould like to have in charge of his c o m m u n ity. 

CAM is a service to the m an ager as it offers him a tang ible goal through certification. We all do better w he n we have a 

 goal to strive for in self im p ro ve m e n t. A diplom a has little intrinsic va lue, but the achievem en t that it represents is in ­ 

 va lua ble. So w ith CAM ; w e all need incentives to help urge us to excellence. 

CAM is a service to our industry as it will im prove the im age of m ulti fam ily housing in the entire n a tio n . How m a n y 

 owners h ave been gu ilty o f placing the responsibilityof a m u lti-th o u sa n d dollar a p artm en t building in the hands o f a couple 

 w hose on ly need was fo r co m p lim entary shelter? How can the ow ner possibly expect professional results from un train ed 

 people? A p a rtm e n t m a n a g e m e n t is no longer a career for the a m a te u r. The very best public relations program as ow ner

Diversified projects 

 offered by ‘Life’ firm 

Life Investors has three distinctively dif­ ferent projects to present apartment hunters this weekend, and each offers a distinctively different life style. 
La Paloma Apartments, 1o2 VV. Rampart St. in central northern San Antonio; Terrace 
Apartments, 9525 Lorene St., also in central northern San Antonio; and The Pier Apart­ ments, 1946 N. EL Loop 41o in northeastern 
San Antonio are the highlighted apartment communities. 
‘Waterscaped’ 
The Pier features an unusual Japanese garden setting, even “waterscaped,’ and an especially friendly atm osphere. Ponds, streams, weeping willows and even ducks comprise the striking setting for The Pier, which appeals mainly to singles and profes­ sionals in their 2os. 
An Olympic size pool, party pavilion with fire pit, sundeck and cabana make up just some of the fun of living at The Pier. Adja­ cent to the property are volleyball and tennis courts. 
Apartm ent features here include ap­ pliances to match color schemes, accent

 walls, dens with fireplaces in some, beamed cathedral ceilings, continous clean ovens, self 
- defrost refrigerators, washer - dryer con­ nections, wet bars and penthouse levels. 
Convenience and comfort create a colorful atmosphere of easy living and relaxation at the Terrace Apartments. Available either furnished or unfurnished, the Terrace offers spacious floor plans in attractive designs of one, two or three bedrooms. 
Completely coordinated, fully equipped kitchens meet all demands for color and easy living inside the Terrace apartment homes. 
Easy living and relaxation also is assured by two large swimming pools and two private party rooms featuring fireplaces, bars and sun bathing decks. 
Convenience is offered in the forms of pri­ vate carports for all Terrace residents and complete laundry facilities on the apartment grounds. 
La Paloma, which translates from Spanish as “ the dove,” is aptly named because peace and quiet are wonderfully enhanced by its 
Spanish architecture. Blooming shrubbery, immaculate grounds, flower beds, courtyards and, of course, an atmosphere of serenity and seclusion are major parts of La Paloma, 

 oriented to adule life styles. 
This project also is one of very few where a four - bedroom floor plan can be found. La 
Paloma does in no way exaggerate, then, when it calls its units apartment homes. 
Other plans at La Paloma include three different sizes of one - bedroom apartments, four different two - bedroom plans, townhouse 

- styles and three - bedroom plan with large living area and two baths. 

Life Investors is famous for its life styles so diversified among its projects. The firm invites apartment hunters to visit each this weekend and promises a unique “ exper­ ience” for each visitor.

Units at Round Tree come with ‘Parcourse’ 

A big attraction at 
Round Tree Apartments, 
11444 Vance Jackson Rd., is the first European 
“ Parcourse” in the city. 
The Parcourse is a 
Swiss idea. If s like a playground for adults in that it is a physical fit­ ness course based on a jogging and walking cir­ cuit. At various stations along the way, signs de­ scribe a specific light exercise and recommend par as the number of reptitions to try at var­ ious fitness levels. The 
Parcourse allows young and old, even the entire family, to exercise to­ gether — all at their own paces. 
Other extras 
Although Round Tree offers the only Parcourse in town, the feature is popular in Zurich and other Swiss towns; San 
Francisco, 
Portland, 
Honolulu and San Diego. 
Many of the Round Tree residents indeed enjoy the opportunity of walk­ ing, jogging and doing easy exercises for a mile or two. 
Other extras at Round 
Tree include tennis courts, swimming pool, volleyball courts, frisbee round nine and the Great 
Outdoors. 
A real extra is the beautiful wooded envir­ onment 
Round 
Tree 

 owners have preserved. 
Another extra is that 
Round Tree is close to the medical center, just a few minutes from the 
UTSA campus and less than 2o from downtown. 
Round Tree offers a variety of comfortable one-, two- and three-be­ droom apartments and townhouses with a selec­ tion of seven floor plans. 
All living and dining 

 areas are open and spacious. Other comforts include plush carpeting, large closets, dish­ washers, private patios and balconies and con­ venient laundry faci­ lities. Special sections for families and adults are another attraction, along with the excellent schools and nearby shopping ar­ eas.

 luxury of country living and the convenience of being close to nature without leaving the city and does offer something extra.

More trees along the walkways lead to the green tennis courts, lighted at nights. This is one of the ways La Plaza has become the net set’s favorite. The complex even offers tennis lessons taught by a professional, and tournaments are scheduled regularly. 
The grand clubhouse presents another way in which La Plaza is ideal for those who enjoy li­ festyles full of social events and getting to know their neighborhood. 
The La Plaza club­ house is the project’s site for many scheduled acti­ vities. Some of the events sponsored by residents themselves include char­ tered bus trips they take together. 
The clubhouse, of course, is more than just a meeting place. It offers a party room, complete with kitchen facilities, that overlooks the Olym- pic-size swimming pool. 
A carpeted, relaxing conversation area is fea­ tured, too. 
The lower level also is where “ exercise” is the key word. The fully equipped exercise room, boasting full carpeting, wall mirrors and only the latest in weight-lifting equipment, is for men and women residents at different hours. 
Separate bath facilities for them adjoin the exer­ cise room, with sauna and whirlpool baths for their exclusive use. 
“ Recreation” also is a key word. Upstairs is a game room featuring pool tables and ping-pong as only some of the amusements at La Plaza. 
‘ Relaxation” enters the scene, too, with the balcony overlooking the outdoor amenities.

Managing to care about you is all that it says. 
Gill Cos. has managed multi-family com­ munities for more than 3o years in San An­ tonio. 
Personal pride 
The firm ’s management services result in better maintenance, professional on-site staff and a way of living that points to personal pride reflecting home-style living. 
That always has been the Gill Cos. goal. 
The firm invites all to visit any of its apart­ ment communities: 
El Madrid — Located in near northwesterm 
San Antonio at 6111 Vance .Jackson Rd., this project offers gracious, spacious all-adult apartment living with ideal floor plans, con­ venient apartment amenities and security in 

 a location sought by many. Outstanding fea­ tures include fireplaces in most units, decor­ ator wall coverings, w asher-dryer connec­ tions, all-electric kitchens by GE with dis­ posers and frost-free refrigerators in all units two-bedroom in size or larger. 
Sundance — Located in the Turtle Creek 
Valley, this recent project nears completion as an all-adult apartment community with an amenity package that includes a tennis court and game rooms — normally never seen in an adult-oriented complex. 
Continental — A partm ents here feature beautifully landscaped courtyards that boast privacy fencing. Shopping is at Fredericks­ burg Road and N.W. IH IO, despite the pro­ ject’s air of quiet seclusion. 
Moonpoint — Another project in the Turtle 
Creek vicinity, Moonpoint boasts proximity to 

GILL COS. presents M oonpoint Apartm ents aV one of six projects 

USAA, UTSA and South Texas M edical 
Center. 
Woodhill — Right off N.W. IH IO at Huebner

Texas Hill Country’s “ foothills.” 

South Seas — Located at 7543 South Sea 
Lane, this project emphasizes leisurely living with a superb location near the intersection of 
Blanco and 
Jackson-K eller 
Roads. 
Management here is necessarily professional and fantastic.

By RON WHITE 
NEW YORK — Paul Newman sits back in a posh restaurant in Central 
Park. Blue eyes gleaming and feeling relaxed and cool amid the polished silver and crystal, he leans forward, elbows on the table and sips a can of 
Coors. 
Newman appears supremely content, as well he might. One of the few sure box-office attrac­ tions, Newman has settled into a career that’s been both successful and steady. 
Perhaps it s his age, perhaps the jading effect of too much success, but whatever the cause there s a vein of discontent behind those baby blue eyes. 
“Tragically, I’m bound to this profession,” 
Newman says after a pull at his beer. “ It's hard at 52 to change, but I may do that. I’m looking around.” 
Why tragically? 
“ Well, because I'd like to do something else,” he says. “ And I find that I ’m sim ply not equipped to go back to school now.” 

Newman finds life in 
‘Slap Shot’ 

THAT DOESN’T KEEP him from trying to change his life. Newman is interested in energy developm ents and m arine farm ing, and has experiments in both going on. 
But he is bound to a career as an actor, w hich, despite his success, is filled with self-doubts. 
“ I sometimes feel like a study in middle-age desperation. I’m getting to the point where I’m repeating myself, and ifs not a very comforta­ ble feeling." 
Newman sips his beer. 
“ I look at my work and I see little scraps of characters I’ve played in the past jumping from one character to another. 
“ I seem to bt1 able to crawl out my skins only so many times. It comes as a disappointment, but there’s nothing you can do about it. 
“Guinness and Olivier have an inexhaustable supply of characters. They’re always original. I don’t know how they do it. Terrific.” 
Newman even doubts his im portance as a movie star — not only his own importance but that of most so-called stars. 
“ I don't think anybody guarantees box office anym ore, with the possible exception of 
Streisand. Not Redford. Not McQueen. Not 
Brando. Not me. 
“ People are more whimsical. They have a sh o rter attention span. They d on’t extend loyalties like they used to — not the loyalty to stars.” 
‘The film demonstrates very effectively what the American mentality is.’ 

NEWMAN DOESN’T EVEN believe lie s the star of his latest movie, “.Slap Shot,” a wildly obscene and v iolent comedy about a wildly obs­ cene and violent sport — hockey. 
“ I'm not the star of this movie,” Newman says. “The film is its own star. It doesn’t make any difference who the actors are. The energy, the personality of the picture — that’s the real star. 
“ I approve of that." 
A representative of Universal Pictures comes up with a cold six-pack to replish Newman’s now empty beer can. Newman pauses to rip a fuji can out of the six-pack and pulls the tab open. 
Reporters seated nearby look on in a mild sort of awe. 
How does he manage to drink so much beer and remain slim, one of the writers asks. 
“ I have a m etabolism that burns it up ,” 
Newman says. “ I don’t know. It s not exercise. I was imm obilized once for six months and I didn’t put on weight. 
“ I’m just perverse. Absolutely perverse.” 
He drains off a good portion of the beer and gets back to “ Slap Shot.” 
In the film Newman plays the aging coach of a pro hockey team that’s being folded after a long losing streak. Newman turns the team into w inners — in the game and as crow d pleasers — when he plays up the gam e’s violence, turning each game into funny, slapstick free-for-all. 
Directed by George Roy Hill, who also dir­ ected “The Sting" and “ Butch Cassidy and the 
Sundance Kid," which both .starred Newman, 
“ Slap Shot" at times hints at being a comic 

Dickey Betts: 

From the Allm ans’ ashes 
Zam ora & friends 

Oscar Zamora says being South Tex­ a s’ most famous M exican-Ameriean entertainer and media personality will probably drive him crazy in the end. 
The man has to live an around-the-clock schedule and juggles se­ veral personalities as he gives life to his puppets and an array of radio characters almost daily. 
But if madness sets in, 
Zamora says it won t be all that bad since at least h e ’s had the chance to m ake thousands of peo­ ple laugh. 
In m ost 
S p a n is h ­ speaking homes, Zamora is known as the weather­ man on Channel 41 and the one person who can keep a fiesty dumm y by the name of Don Cherna under control. 
The v e n tr ilo q u is t’s h our-long 
“ Sal y 
P i m i e n t a ’’ television show has m a d e him a household word with the n a tio n 's L atin p o p u la ­ tion. The show is aired in 
New Y ork, M iam i and 
Los Angeles as well as 
San Antonio. 
During the show s five year run. the Bagle Pass native has esta b lish e d him self as the n atio n ’s leading S p a n ish -sp e a k ­ ing ventriloquist through his weekly appearances on the locally produced program. 
The dapperly-dressed p erform er has gone far beyond the basic trick of paralyzing his lips and m aking it look like the dummy is talking. 
B esid es Don Cherna, 
Z am o ra often ha n d le s another puppet known as 
T o rrid io s i m u l ta n ­ e o u s ^ ith Don Cherna. 
This is no easy trick since 
Torridio has a 
Puerto Rican personality 
. . . accent and all. 
W hen h a n d lin g a rap id -fire conversation between the two puppets isn’t challenging enough, 
Zamora and Don Cherna will sin g at the sa m e tim e. At least it looks that way. 
But performing on the vaudeville-style variety show is n ’t enough for 
Zamora. On weekends he totes Don Cherna to the 
Beef and 
Bourbon 
Lounge, at 1551 Bandera 
Road, where he stages a night-club act. 
The 1o:3o p.m. perfor­ mance is just part of Za­ m o r a ’s day — which u su ally b eg in s aro u n d 
5:3o a m. 
Until recently that was tim e he w ent down to 
Radio KUKA to prepare for his m o rn in g “ R an ­ cho” program where he c re a te d s e v e ra l c h a r ­ ac te rs by using his a r ­ senal of v oices. 
After the program, Za­ m ora spent most of his tim e o rg a n iz in g his newest project, a locally made mov ie. Then it was 
5:3o p.m. and time to step into his weatherman role. 
R ecently he drop ped his radio show to devote m ost of his day to the film. 
So betw een rac in g to c o m p le te the m ovie w ithin six w eeks, p ro ­ d u cin g a v ariety show and r e p o r tin g the weather, Zamora says he som etim es has cause to wonder about the type of life he leads. 
“ You know the mental hospital on South Presa f 

Street? When i t s all over 
I'll p rob ab ly end up e ith e r th ere or d e a d ,” says the 42-year-old en­ tertainer. 
Though Zamora laughs when he say s th a t, there’s a hint of resolve in his voice — getting to be a household word has exacted its price. 
“ My wife and four children stay in Acuna 
(M e x ico ), b ecau se there's no way to fit our schedules together. 
“ It used to be she would be asleep when I left in the morning and s h e ’d be asleep by the time I got home at night. 
That's no way to live, so now I go to see them in 
Acuna as often as possi­ ble.” he explains. 
Zam ora explains that w h ile his c a re e r , fashionable clothes and lu x u ry c a r m ay m ake him se e m la r g e r than life, all men are equal in the eyes of a bill collec­ tor. 
“ Sure I have a fancy car, but just like every­ body else I owe on it. 

This is a very difficult m a rk e t to m ak e any money in.” 
Bul as Z am o ra d e ­ scribes the realities of making ends meet in the 
Spanish-language media, there’s an unmistakeable air of assuredness about him. 

For exam ple h e’s po­ sitive his movie will be a major improvement over other locally made films and becom e ste p p in g stone for o th e r film s about Mexican-Ameriean life. 

“ In the b eg in n in g I wanted the first film to be a co n tro v ersial one about the way Mexican- 
Americans discrim inate against each other. 
“ But I decided to play it safe for the first one and make it a combination romantic-action movie,” he explains. 
And while the soft-spo­ ken e n tertain er is opti­ mistic about the movie, despite it’s thin budget, he a d m its it could all flop. 

If it does, Zamora says, it will probably be time for him to pick up Don 
Cherna and Torridio and leave San Antonio for a city with a larger Latin population. 

“ I can always go with my p u p p e ts to som e place like New York or 
Los Angeles and get a job in a night club and make a good deal of m oney,” he says. But then adds he doesn’t want to leave San 
Antonio. R e g a rd le ss of the future, it appears Za­ m ora will be w here he can h e a r an a u d ie n c e laugh — the sound of people chuckling at his co m m en ts see m s to be the balm that soothes the entertainer's soul. 

He e x p la in s: 
“ T he thing is, giv ing people a good laugh eases the rest of my tro u b les. It just seems I get a lot of satis­ faction when 
I h e ar laughter." 

I t s obv iously enough satisfaction to keep him going.

E v ery y e a r in this co un try th ere a re so­ mething like 2.5 million guitars sold. Many of those who buy them learn how to play them. 
An aco u stic g u ita r makes a very nice deco­ rative touch leaning in the corner of the living room by the p h ilo d en ­ dron. Guitars also come with hand straps so they can be walked from time to time. 
C ontrary to popular belief, an electric guitar is not just one of those things with a plug. The in strum en t w hit Ii has become the backbone of contemporary music is much more than just a way to m ak e s trin g plucking louder. 

WITHOUT GOING IN­ 
TO A IX)T of technical stuff that I don’t under­ stand either, the most im p o rta n t d ifferen ce s between the electric gui­ tar and the old acoustic guitar is that when a note is stru ck on an electric guitar, that is just the beginning. 
Where things go from th e re d e p e n d s on whether you are talking about the average guitar owner, the average rock m u s ic ia n , or 
D ickey 
Betts. W herever Betts takes the music, it would be worth your while to follow. 
For years it seemed like Belts wasn’t getting the credit he deserved for the enormous success of the Allman Brothers 
Band. 
But after all. he didn’t even know C her that well. He was also a gen­ uine weirdo. Instead of tearing off his clothes, he just stood there and played good music. 
“ D ickey 
B etts and 
Great Southern” (Aris­ ta) is the second band to rise out of the ashes that 
Grog Allman m ade of the A llm an 
B ro th e rs 
Band. The first group of ex- Allmans to form was 
Sea Level, which took some pretensions to jazz with them. 
Belts took just about everything else.

 sician to get the “ Cali­ fornia 
B lu e s ” this month. 
But when he g ets them, they get got. And 
“ Out to Get Me” opens the album with enough 
S o u th ern h a rm o n ic a tones to freak out Ste­ phen Foster. 
“ Sweet V irg in ia” is low-key b allad with gently sobbing g u ita r to u ch es a ro u n d the edges. “ The Way Love 
Goes” and “ Out to Get 
M e” a re also slowed- down guitar ditties with harmonizing vocals. 
B etts has found a n ­ other guitar player, Dan 
Toler, to battle him on second lead guitar. Toler and some of the other musicians played with a 
Macon, Ga., band called 
Melting Pot. 
T oler calls h im self 
“ D angerous” Dan. He c a n ’t en d a n g e r Betts, but he may be a threat to a lot of other people in the business who call th e m se lv e s g u ita r players. 
Talking with a group of high school students recently, I referred to 
Sea Level as the Allman 
Brothers without the bad g uy. S om ebody said , 
“ Yeh, but also without 

 the good guy — Dickey 
Betts.” It is about time 
Betts was getting that kind of recognition. 
The Amazing Rhythm 
Aces have almost com­ pletely blown th e ir cover. They burst on to the scene with a country sin g le called 
“ T hird 
Rate Romance,” which fooled everybody into giving them awards as a promising new country band. Their new album 
“ Toucan Can Do It Too” 
(ABC) is about as country as an electric grit. 
The Amazing Rhythm 
Aces are: (A) Amazing; 
(B) A honky-tonk rock blues band; (C) Sophis­ ticated m usicians who once backed the fluid folk of Jesse Winchester; and (D) All of the above. 

PER H A PS 
THERE 
REALLY IS another band with a country re­ putation that would dare to record and anti war song. But an anti-Civil 
War song? 
T h a t’s “ Last L etter 
Home” with lines like “ I would turn away if I would not fall” and “ I cannot sleep for wonder­ ing why’s a rebel’s cause so right.” 
“ Everybody’s Talked 
Too 
M u c h ,” 
“ J u s t 
Between You and Me and The Wall, You’re a 
Fool” and “ I’m Setting 
You F re e ” are mostly bluesy rock with a lot of low, sweet guitar. 
There is also a song called “ Two ('an Do It 
T im).” I didn’t make a mistake before. The title of the album is “ Tou­ can.” 
Maybe that is the bird that they are giving to everyone who dismissed them as country. 

I CAN'T THINK OF 
ANYTHING more bor­ ing than c o m p a rin g 
Betts’ new hand to the 
Allman Band, so I won’t do it. The fact is Dickey 
Betts and Great South­ ern sounds a lot like the best of Dickey Betts. 
A song like “ Run, 
Gypsy, Run” is rock that rolls smooth and fast. 
“ B o u g a in v ille a ” is bluesy and soulful with runs around the guitar that tell more than any of the lyrics could. 

On Hie records.

UNUSUAL THINGS TO OO A BUY IN SAN ANTONIO AND OUR AUCA. 
The Great American 
M ahler’s Third unleashes his joy 

When the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra performs Mahler's Third Symphony this com­ ing Saturday night and the following Monday, it will be venturing into some heavy musical seas. 
The third is one of Mahler's most diverse compositions — some of it overwhelming in its orchestral dynamics and other parts so subtle and beautiful it is almost enough to make a listener weep. 
Whether the San Antonio aggregation under the direction of visiting conductor Francois 
Huybrechts can pull it off will be interesting to see. 
One group that lias pulled it off — and quite admirably — is the Chicago Symphony under the direction of James Levine (HCA lied Seal 
ARUM 757). 
This is a delicious recording of a dazzling work. Mahler wrote the third in 1895 and 1896. 
It was originally to have seven parts, but was finally cut back to six. 
Originally, Mahler had given each of the movements titles like “ Pan Awakens” and 
“ What the Rocky Hills Tell Me” (first move­ ment) and “ What the Trees Tell Me” (second movement) and “ What the Twilight Tells Me 
(third movement) and “ What the Night Tells 
Me” (fourth movement) and “ What the Morn­ ing Bells Tell Mc” (fifth movement) and 
“ What Love Tells Me” (the sixth movement). 
The Symphony itself was to carry a title like 
“ A Summer Midday Dream” but Mahler dropped all the programmatic^! titles on grounds his works were more impressionistic than his contemporaries who were into pro­ grams in a big way. 
Still, the titles fit well and as the orchestra begins unraveling the majesty of this joyful 
Mahler glimpse of life one can hear snatches of 
Strauss’ “ Also Sprach Zarathustra" and Ber­ lioz’ “ Symphonie Fantastique” sprinkled in among the Mahlerian passages. 
Particularly dazzling is the third movement with its distant trumpets echoing through the pastoral stillness. The score is a bit confused here since it calls for a posthorn in B-Flat — an instrument unavailable to the composer. 
The Chicago opted for a trumpet in C played from the back balcony and blown toward the ceiling. 
It will be interesting to see what San Antonio does with this. 
Also very beautiful is “ What the Morning 
Bells Tell Me” (fifth movement) with its choral and boys choir parts imitating the ringing of the bells. 
The Third is not the result of one of Mahler’s manic-depressive periods (as was the second) and the joy is most contagious. 
If you want to become familiar with the music before you hear it at the symphony, this very artistic reading by Levine and company is a fine choice. 
That also goes if you want to hear the Mahler again after the symphony performances Sa­ turday and Monday. The more you listen, the more you’ll like it.

Apple Pie Contest 

Last year Try It! tracked down San 
Antonio’s best cheese cake. This year we're looking for the restaur­ ant that serves the best slice of that all-American favorite — apple pie. 

Our ever-hungry staff got an attack of patriotism (and the munchies) and vowed they would leave no crust unturned to search out the tastiest example of Johnny 
Appleseed’s favorite pie. 

The rules are simple. The pie must be made by the restaurant entering it (no frozen, commerical pies permitted). Any variation on the basic apple pie is permitted 
(Dutch crumb, apple chiffon, what­ 

 ever). A whole pie must be deli­ vered to the Express-News Sunday 
Department anytime between 9 a.m. and I p.rn Monday through 
Friday. Pies will be judged by several expert eaters on the basis of taste, consistency, and originali­ ty. Contest ends May 31. 
The winner of the Great Ameri­ 

 can Apple Pie Contest will be announced, along with a photo­ graph of the winning pie and its chef, in a later edition of the 
Express and News. 
Come on. Let’s show some old­ fashioned sense of American com­ petition. Get those apple pies a- cookin’.

Hi 

Trail rides through the 
Cascade Valley of Banff 
National Park in th Can­ adian Rockies will be conducted this year from 
July 4-Oet.l. 
Veteran guides leading the expeditions are Hon 
W arner and 
“ M ac” 
MacKenzie. 
There art* the two base camps, one in the se­ cluded, heavily wooded area cif Stoney Creek, and the other in a lovely open meadow in Flints 
Park. 
Private trips are also available. 
They are designed for a family or group of friends interested in rid­ ing through wilderness areas, camping at dif­ ferent locations, with a competent guide to lead 

 the way, tend the horses, and generally set' to the comfort of the guests. 
A capable cook will prepare the meals. 
W arner and 
M ac­ 
Kenzie supply all the es­ sentials apart from per­ sonal belongings. On confirmation of a ride, a detailed list of personal necessities to take along will be supplied. 
Fishing rods and ca­ meras are a must. 
Trout, rainbow, cutthroat and eastern brook, swarm in the mountain streams. 
Anglers must obtain a 
National Parks fishing license and carry it with them. 
Wildlife shots can be' spectacular — — the lakes, streams and al­ 

 pine meadows, all set in majestic mountains arid captured on film will be cherished for a lifetime. 
Ron and “ Mac” sug­ gest that riders who are beginners or a little rus­ ty should go for a few 

 short, warm-up rides at their ltx*al stable, to "get the kinks out” .

Making the most of the photo process 

Inflation is killing photography! 
Silver costs have out-distanced NASA and there is no hope of it topping out in the forseeable future. 
The same model Nikon body that cost $25o in 71 now sells for over $5oo. As .Japanese labor demands Western wages, c a m e ra prices redouble. 
Black and white printing paper used lo^eljLfor about five cents a sheet in the late Ohs. if now costs twenty centena sheet for 8 x IO in large quantities. .' 
Photographic chemicals have never bean cheap because most bf them have no use outside of photography. But, as miners’ and refiners’ wages go up, so does the cost of photographic chemistry. 
The Express — News used lo sell 8 x IO reprints of staff photos for $2.5o. That was as recent as 18 months ago. Now, paper and chemicals cost almost that much not considering the time 45 minutes or more for the photographer to make the print. 
A reader asked for a.set pf prints from a recent assignment. 
When I quoted her the going price of $4.5<)-per-prinl, she asked for the negative because she knew someone who would make the prints for $1.5o each. 

I’D U K K TO KNOW who is doing 8 x ll) black and white prints for $1.5o. I want to get my bids in early for his equipment. You can pick up some real bargains in bankruptcy settlements. 
To survive in photography, saving money and cutting corners is imperative. 
I ve been doing it for years and I ’ll pass a few ideas along. 
As always these suggestions are without warranty or guarantee. lf you want absolute dependability, go by the book or get a sketch pad. Photography is only an exact science when the formulas, techniques and instruments are followed exactly. 
Like buying food, photo supplies are usually cheaper in large economy sizes. 
Ektaprint 3 chemistry costs about $15 for the one gallon size but only about $25 for 3 Mi gallon size. Pricing gets better as quantities go up. At 25 gallons, the per-prinl cost is down right cheap. 
Bulk film is the only way to go. 
A I OO-foot roll of film will load 18 reusable cassettes and only costs about one third the price of factory loaded disposable rolls. 

B IT TH ER E ARE four drawbacks to loading your own film. If you are not matieulously clean, you will scratch the film in the process. Frame numbering is confusing to say the least — some rolls will start with the first frame on number 22, or such, and go through 44 and end on two or three. 
If you send your film off lo be processed, occasionally the lab may run your film through the wrong chemicals, not knowing what is in the cassettes and finally, commercial processors do not return the reusable cassettes. That adds about 5o cents to the cost of each roll. 
Still, bulk film and rull-your-own is a big saving on one of the most expensive photographic supplies. 
There is little savings in buying photographic paper in bulk unless you can buy long rolls and cut it to the size you need. This is impractical for most people with home darkrooms. 
But if you have a large freezer with an unused corner, you might consider buying paper as a hedge against inflation. 

AT CLOSE TO ZERO, photographic paper just doesn’t age. 
Take out a hundred sheets at a time and keep the hulk frozen. It is not going to get any cheaper and it’s more comfortable printing on paper from yesterday’s market than tomorrow’s silver. 
( heck out your kitchen for goodies that will work in the dark­ room. Rubbermaid dishpans make great fixer trays and print washers. They are a lot less expensive than those sold for photo­ graphic use. 
Rosin coated paper dries just as well on a plastic coated record rack as on the type made inst for drying paper. A discarded 
Volkswagen wiper blade will work as a terrific darkroom squeegy. 

PHOTO TIPS by Ron Jones 

They are soft, easy to handle, lake little space , , and free is a hard price to beat. 
Get to know someone at a camera store that handles used equipment. It is possible to get stung on used cameras and lenses. 
But if you know who you are buying from and the shop has a reputation for standing behind what they sell,.used equipment can be a real bargain. 
The last three cameras and seven lenses I acquired have been used. I ve saved over two years mortgage payments oh my wife s car by buying used instead of new equipment. 

(JETTING THE MOST out of the processing dollar is where the tricky part begins. 
. 
•- 
• 
Buy liquid chemicals. 
; 
' 
, J 
They usually cost more but they are easier to stretch. , 
You will need sump simple laboratory glassware: Two UHM) ml beakers; two IOO nil graduates; and two 25 ml (5o ml will do) graduates. These are available from Edmund Scientific. 
Before you start, mark one of each “ (lev.” and the other “ fix.” 
Use the .glassware marked "dev.’.’ only for developer and measure everything else with the one marked “ fix.” 
C’LEAN IN ESS is not only recommended it is an ABSOLUTE necessity. After each use rinse (he mixingequipment at least three times and again at least once before each use. Dry the beakers and graduates with a dean paper towel before measuring a chemical. Make this a darkroom dogma.. 

FOR W HATEVER SIZE chemicals you buy. measure the fluid contents as precisely as possible. If the quantity is to make one gallon of working solution, divide the contents by four for quarts or eight for pints. 
If you buy the really big sizes, 25 or 51) gallon (or if you use the chemicals very slowly) get a bottle of compressed nitrogen to flush out the air in diestock solution. Some of the big photogra­ phic supply houses sucpas Porter's carries small cans of nitrogen for this purpose. 
Black and white developer can be stretched by developing two rolls of film on one reel' Load the film on the reel back to back so that the EMULSION is facing OUT on both sides. This allows twice as much film lo bo developed in one shot developers such as 
D-7H one to one. 
After the film is out of the fix re-wind it on separate reels to wash. 
Iv e had some success with this iii color chemistry, using a piece of monofilament fishing line to separate the two rolls of film. But 
I can’t recommend it until I ’ve worked out the details, If anyone has tried this, I would like to hear about your experiences. 
Fixer can bt* used until there is still some cloudiness to film after three minutes. This is about twice the recommended use for proper fixing but do you really want prints and negatives to outlive you? Most of them will just be clutter in IO years and after all, times are hard. 
Everybody knows about using a tropical fish aquarium heater for hot water baths. Fifteen dollars beats a hundred every time. 
Color print developer can be stretched by replenishing with 25 per cent fresh and adding la per cent to the normal time. 
John Shipley tells me he is using a basket line for color prints that has never had the chemicals changed. Talk about squeezing the most out of the great yellow father. 
★ ★★ 
Clip the following for use in your darkroom. The quantities given are for one pint of working solution if you want to work with half pints div ided by two. For quarts, multiply by two. 
Always start with water at the proper temperature as suggested in Kodak’s mixing instructions and follow directions just as though you were mixing the full kit. 
Always mix chemicals in the order they will be used. This lessens the chance of chemical contamination. 
Always wash and dry the measuring vessels after each chemical. 
When mixing chemicals that have more than one part — such a* color developers — make sure each solution is completely mixed before adding part “ B ” or “ CV’ 
Be neat.

PAUL NEWMAN at ease 
Slap 
Shot 
J. 
From Page I 

 diatribe agianst the overly macho violence of sports. 
But at preview screenings some of the most violent portions of the film — scenes of-players clobbering each other with their slicks along with bloody brawls on the ice — had deceived enthusiastic applause and cheers for Neuman's team. 
Is ii possible “ Slap Shot’’ has become an example of what it purports to satirize’N 
Newman doesn t think so. 
“ The film demonstrates very, very effectively what the American mentality is. I see the pic­ ture as a very dark comedy. It s a satire that makes its point without using a sledge hammer. 
“ If you look at motion pictures, thev^simply reflect society. Society was here before pic­ tures. There’s a line in ‘W ESA ’ (a Newman picture): You, the real beasts may not b£ in the arena.” He sips his beer as he talks, fj 
' Dresden, Hiroshima, Vietnam, Congress, 
Watergate — they all anesthetize society. Peo­ ple only see pictures that break through their anesthesia. We’re in such a passive |jid un­ creative time, something like this movie comes as a breath of fresh air.” 

BUT THE AIR in “ Slap Shot” is often blue with the thick, locker-room language of the hockey players. Was anyone offended by it? 
“ Yes,” Newman admits, “ a lot of people were offended by the language. But I have a toilet kind of mind anyway. I don’t think anything’s vulgar if its truely funny. 
"What I think would be truly offensive is if we showed these guys in the locker room and they were sav ing, Gee, vvillikers gosh. Did you see that darn fall?” ’ 
At one point in the film, when Newman dis­ covers his team will be folded as a tax loss despite its winning streak, he suggests to the female owner of the team, in quite specific language, that her son indulges in activities that are frowned on in polite society. . 
“ You really find out where the audience is in that scene,” he says. “ At first they applaud politely and then they cheer as I walk out the door.” 
For Newman, tile biggest problem vviih “ Slap 
Shot wasn’t the violence or the language. It was learning to skate well enough to look cre­ dible as a hockey player. 
Before filming began, Newman spent two months practicing with a group of semi-pro hockey players, wearing a bustle lo protect his rear end from frequent falls. 
"I iiadn I skated for about 35 years,” be said. 
“ But I was OK until about two weeks into the picture. Then we had to fight on the ice ^or six hours and I caught everything from my navel to my knees. It slowed me down a bit. 
“ Next I think I ’d like to do a film about a bridge player, where ail I have to do is sit down. 
Or maybe about a massage parlor. Just lie there and let ‘em massage. 
“ Yes, sir,” he says, finishing his beer, “ I ’d just like to take it easy.”

M augham and 5-cant philosophers 

By LESLIE HANSCOM 
The books of Somerset 
M augham used to be marked on the binding with a symbol that all readers old enough are likely to remember. It was a 
Moorish sign against the evil eye: a thing like a gothic arch, with spikes on the out­ side and a cross with a double bar within. 
Just as appropriately, 
Maugham might have marked his books with a dollar sign, because to a large extent, that was the kind of writer he was. 
Maugham was every­ body’s idea of the writer as success in the world. 
The young who aspired to authorship as a ticket to the good life patterned their fantasies on his well known career. 
Ile was famous for his travels in Pukka sahib style to faraway places where he collected ma­ terial for stories which made him even richer. lie was lord of an estate on the Mediterranean to which kings were pleased to be invited. He lived so long — 92 years 
— and em bodied so much sophistication that the world trod a path to his door to draw upon his accumulated wisdom. 
Good life? 
This indeed ought to have been the good life — but was it? True to the w arning of every five cent philosopher who ever preached that suc- 

SOMERSET M A U G H A M 
. . .model for good fife 

 cess is no way to be happv, it was not. In SO­ 
M ERSET MAUGHAM 
AND 
HIS 
WORLD 
(Scribner’s; $8.95), a new addition to an illustrated series that has included biographies of Kipling and P roust, F red eric 
Raphael records a per­ sonal history and a per­ sonality that even a hungry writer might he­ sitate to swap for his own. 
Fate endowed Maugh­ am with talent (although critics d isag ree about how much), but it also loaded him with afflic­ 

 tions. 
The first and m ost warping to his develop­ ment as a man was a se­ vere stammer. Raphael recounts an incident from his childhood which tells it all in one brief vignette. 
The young 
Maugham was in Lon­ don’s Victoria Station, trying to buy a ticket to the home of the austere clergyman uncle who had taken him in as an or­ phan. Unable to get out the name of his destina­ tion, he was driven back to the end of a long queue by unsympathetic fellow 
Gerson9s effort ct sinking premise 

By RICHARD 
ERICKSON 

Noel B. Gerson is a poor man’s Arthur Hai­ ley and he demonstrates his second place finish excellently in his newest book, 
LINER 
(Doubleday; $8.95). 
In 323 pages, Gerson tries to do for luxury ocean liners what Hailey did for hotels, airports, the auto industry and banks. It’s a sinking premise. 
It fails because Ger­ son, famous for his fic­ tional biographies on such historical c h a r­ acters as Teddy Roose­ velt and Sam Houston, doesn’t really convince the reader that the auth­ or knows the inside story as Hailey does so well. 
Certainly research was done for the book, that is not denied, but it seems to be the type handed out by the steamship firm in dated press releases. 
David Bowen, ace cap­ tain of a large liner be­ longing to the Columbia 
Lines, wants the job of ruling the waves on the supership U.S.S. Colum­ bia. 
But that am bition is thw arted when the company gives the top job to a naval war hero and tells Bowen he is se­ cond in command. What this really m eans is 
Bowen controls the ship and the old war hero gets all the credit. 
And that, along with a 

 few rom antic sidelines and a h u rrican e that sparks the predictable clim ax of the book, is about the whole story. 
It’s fast reading and, if you have a choice 

 between LINER and a two-month-old magazine on your next trip, the book would be the choice. 
But only if you had seen the m agazine before.

 travelers annoyed by the delay. 
The other life-long challenge to Maugham’s nervous adjustment was his homosexuality. Far removed by his birth in 
1874 from the m odern 
Gay Libbers who broad­ cast their abnormality as a political cause, he was a product of Victorian convention who couldn’t accept himself for what he was. 
V ictoria’s grandson. 
George V, once remarked of hom osexuals, 
“ I thought men like that shot them selves,” and 
Maugham, in his heart felt the sam e way. He experimented with m ar­ riage to a British socia­ lite and allowed . the marriage to be wrecked by his attachment to an 
American good-for-noth­ ing who passed as his 

 m ale secretary, but to the end of his life a dozen y ears ago, he lived in fear that his private life would be exposed and condemned. 
Maugham hated the wife whom he wronged, and he is supposed to have sung at news of her death, “ Tra-la-la, no more alim ony.” In his old age, he carried on a running quarrel with the d aughter of that m a r­ riage. His brother who became Lord Chancellor, 
B ritain ’s highest legal officer, he regarded as 
“ the most odious man I have ever met.” 
Coming of age in the heyday of Oscar Wilde, when social reputations could be built on the knack of turning a cruel epigram, he had a bitchy tongue when he could get it around the stammer. 
Except for sporadic gen­ erosities, he was not a nice man, and to his own discomfort, he knew it. 

M augham ’s bio­ grapher suggests that the

 greater part of Ins work 
' ‘could be read as an ex­ ercise in revenge.” His most admired novel, the autobiographical “ Of 
Human Bondage,” set­ tled an old score with an early love w ho made him miserable. 
He portrayed this indi­ vidual as Mildred, the vulgar, g rasp in g w ai­ tress who is the hero’s m is tre s s although the real-life model may have been a Cockney m ale prostitute. 
In 
“ Cakes and A le,” the other novel on which his critical reputation main­ ly rests, he lampooned 
Hugh Walpole, the nove­ list who was one of his 

 chief rivals as a popular entertainer. 
R ap h ael's skillfully compressed narrative is as Vivid as the book’s pictorial matter, and he is sane on the .subject of 
M a u g ha rn ’s sh o rtco m ­ ings as a writer, which he d o esn ’t try to explain away. 
The best summing-up of Maugham’s career in letters, however, was m ade by Anthony Bur­ gess in reviewing this book when it cam e out some weeks ago in Eng­ land. “ It was, and still is, easy to speak of his limi­ tations,” Burgess wrote, 
“ but no man told a yarn better.”

Grandm other Debbie K. 
On Broadway 

NEW YORK - “ Yes, 
I ’m a grandmother,’* confessed Deborah Kerr, not looking it, but liking it. 
While having tea at the 
Regency bar a recent af­ ternoon, “ because I'm terribly English still,’’ the beautifully elegant 
Miss Kerr gave details. 
Her grandson, Joe 
Shrapnel, by her daughter Francesca. 25, is 5 months old. She had thought grandparent- hood might be a burden. 
“ I didn’t think it could be as magical as it is.” 
Rushing from L.A. where she’d played 
O’Neill’s “ Long Day’s 
Journey Into Night,” to do Shaw’s “ Candida” in 
London, she remains one of the busiest and best actresses. 
And now as a grand­ mother she can look back on the days w hen she was considered daring and erotic without disrobing. 
“ Things can be excit-

 mg without everybody immediately taking their clothes off,” she said, and remembered two sexy milestones in her own career. 
In 
“ Tea and 
Sympathy” on the 
Broadway stage with 
John Kerr, Deborah Kerr went into the room the boy occupied and said, 
“ Years from now when you talk about this — and you will — and then, 
“ she started to undo the top button of her blouse. 
The lights went down in the theater. That was much more effective than taking off all her clothes would have been.” 

In “ From Here to 
Eternity,” around the same year, 1953, “ I took

 a roll on the beach with 
Burt Lancaster. Nobody had seen two people en­ joying each other so completely, and so obli­ vious of the water. That made it erotic — but it was never in bad taste.” 
Deborah the grand­ mother pointed out primly that they wore swimsuits when swim­ ming 2o years ago. Now, sex, pornogoraphy and violence have been “ done to death” and she’s of­ fered some “ rubbish” she wouldn’t think of do­ ing. 
In fact, although she’s 

 been nominated six times for Best Actress 
Oscars and won Best Ac­ tress from N.Y. Critics four times, 
Deborah 
Kerr admits being con­ fused as to sex rights and what filmmakers should do about them 

“ The women have gone too far,” she said 
“ A poor man doesn’t know what to do. Is he supposed to make the first move now, or if he does, will he get clobbered? 

“ I like it the way it was. My husband doesn’t like it if I hail down the cab. That’s supposed to be his function. He’s supposed to be the boss.” 

Her husband. Peter 

Viertel, the novelist and screenwriter, and she are residents of 
Switzerland. “ I skiied when the kids grew up. 
They said, “ If Mummy can do it, we can,’ and pretty soon they whizzed right by Mummy and left her behind.” 

Miss Kerr might be back on stage in N Y. in 
“ Candida” — following the London engagement. 
She's so traveled she has a story for every place. 

She remembers Sa­ muel Goldwyn introduc­ ing a distinguished mili­ tary visitor as “ Marshall 
Field.” Sam quickly apologized, 
“ I don’t mean Marshall Field, I mean Field Marshal,” he said.

Minnie Pearl writes her story 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - 
It’s an era of book-writ­ ing, so why not Minnie 
Pearl? 
The glamor girl of 
Grinder’s Switch is going to tell the story of her life in print. 
Simon & Schuster, a 
New York publishing firm, has asked her to put together enough ma­ terial for a minimum 
2o,OOO-word hard cover tome for release in 1978. 
" It ’s going to be one of those ‘as told to’ books,”

 who in is Mrs. said Minnie, married bliss 
Henry Cannon. 
The 63-year-old Grand 
Ole Opry comedienne adds: " It ’s going to be a happy book. It’s going to be about country comedy as I ve seen it —- and humor in general.” 
Minnie said it will be

REALLY HERE! 

WILLIAM SHAINER’Sr 

PAGE 14 
EXPRESS-NEWS SUNDAY MAGAZINE— May 1.1977 

 the first ‘‘real” book about Minnie Pearl, the person and the enter­ tainer. It’ll include pho­ tographs of Minnie, her relatives and her friends. 
‘‘I have already about 
17 hours of my recollections on tape,” she explained. 
‘‘The m anuscript,” 
Minnie emphasized, “ will be ac­ tually written by Joan 
Dew of Hollywood. She has written quite a few articles — some about country music per­ formers — for ‘Red 
Book’ ‘Coronet,’ and other slick-papered ma­ gazines.” 
Members of the Cin­ cinnati Reds are wearing cowboy hats purchased at Jimmy Gateley’s wes­ tern store here. 
(You remember Gately? He was featured on Bill An­ derson’s Po’ Boys show for years and is now working as a solo act). 
It all started when a friend of Johnny Bench bought a hat ($8) and sent it to him during spring training. Bench began wearing it with his uniform and it caught on with some other players who ordered sim ilar ten-gallon hats. 
" I have no report on the club’s front office reaction about the fad,” said Gatelev. “ I'm sure the players don’t wear them during games. It probably is against the rules, and anyway,” he laughed, "the protective helmet that all batters 

 wear wouldn’t fit over the cowboy hats.” 
Gately reported 
— commercially — that bu­ siness at his western clothing store was OK. 
“ However,” he hedged with a grin, “ it may be because we give a free cup of coffee to every­ body who enters the store 
— whether he or she buys or not.” 
Stan Kenton, (65), ve­ teran big band leader, who admits publicly he 
"abhors country music,” was here for a concert and “ almost” attended the Grand Ole Opry. 
“ I had a notion to go to the Opry House and watch some of those pickers and singers per­ form,” Kenton said, “ but decided against it. I didn’t know if they would let me in. And if I got in and was discovered they might pitch me out on my backside — and I ’m getting too far along in years to stand those bumps any more.” 
Jazzman Kenton, who too long ago called country music “ an abso­ lute national disgrace,” agrees country music is more popular with the general public than jazz, bended slightly in some of his remarks: “ I still feel the same about country music in gener­ al,” he said, “ but there are some ‘country’ artist 
I like. 
" I dig the work of Chet 
Atkins, Boots Randolph, 
Floyd Cramer and a few more around here. How­ ever, I ’m not sure they are real ‘country’ at this stage of their careers. 
All play pop, rock and jazz.” 

Evangelist Bob Har­ rington, who recently signed with a local talent agent for bookings on entertainment shows, is going to do some of those shows with comedian 
Jerry Clower. “ Our per­ formances are going to be so clean,” said Har­ rington, "we could be booked into churches.” 

Clower, who frequently talks to religion-oriented audiences, says: “ We’ll probably have the only comedy act where even the word ‘darn’ isn’t used.” 

Mickey Gilley, Barbi 
Benton, Johnny P a y ­ check, Ariehie Campbell, 
Johnny Russell and the 
Hart 
Fam ily gospel group have featured roles in theatrical movie, 
“ The Adventures of J.D. and the Salt Flat Kid,” now being filmed in this area. 

M INNIE PEARL 

Described as a “ co­ medy with country mu­ sic,” the story centers on a group that sets out to appear on the Grand Ole 
Opry. How they succeed 
— at the fadeout — is unbelieveable. 
You’ll have to see it. 

After shooting is com­ pleted here, production will shift to MGM’s stu­ dios in Hollywood. It is scheduled for release in the late summer or earlv fall. 
A reader in Indiana wants to know what ever happened to singer 
Peggy Little, who was a regular on the Loretta 
Lynn show and did quite a bit of recording work? . 
. . Frankly, my Hoosier friend, nobody in Music 
City USA knows exactly 

 where Peggy — a tiny lady w ith a big voice — is these days. However, one of my sources said he saw her a year or so ago working in a truck stop. 
CB radios currently appear to be the “ in” item for people to steal. 
CAV. (Convoy) McCall, commenting on the con­ stant pilferage, said: “ A rare motorist is one whose CB hasn't been stolen.” 
(And that’s not a 1o-4 situation).

HE’S # I IN TK JINGLES 

HIT PARADE 

STEVE Karmen writes the songs you hear the most — commercial jingles. His hits include “ When you say Bud you’ve said it all,” and “ You can take Salem out of the country but you can’t take the country out of Salem.” 
Karmen said he tries to put across a single strong message in each jingle. Usually the key line is provided by an advertising agency. “ Here we are interrupt­ ing this guy watching Charlie’s 
Angels.” said Karmen, who lives in New York. 

“ We want to keep his attention, not say one thing and then anoth­ er until he turns it off.” 

Karmen refuses to do jingles for detergents, acne remedies or hemorrhoid cures because he doesn’t feel anything musical can be sung about them. 

And, despite offers from the 
1972 Nixon and 1976 Ford cam­ paigns, he won t take political jobs. 
“ You could make Adolf Hitler look great with the right advertis­ ing campaign and the right mu­ sic,” he said. “ I owe my children more than that.”

THE STAR CONTINUES YOUR SUPERFITNESS PLAN FOR SUMMER 

RELAXATION EXERCISES: DAYS 7-18 

*YOU can get fit this summer by Just getting in the right mood — with a re­ laxing new mind-power technique. 
The program is outlined by Dr. C. 
Norman Shealey in his new book, OO 
Days To Seif Health (The Dial Press 
$7.95). Dr. Shealey, director of the 
Pain 
Rehabilitation 
Center 
In 
La 
Crosse Wise., says fitness can be achieved through a series of mental exercises to ease tension and stress. 

By Dr. C. NORMAN SHEALEY 
EMOTIONS and moods vary tremendously. They are affected by heredity and especially by the home environment. But chemical in­ fluences, especially diet, light, physical exercise, and habits, all strongly influence emotions. 
While you’re still working on those habits, consider the following self­ tests. Ask yourself these questions: 
Do I get irritable, annoyed, angry, or depressed when — L I feel as if 
I’m being attacked unfairly? 2. I don’t have adequate sleep? 3. I’m under any stress? 
4. I’m surrounded by people? 
5. I’m out of the limelight? 
6. I lose, even in a simple game? 
7. I’m around other disturbed persons? 
8. I have to compromise on my desires? 
9. I’m held up by someone being late? 
1o. I’m by myself? 
11. I have to watch my temper? 
12. I have to get up in the morning? 
13. I’m not perfectly dressed? 
14. I can’t have that quick drink in the evening (or earlier)? 
15. The weather is bad? 
16. There’s a lot of noise? 
17. I can’t smoke? 
18. Someone else smokes near me? 
19. I drive? 
2o. I have any crisis in life? 
21. I have to meet new people? 
22. I’m criticized? 
23. I have to go to a social function? 
24. I have to go to a doctor or dentist? 
25. I make an error? 

[MOTIONS ARI 
A VITAL KEY TO 
BETTER 
HEALTH 

If you answer yes to more than 
8 of the questions, you need to bal­ ance your own emotions more ef­ fectively; if you answer yes to more than 15 of them, you’re in real trouble emotionally. 
Slow down. Take a look at where you’ve been and where you're going. Spend a few minutes thinking about and writing your answers to these questions: 
. What are your goals? 
What is worthwhile in life? 
What problems deserve your at­ tention or concern? 
According to Dr. Meyer Fried­ man and Dr. R. H. Rosenman, au­ thors of Type A Behavior And 
Your Heart, people who are com­ pulsive “workaholics” — Type A personality, they la­ bel it — are very prone to develop coronary artery dis­ ease or to have heart attacks. Type A peo­ ple have an intense sense of ur­ gency. They do everything with great haste but never find enough time to do ail the things that are planned. 
Similarly, they are always im­ patient with the snail’s pace at which everyone else is working. 
Others talk too slowly, work too slowly, and even play too slowly for Type A’s. For them, waiting in line is particularly stressful. 
Despite all this intensity and

 speed, the Type A person never has any time to do those things that are really fun and really count in life. 
The following is a test you may use to determine which of the two personality types you are. Ob­ viously, there are other criteria, also. 
How do you decide if you’re a 
Type A or Type B person? Try these for size: 
1. I’m always busy, even if it’s just wiggling or doodling. 
2. I smoke. 
3. I often feel ill when I have a deadline. 

4. I chew my fingernails. 
5. New people make me nerv­ ous. 
6. I hate pokey drivers. 
7. I get very irritable if I have to wait. 
8. I’m always in a hurry. 
9. I can hear my heart beating and it often skips a beat. 
1o. I gulp my meals. 
11. I have trouble going to sleep. 
12. I have to chew gum or something else. 
13. I have to take a drink or a sleeping pill at night. 

14. I lose my temper easily. 
15. I need a drink to relax. 
16. I am apt to be nauseated, dizzy, or faint or have cramps when I’m stressed. 
17. I fiddle with my hair, scratch a lot, or pick my nose. 
18. I get upset easily. 
19. I don’t like to watch other people talk. 
2o. Noises irritate me a lot. 
21. I prefer active sports. 

22. I have to talk a lot when I’m around other people. 
.23. I worry a lot. 
24. I’m impatient with others. 
25. I can’t sit still; I have to have something to do. 
If you have over 14 “yes” an­ swers you lean toward Type A, and if you have 2o to 25 yes an­ swers, start right away to learn to slow down. 
Remember, the type B person­ ality lives longer.

AUTOMOBILE accidents are costing Americans almost $4o bil­ lion a year, a new government study shows. 
The study, prepared bv the Na­ tional Highway Traffic Safety Ad­ ministration. reveals that $16 bil­ lion is lost every year in wreck victims' present and future earn­ ings and services. 
An additional $1 billion is spent on medical and rehabilitative costs and property damage totals 
$11.4 billion annually, the report says. 
“Medical treatment resulting from injuries and fatalities con­ sumes medical resources that could be shifted, in the long run. to preventing and curing dis­ eases," the report says. 
Although the cost of pain and suffering is recognized by courts and covered in some no-fault in­ surance plans, it was not included in the study. A cash value was al­ so not placed on the loss of life. 
Nor were “a number of qualita­ tive losses to both individuals and 
.society that defy measurement," the report says. 
These include losses in conjugal affection, grief to others and loss of personal relationships. 
“These losses are real and should be part of any analysis of the effects of accident reduction in qualitative terms.” the study says. “ However, no attempt was made to place a monetary value on these losses." 
“ We used many diferent sources in this study, such as hos­ pital and court records and insur­ ance company claim records,” said Mahisn Podar, an economist for NHTSA’s program planning office. 
Other losses, he explained come in court and legal fees, accident investigations and insurance ad­ ministration. 
“ The resources consumed in these activities could be shifted to raise the existing level of econom­ ic and social welfare of society were they not devoted to cleaning up the damage from accidents, the report concluded. 
Electric eels are seen as future energy source 

ELECTRIC eels may someday swim to the rescue of energy defi­ cient America. 
In recent experiments conduct­ ed by students of the University of 
British Columbia in Vancouver, the electric current of several eels was stored up and used to power a string of lights on a con­ tinuous basis. 
Experimenters found that most of the time, the eels emit 1.4 volts of electric power which they use as a navigational aid in swim­ ming. 
But when disturbed, the little creatures can generate as much as 6oo volts. 
Officials do not recommend buying eels for energy just yet, though. 
“The difficulties would be enor­ mous." one said. "Besides, the eels might not like it."

IN 1975, Dr. Richard Raskind, a respect­ ed eye surgeon, underwent a sex ge operation to make him a woman. 
Now, as Dr. Renee Richards, she is demand­ ing that the tennis world recognize her as a female and allow her to participate in top women’s tournaments. 
By MICHAEL MOK 

MY INTERVIEW with Dr. Renee Richards was alm ost over before it started. Spotting her com ing through a crowd at the Port 
Washington Tennis Academy on New York's 
Long Island, I blurted out; “Excuse me, sir, would you please . . . " 
Renee froze in her tracks. “ If you want to talk to me at all. you'd better not call me ‘SIR'," she snapped. 
With that, Dr. Richards turned her broad back 
(she has shoulders like a coal heaver) and stalked off where I couldn’t follow — into the locker room marked LADIES. 
Somewhat dismayed, I found the practice court where she was to work out and was glad I did. To understand her. you’ve got to watch her in action. 
Dr. Richards has tremendous poise and self-con­ fidence on the court. When she gets set to slam, her eyes are leveled on her opponent. 
The steady, pitiless glance makes you think of the leader of an armored column, looking out of the vision slot of a tank. 
She is left-handed, and hits with smooth power. 
Dr. Richards, who stands 6 ft 2, has lost about 4o pounds since the sex change operation, but still has extraordinary strength, with muscles more like those of a speed swimmer than a tennis player. 
Just before the session ended. 
Renee sent several scorching serves across the net with such power that her grinning coach made no attempt to return them. 
Leaving the court in good humor, she agreed to meet me in the players’ lounge. 
By this time, I noticed that the other athletes, female and male, totally accept her as a woman. 
There is no awkwardness about calling her ‘Renee’ or ‘Miss Rich­ ards’, nor any scandal when she troops into the women’s side of the lockers — or takes her own sweet time coming out. 
All of her gestures off-court are extremely feminine. 
The way she shakes hands, put­ ting her huge paw delicately in yours; the automatic way she smooths her dress sitting down, and the different way she accepts a glass of fruit juice, all make you forget you are chatting with someone slightly more muscular than the village blacksmith. 
Lowering her eyes, which are accented with blue eye-shadow, 
Dr. Richards said quietly that she personally doesn’t need proof of her femaleness. 
“As long as I can remember, I have felt female, as if there were a girl trapped inside my man's body, struggling desperately to get out." 
Now that the sex-change opera­ tion is behind her, I asked wheth-

 er she found being female all that she had hoped it would be. 
“I am in a unique position to comment on what it’s like on both sides of the fence," she said, 
“because I’ve lived both as a man and as a woman. 
Living as a fe­ male, I have been treated with 

 the gentility and kindness that our society accords to a woman I don’t just mean having men light cigarettes or open doors for me — although I ve come to enjoy those attentions too — but having people smile at me more. 
“As a woman, people seem to trust you more, and offer their trust right away. It’s as if in deal­ ing with a woman, people are not so afraid of being hurt or disap­ pointed." 
But being a man has advan­ tages, too, she admitted. 
“A man is accorded more re­ spect, and finds it easier to as­ sume authority and responsibility 
— although other men seem to treat him with suspicion in the beginning. 
“ Lots of women think. ‘It’s a man s world,’ and go through life with a chip on the shoulder," said 
Renee, shrugging her own very broad ones. 
“I think that’s nonsense. 
A woman of merit commands re­ spect from men and women alike, and denying that is just sour grapes. 
“ I enjoy being a woman. In­ stead of being an authority figure, 
SHE’S REFUSING TO TAKE ANOTHER SEX TEST 

DR RENEE RICHARDS refuses to take a second sex test to prove to U.S. tennis officials that she is a woman. 
She recently passed the Barr-Bodies test, the standard sex exam given to Olympic athletes, and it showed she was female. 
“There have been some women over the years who were required to take the test a second time be­ cause they failed it.’’ Dr. Richards told THE STAR. 
“ I’m being required to take it again because I passed it. That s not fair and I’m not going to stand for it. 
“If it turns out that this requirement of the 1977 
U.S. Open committee jeopardizes my acceptance for 

 the European tournaments, I will instruct my attor­ ney to institute a personal damage suit on the issue of discrimination.” 
The Barr-Bodies test Dr. Richards passed shows she has 24 percent female chromosomes — four per­ cent more than the cut-off used by Olympic officials. 
Dr. Anderson Mettleship, who performed the test, said he thought it “ very likely" that Renee was a genetic mosaic, someone who has both male and fe­ male chromosomes. 
Such mosaics are extremely rare, the doctor said. 
“ I ve taken the same test privately several times," Dr. Richards added. “The idea that I may be a mosaic is not a new one to me." 

 a tiger, I have become quieter, more communicative. “As a man. and especially as a tennis player, 
I was (mown as a ‘real bulldog.’ 
“ You know, the kind of locker room talk, ‘You’d better beat him straight away, because if it goes to three sets he’ll just grind you down with sheer determination.’ 
“I don’t have that kind of drive any more — I think it’s more a question of getting to be 42 rather than changing sex — and I can’t say I miss it too much." 
Dr. Richards, who keeps up with her medical specialty by studying and lecturing between matches, says she envisions a couple more years of professional tennis before resuming her career as an eye surgeon. 
“ I feel very strongly that there is. and should be, significant dif­ ferences between the sexes," she said. 
“I guess the reason that I final­ ly decided to take the step (the operation > was that I couldn’t have lived out my life with a blurred sexual identity." 
Dr. Richards gave a hoarse laugh that would have done Tallu­ lah Bankhead proud. 
“ I don’t mean that parents trying to raise children should think in terms of pink or blue ex­ clusively, but opting for androgen­ ous yellow isn t such a smart idea.’ 
Dr. 
Richards has a child. 
Nicky, 4, the result of a short­ lived marriage before the opera­ tion. I asked whether the little boy ever comes out to watch. 

“ No, Nicky is too young for that." Dr. Richards said, giving me the cold, tank commander’s glance. 
But he knows that I am a ten­ nis champion."

Four days later, I received a check for $125 in the mail from a friend in Michigan whom I hadn't contacted in six years! 
She enclosed a note that said she thought maybe my husband and I could use the money, that she had a little extra, and told us to accept it as a gift or pay it back later when we could. 
She had been reminded of me by a mutual friend with whom I had also lost touch over six years but who had recently written to ask me if I could help her find a teaching job in Florida.

WTT had three horses, one of which was Midnight, my daugh­ ter s special pet. The time came when we could no longer keep them. 
I found a cond home for them near a large field owned by a friend of mine. I gave the horses to her for nothing to insure that I would know where they were. 
Some time later, I was awak­ ened in the middle of the night by a very sad dream—that Midnight 

 was in a basement stall, crowded in with another pitiful horse, no food, the stall dirty. Midnight was looking in my direction for me to rescue him. 
Several days after, I went to visit Midnight at my friend's house, only to discover that she had sold him to a disreputable horse dealer, who in fact did keep horses in dirty basement stalls. 
Sad to say, by the time I got to the dealer's he had sold the horse to another dealer. I never did manage to find out what had fi­ nally happened to Midnight. — El­ eanor Terry. Manomet, Mass.

But once there, she stormed up the stairs, then shouted, “Joe, come quick!”

A 
FEW months ago 
I went through a lot of depressing days and sometimes I’d want to talk to someone, not anything really per­ sonal, just a phone conversation to hear someone's voice. 
Well, after mentally calling my boyfriend who was working in an­ other town, he rang within ten minutes. 
I wondered if his call might have been the result of mental te­ lepathy. but after all he called ev- 

Shirley Watkins ery day, so I thought I d try it on my mother. Within the hour the phone rang. 
It was my mother who said she hadn t meant to dial my number but was glad she did, as she had something to tell me anyway. 
I was baffled and decided to try an aunt who never calls me, I concentrated real hard, and at 
8:3o that evening the phone rang. 
“ Hi,” my aunt said, “ haven't talked to you in a long time. Just thought I'd see how you were doing.” — Shirley J.* Watkins.

Jimmy Carter writes for The Star 

By PRESIDENT CARTER 

• About 35o,ooo children live in foster homes, at an average cost throughout their childhoods of 
$6o,ooo. At least 1oo,ooo of them could be adopted. 
• Forty-five percent of the arrests for serious crimes are of young people under 18 years of age, and more than 9o percent of the children sent to correctional insti­ tutions last year were found guilty of offenses tor which adults would not have been punished at all. 
• The number of gonorrhea cases has tripled in the last ten years among children less than 14 years old. 
• Among young people age 15 to 19, the second most common cause of death is suicide. 
• And alcohol, drug abuse, and emotional problems are steadily increasing among both young peo­ ple and adults. 
As these statistics and many others show, the breakdown of the 
American family has reached ex­ tremely dangerous proportions. 
There can be no more urgent priority than to see that every de­ cision our government makes is designed to honor and support and strengthen the American family. 
The problems of the aged would be reduced if we would all obey the Biblical command to honor our father and mother. As Rabbi 
Abraham Joshua Heschel said: 
“One father finds it possible to sustain a dozen children, yet a dozen children find it impossible to sustain one father.” 
The fam ily was the first church. 
The fam ily was the first school. 
The family was the first govern­ ment. 
And for a child, this is still true. 
Our churches, our schools and our state, local and national gov­ ernments all have major responsi­ bilities to strengthen the Ameri­ can family, and when they fail, they themselves lose strength. 
If we want less government, we must have stronger families, for the government steps in by ne­ cessity when families have failed. 
It is clear that the national gov­ ernment should have a strong pro- family policy, but the fact is that our government has no family policy, and that is the same thing as an anti-family policy. 
Because of confusion or insensi­ tivity, our government’s policies have often actually weakened our families, and even destroyed them. 
Our present welfare system is both anti-work and anti-family. 
We have welfare policies in half our states that deny aid to chil-

 dren unless and until their father deserts them. 
As President, I intend to reform that system so that it encourages work and encourages family life and reflects both the competence and the compassion of the Ameri­ can people. 
We have urban renewal pro­ rams that shatter homes and amilies and entire neighbor­ hoods. You rarely see an inter­ state highway go through a golf course, but you’ve seen lots of them blast their way through neighborhoods where people have lived for generations That’s the kind of bureaucratic indifference we must end. 
We have transfer and assign­ ment policies in our armed ser­ vices that don’t take into account their impact on the families of the servicemen. 
We have tax policies that often seem to discriminate against fam­ ilies, particularly lower income 

Jimmy holds daughter Amy. families. For example, the so called “antigrandmother” provi­ sion that disallows a child care deduction if the family employs a relative closer than a cousin has just recently I “en abolished. 
The present personal tax deduc­ tion for dependents in effect pro­ vides a greater benefit for wealthy families than to middle income or poor families. 
Some people argue that income tax exemptions for children en­ courage large families. But I agree with Vice President Mon­ day, who says that at his house the tax laws were never discussed at those moments of decision. 
I have pledged to enact tax re­ form and one basic goal of any tax reform must be to help and strengthen our families. 
Past economic policies have been dismal failures. 
When the head of a family is out of work, the entire family suf­ fers, and not just in an economic 

 sense. There is a loss of dignity and pride and self-respect. 
Leonard Woodcock, the presi­ dent of the United Auto Workers, recently testified that when the unemployment rate in 
Flynt, 
Mich., reached 2o percent, it be­ came the city with the highest al­ coholism rate in America, its drug problem doubled, and cases of child and wife abuse soared. 
At a time when teenage preg­ nancy and illegitimate births are rising sharply, we need a compre­ hensive program of family plan­ ning, which would include adop­ tion and education and moral leadership, and would do every­ thing possible to prevent the need for abortion. 
In education, as we struggle with such problems as busing, we need to remember that our basic goal is quality education for every child, and that we need indivi­ dualized instruction for every stu­ dent. so that he or she can prog­ 

 ress at the fastest possible rate, and that whenever possible we want children to attend schools close to their homes. 
In the area of health, we need a comprehensive health care program, with emphasis on chil­ dren and on the prevention of dis­ ease—and we're going to enact such a program. 
We need to recognize the spe­ cial problems of the single-parent family. We need a national day­ care program. 
We need to change the ridicu­ lous Social Security regulations that prevents many elderly men and women from being married. 
In short, we need a government that thinks about the American family and cares about the Amer­ ican family and makes it every decision with the intent of strengthening the family. 
Vice President Mondale has proposed that each federal pro­ gram present a family impact statement, to analyze how it would affect the family, much as 
Federal programs now prepare environmental impact statements. 
We don't need a new bureaucra­ cy, but the President and Con­ gress should routinely conduct such an analysis when any major decision is made. This will be done. 
With the help of RFW Secre­ tary Joseph Califano, Vice Presi­ dent Mondale and many, many other concerned men and women, 
I intend to construct a Federal policy that will reverse the trends we have seen. 
The job will not be an easy one, but it is worth whatever effort may be required. The entire histo­ ry of the human race teaches us that the family unit is the best way for men and women to live their lives, the best way to raise children and the only solid foun­ dation to build a strong nation.

THE American family is in trouble. I’ve traveled all over America, and everywhere 
I found people deeply concerned about the loss of stability and the loss of values in our lives. 
The root of this problem is the steady erosion and weakening of our families. Some shocking sta­ tistics document the problem: 
• Forty percent of all marriages in America now end in divorce. 
• In 196o, one of every 2o women giving birth was not married; today it is about one in eight. 
• The extended family is all but extinct. Ac­ cording to one study, in 19oo in Boston half the households included parents, children and at least one other relative. Today the comparable figure is four percent. 
• One out of seven children, 8 6 million, live with a single parent, and we now have a larger percent of children who live in poverty than we did in 197o.

MR. JACK DAVIS of New York 
City tells about famous outlaws in his family tree: 
SINCE Tam a cousin of the fa­ mous Clantons of Tombstone, Ari­ zona, I’ve always heard a little different story about the famous 
Gunfight at the OK Corral than the usual one. 
Newman Haynes Clanton (Old 
Man Clanton) moved to Arizona after deserting from the Confed­ eracy during the Civil War. 
In Arizona, he and his sons, Bil­ ly, Ike and Phineas, and the two 
McLaury brothers, 
Frank and 
Tom, ran a successful cattle and horse business, mostly based on stealing. 
They also controlled many water holes. 
Other cattlemen paid the Clan­ ton’s protection money, or bought stolen cattle from them. This caused friction with the Earp gang, which wanted to do the same thing. 

THE STAR asked readers for the most interesting stories from their fami­ ly histories. The response was outstanding. Thousands of entries were received, telling amazing tales of triumph and tragedy, love and hate, religion and sin in a growing America. Excerpts from these two prize­ winning entries tell of the rugged and often violent life in the Wild West. 
E a r p s ’version of Gunfight at the OK Corral is untrue dfarftk I A 
Old Man Clanton: 
He went West 

The feud that led to the famous shootout came about because of a robbery scheme of the Earps. 
W’yatt Earp would supply Doc 
Holliday with information about gold shipments on the stage. Hol­ liday, sometimes with help from 
Clanton’s men, would rob the stage. 
During one such robbery, a friend of Wyatt Earp was shot and killed. Wyatt wanted to arrest the Clantons, but not Doc Holli­ day. 
Wyatt offered Ike Clanton re­ 

 ward money if he would bring in his friends who participated in the murder. Ike agreed—he needed money—but only if Wyatt would not talk about his deal. 
Wyatt did talk and Ike called off the deal. 
Wyatt found his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, and his friend, Doc 
Holliday, and went to arrest the 
Clantons and McLaurys. 
The showdown occurred at the 
OK Corral on Oct. 26, 1881. Ike 
Clanton and Tom McLaury were not armed. The Earps and Holli­ 

 day opened fire. 
Ike Clanton ran into a nearby house. He survived, but Tom and 
Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed. 
Virgil and Morgan Earp and 
Doc Holliday were wounded, but all of Earp’s gang survived the shootout. 
Later, 
Morgan was killed by Clanton friends. 
Popular legend often portrays the Gunfight at OK Corral as a battle between lawmen and out­ laws. In reality, it was a fight be­ tween two rival outlaw gangs.

PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ GIL­ 
BERT of San Antonio is the se­ cond-great granddaughter of Jose 
Policarpo (P olly) R odriguez, a famous Indian fighter, surveyor and guide in Texas in the 185os who later becam e a well-known minister, rancher and writer. The story, told in Polly’s own words, begins with a battle against Indian horse thieves in W est Texas in 
1856: 

THE bugler, Jim Tafolla, rode to meet two of the Indians. I called to him that he would get killed, but he went right on galloping af­ ter the Indians, shooting at them with his pistol. 
One Indian had a shield on his arm. and I could see when the

 bullets hit the shield they knocked the dust close around him as they glanced off. 
The shields are made of several thicknesses of rawhide, and get so tough and hard that unless a bul­ let strikes squarely and solid, it will bounce off. 
Tafolla kept advancing and shooting. The Indian kept his shield whirling from side to side, and the bullets glanced off. When close up, Tafolla’s pistol jammed and wouldn’t fire. 
The Indian shot with his bow and Tafolla struck at him with his pistol. The Indian dodged and es­ caped Tafolla had an overcoat

 rolled up and tied to the front of his saddle. The arrow struck it and cut about 5o holes in it, then entered Tafolla’s body next to the hip bone. 
The Indian ran back to cover, turning to see Tafolla fall, since he thought he had killed him. The other Indian must have been wounded, because he ran back first, with a limp. 
The Indians got behind some rocks where it was hard to get at them. The sergeant said to me: 
' Polly, do you think we can get those Indians?” 
I said: ‘ Sergeant, we ll lose two or three men before you get them.” 
The sergeant said: “ Let them alone. We’ve got the horses and things they left in camp. Let ’em go ” 
One of our men, Martin, was pretty badly wounded by a gun­ shot. When I came up, the lower part of his lungs were hanging from the wound. 
The sergeant decided to go to 
Fort McKavett, about 4o miles away. I had never been there, nor had I ever been in the country just where we were then. 
It was late in the afternoon when we started. I knew the di­ rection and took the lead. 
When night came on it was dark and cloudy, and we couldn’t see anything. But the breeze was blowing, and while it lasts it keeps the same course. 
So I guided myself after dark by the Breeze. I kept my course so that the breeze was always on my right cheek. 
About I a.m. the moon rose. A little later we saw some large white object far ahead. The ser­ geant wanted to know what it was. I said: “ I don’t know, but I think it’s the fort.” 
When we reached the fort, the men were so glad they picked me up and carried me around. But in spite of our relief, Martin died about an hour later. 
The life of an Indian fighter and guide was grizzly business. Those who only read romantic stories of the Wild West often were shocked by the real thing, as another story from Polly reveals. Again, Polly is after Indians who have stolen horses: 

The man jumped in front of the 
Indians. He was a splendid shot, but never had seen an Indian. 
He leveled his gun at one who was cutting meat and shot him dead, hitting him right in the low­ er end of the nose. 
The Indians were all running and jumping over the bluff. I fired at one, and he left a bloody trail. I was sorry afterwards that I shot him. It was not necessary as they were already running. 
We got the things they left in their camp, but the stolen horses were farther away in a thicket. It was now nearly dark, and we fig­ ured we would get shot if we went after the horses. 
We returned to our own horses, and the next morning came back to the scene. The Indians had car­ ried off the dead Indian and the horses. 
I told the sergeant it was use­ less to follow them, because they would scatter and we could never catch them. 
I had scalped the dead Indian before we left the night before be­ cause a lady at Camp Verde said to me: “ Polly, bring me a scalp.” 
I took it to her but she wouldn’t have it. She said in a frightened voice, “ I didn’t think you would kill an Indian to get it.” 
• Just before the Civil War, af­ ter 12 years as an Indian fighter, surveyor, and guide for the Army, 
Polly married and purchased land 

 near San Antonio. He became one of the wealthiest and best-known men in the area. 
His sturdy, stone house with a ground floor designed like a fort, was known as Fort Polly. The two-story home had little port holes in the walls and a high stone fence used to protect the livestock and family from Indian raids. 
Polly also became a famous 
Methodist preacher and built a church with his own hands in 1882. 
The church still stands and has services held in it. 
In the 189os, Polly dictated his memoirs. The book, “The Old 
Guide,” is a major source of Tex­ as folk stories today. 
In 19o3, at age 74, Polly married a second lime—his bride was only 
15. That marriage produced four children, the last born in 1913, when Polly was 84. He died of pneumonia the next year and was buried near the church he built. 
On his granite tombstone are in­ scribed these words:

By BOB BOYD 
CLAUDINE Longet is serving her jail sen­ tence in virtual isolation in a tiny prison con­ demned as unfit for human habitation. 
She decided to move straight in to Aspen’s squalid seven-cell Pitkin County Jail after a secret conference with her ex-husband, singer Andy Wil­ liams, and the lawyer she now loves, Ron Austin. 
She then told them: “I want to do my time as soon as possible and I want to do it here in 
Aspen.” 
She telephoned the Sheriff, Dick Kienast, and fixed a date for Monday, April 18. It meant that 
Claudine would be the last woman to be admitted to the seven-cell jail before it is closed this month. 
On that Monday she drove her three children from her $1oo,ooo home and left them with her sis­ ter Danielle. 
At 6:3o p.m. she was picked u by Ron Austin, and together wit! 
Danielle she walked into the Sher­ iff’s office. 
At 7 p.m. she became prisoner 
No. 5 in the tiny cell block, serv­ ing 3o days for the shooting death of her lover, Vladimir “Spider” 
Sabich. 
This was how Claudine started her life as a convict: 
At the office she was met by deputy Maureen Higgins. Sheriff’s secretary 
Miss Whitney Wulff said: 
“She was photographed, ordered to strip, body searched and fingerprinted. 
“She had carried in only a small toilet bag. 
This was searched and returned to her along with a book and writing ma­ terial. Her clothes were taken away, and she was issued with a plain white coverall.” 
At 7:45 p.m., Claudine was shown to her cell — a short dis­ tance from six male cells occu­ pied by four short-term prisoners. 
She carried in two blankets, two sheets and a pillow. At 8 p m. the door was locked. She read un­ til the lights went out and then went to sleep after drinking a cup of cold water. 
At 7:3o a.m., a male deputy banged on the door, and Claudine awoke to the reality of her first day in jail. Her cell has two bunk beds and measured 14 ft by 16 ft. 
The walls are pale yellow and covered with obscene graffiti. At any time she may have to share

 the streets of As- ve Ron Austin. 

Cell walls are covered with dirty graffiti’ 

 it with another woman prisoner awaiting trial. It has a toilet and a shower stall, and a small stool. 
At 8:3o, breakfast was served 
— scrambled eggs and bacon de­ livered from the kitchen of nearby 
Aspen Valley Hospital and served in paper cartons. 
There is no routine and no work in the Pitkin County Jail so Clau­ dine, like the male prisoners, spent her first day in virtual isola­ tion, sitting, reading, and some­ times glancing up at the light fil­ tering through thick unbreakable glass set high up on the wall. 
Her one consolation was that she could get time off for good be­ havior, and the predictions were that she would get it. If she earned the maximum remission she would be out in 23 days. 
At 12:3o p.m. the cell door banged again, and Claudine ac­ cepted her second meal — boiled beef, peas and french fries. Up­ stairs in the office, Miss Wulff, 

Bank slip puts a customer on the defensive 
BANK staff flew into a panic the day Johnny W. Wade arrived to make a withdrawal. 
For on the back of the slip he handed the teller was written: 
“This is a stick-up. Give me all the money.” 
It wasn’t the kind of withdrawal 
Wade had in mind, at all. He stood there calmly as the teller stepped on the silent alarm. 
He was still standing there when police arrived at the Nation­ al City Bank branch in Cleveland, 
Ohio. 
But after comparing his writing against that on the slip, they quickly freed him. The hold-up note had been written by someone else who lost his nerve. 

TRIBE WANTS MEDICINE MEN IN HEALTH 
PROGRAM 

HUNDREDS of Navajo miners want their union’s health fund to pay for the fees charged by . . . their medicine men. 
The Indians, on the reservation near Kayenta, Ariz., use regular physicians to treat their physical injuries, but often rely on medi­ cine men to ease aches and pains and emotional problems. 

State Rep. Daniel Peaches, a full-blooded Navajo, said this week: 
“The medicine man is more than someone who just shakes a stick and rattles beads. 
“ He is a highly intelligent per­ son who has been trained to un­ derstand the Indian people, their legends, their world and their uni­ verse.” 
Peaches himself visited a medi­ cine man who cured him of a burning itching sensation that 

 gradually became so bad he start­ ed to lose weight. 
“ I couldn’t sleep or eat," he said. “None of the doctors I went to could help me even though they prescribed several different kinds of medicine.” 
After six weeks of suffering he went to a medicine man on the 
Kayenta reservation who held an all-night singing ceremony. 
“ Within two days, the itching was gone,” Peaches said. 
Peaches, who had two uncles who were medicine men, said only persons with intelligent minds and intuitive strength be­ come medicine men. 
“Some of the prayers and sounds are very complicated,” he 

 said. Peaches said he has seen medicine men prove effective in treating a mimber of different dis­ eases — even mental disorders. 
“Just like a highly trained sur­ geon, a medicine man exudes con­ fidence,” he added. “You feel it in his presence. It’s a feeling that here is someone who can help. 
The number of medicine men on the 25,ooo-square mile reserva­ tion has declined steeply over the years. 
Said Peaches: “When the gov­ ernment forced compulsive edu­ cation on the Navajo, the medi­ cine man and our culture was destroyed. Many of the ancient ceremonies have been lost. Few of our young people are learning the ceremonies and the legends.” 
The mine workers union did not say if they would grant the Nava­ jos’ request. 

 accepted the first of four crank calls. They were all from men wanting to speak “to the terrible woman Claudine.” 
She could in fact accept some calls at the discretion of her jail­ ers, and is allowed to make one phone call a day. She made her one call to her children. 
“There were no complaints,” said Miss Wulff. “She has a posi­ tive attitude." In the afternoon 
Claudine was allowed into the exercise yard alone. It is smaller then her cell, measuring six feet by IO and surrounded by 12 foot high fences topped with barbed wire. 
At 5:3o p.m., she took her third and last meal of the day — again meat and two vegetables. And at 
6:3o p.m. her cell door slammed shut for the rest of the night. 
There are no recreational facili­ ties beyond a small library from which prisoners can select one book at a time. 
Terry Norris, Claudine’s proba­ tion officer, explained that Clau­ dine had to serve her sentence be­ fore September. Last month it was announced that Pitkin County 
Jail was being condemned. Its one attraction, however, was twice-a- week, two-hour visiting on Tues­ days and Thursdays. 
“ If Claudine had waited she would have had to go to Glenwood 
Springs some 4o miles away, where visiting is more restrict­ ed,” said Mr. Norris. 
Claudine’s first visitor was ex­ husband Andy who brought along the couple’s three children. 
Sgt. Rick Kralicek, the day shift supervisor at the jail, told 
THE STAR that as Andy was ac­ companying their children he was allowed to visit Claudine with them. Only blood relatives are normally allowed. 
“ If he came alone, he would not be let in. But as long as he was a parent accompanying his children he would be. 
“ Whenever her children visit, the meetings will take place in an interrogation room. 
“We do not want the children to have to go into a jail cell.” 
After his visit, Andy moved in­ to Claudine’s home with the chil­ dren and her sister. 
THE STAR learned from sever­ al sources that Claudine is writing a book on the killing and the trial.

B B much you really know abovtlfie opposite sex 

By ARLENE HECTOR 

MEN and women will get along better when they clear up some common misconceptions about each other, says a leading psy­ chologist. 

Dr. Salvatore Didato. who prac­ tices in New York, has composed a simple test—printed below— which exposes some of the wrong ideas the sexes have about each other. 
While men and women do think and behave differently, this is more because of their different training than from instinct, Dr. 
Didato told THE STAR. 

“ Women are more concerned with human events that involve growth, suffering and nurturing, whereas men are more interested in commerce, justice and power.” he said. 

“ But the way people think is 

 pretty nearly always environmen­ tal. 
“ lf you brought up a woman to take over a m an’s role, she could do that easily. 
“ In some cultures, women do the hunting and fishing and men stay home with the children. 
“ But Western society is not fe­ male oriented. Men make all the laws here.” 
And. he added, many of the as­ sumptions men and women make about each other are based not on fact but on the way society is or­ ganized and children are taught. 
To find out how much you know about the opposite sex—and how much you are assuming because it s what you’ve learned—take Dr. 
Didato's true-false quiz. 
It looks easy, but be careful. 
The answers will probably sur­ prise you. 

Are these tree or false ? 

ANSWER true or false to the following statements: 
1. Men have a greater capacity for feeling happy than women. 
2. Women have more verbal fluency than men. 
3. Women have more sex fantasies about men than men have about women. 
4. There is no difference in dreams between men and women. 
5. Wives understand their husbands better than husbands un­ derstand wives. 
6. Husbands tend to be more intelligent than their wives. 
7. Men are more likely than women to keep their heads in a crisis. 
8. Men are more honest than women. 

HOW DID YOU RATE? 

HERE are the answers to the sex differences quiz above. 
How many did you get right? 
1. FALSE. Women have a wider range of emotion than men. They can feel greater happiness, but at the other extreme, they can feel more unhappiness, too. 
2. TRUE. Females develop lan­ guage skills earlier than males, and retain the edge in verbal fluency between the sexes. 
3. FALSE. Alfred Kinsey, the sex researcher, found men have many more sex fantasies about women than women have about men. 
4. FALSE. Dream narratives collected from a wide number of men and women showed that men dream more about men than they do about women, while women dream equally as often about men and women. 

5. FALSE. Studies done by the 
Veteran's 
Administration show that husbands have more insight about their wives’ personalities than wives have about theirs. 

6. TRUE 
Many studies have verified that women tend to m ar­ ry men they admire intellectually. 
Men. on the other hand, tend to shun women who they sense are intellectually superior to them. 

7. FALSE. Women generally are more easily upset by details or trivial mishaps than men are. 
But they usually retain their cool when big problems such as death, illness and financial loss come up. 

8 FALSE. One study of more than 
5,ooo men and women showed that although women are just as evasive as men, a man is much more capable of telling lies. 

FIRE HALF THE BOSSES, SAYS AN EXPERT 

AMERICAN industry should get rid of half of its bosses, according to a top psychologist. “ Adults are quite capable of handling their lives out­ side their homes at their jobs,' said behavioral expert Alfred J. Mar­ row. “ They need fewer supervisors and managers, not m ore.” 
Marrow, president of the American Board of I’sychology said that many firms would be better off if they allowed their own employees to participate in solving company problems. 

Find out how much iou really kneiif shout the bes! food to eat 

By CHRISTINA KIRK 
HOW MUCH do you know about nutrition? Enough to know that eating a lot and getting the nour­ ishment you need are two differ­ ent things? 
That’s a good start, but Dr. Zak 
Sabry says that most of what you ' think you know is based on mis­ conceptions and probably false. 
Dr. Sabry, a biochemist who re­ cently headed a massive nutrition survey by the Canadian Govern­ ment, says the average consumer 

 lacks the knowledge to distinguish between the foods with high nutri­ tional value and the junk. 
He has tried to simplify this by writing a book with Ruth Fremes called 
Nutriscore: 
The 
Rate- 
Yourself Plan For Better Nutri­ tion. (Methuen, $6.95). 
He has also prepared this nutri­ tion quiz exclusively for STAR readers. Test yourself first, and then read Dr. Sabry’s informative answers. 
Are these tree or false? 

ANSWER true or false to these ten statments. 
1. Vegetables grown on chemical fertilizers are not as nutritious as those grow-n on manure. 
2. Bran is the best form of roughage in a diet. 
3. Snacks between meals can fie as nourishing as main meals 
4 Frozen orange juice is as nutritious as fresh orange juice 
5. Polyunsaturated fats are lower in calories than saturated fats. 
6. An orange drink that tastes like orange juice is as nutritious as genuine orange juice. 
7. A daily supplement of vitamin E boosts sexual performance. 
8. Eating garlic will reduce high blood pressure. 
9. The more athletic you are, the more protein you will need. 
1o. Once you stop exercising, your muscles will slowly change to fat. 

HOW W E U DID YOU JUDGE? % 

I. FALSE: Vegetables get nour­ ishment through their roots. 
Whatever they feed on has to be dissolved in water. Since the roots don't have teeth to chew on inso­ luble organic stuff like manure, the plants will have to wait for the bacteria in the soil to convert the m anure to the soluble ni­ trates. These dissolve in water and get absorbed by the roots. 
The chemical fertilizers are in the form of nitrates and get used by the vegetables in the same way. only faster. The result is the same nutritional value whether the vegetables were grown on chemical fertilizers or on manure. 
2. FALSE: Recent studies found that bran may not be the best roughage, especially when milled out of the whole wheat flour then added back on cereals and in muf­ fins. It is better to leave it in its natural form and eat whole wheat bread and cereals than add it to refined white flour and cereals. 
The roughage of vegetables and fruits was found to be of higher value than the bran we get from wheat and other cereals. 
3. TRUE: Our bodies get the nourishment from foods any time we choose to eat, at mealtime or in-between meals. If we eat light­ ly at meals and have well-chosen snacks in-between, our bodies will appreciate the spacing of the sup­ ply of nutrients and calories much more than if we eat one or two big meals a day. 
It is important to choose snacks wisely. Tney should be low in ca­ lories and high in nutrients. The best ones include skim milk, fruits (even dried like raisins), vegetables (raw like carrot and celery sticks), breads, buns and 

 muffins and sandwiches of cheese, peanut butter and lean meats. 
4. TRUE: Freezing and concen­ tration, by removing some of the water from the orange juice, have very little effect on the nutritional value of orange juice. 

5. FALSE: Fats are fats and they give us nine calories per gram or about 25o calories per ounce. The difference in the nutri­ tional value is that the polyunsa­ turated fat lowers the amount of cholesterol in the blood and the saturated fat raises it. 
6. FALSE: You normally get a lot of additives (including an arti­ ficial flavor) and fewer nutrients in a drink than you do in a juice. 
7. FALSE: Though some peo­ ple swear it to be true, there is no evidence or scientific reason for vitamin E to enhance sexual de­ sire or performance. 
In fact large doses can be dan­ gerous. 
8. FALSE: It might keep ene­ mies away and make life less stressful. But it might also keep your friends away and make life less enjoyable. 

9. FALSE: Exercise will help tone muscles but will not increase their protein mass. The amount of protein in the muscle is the same whether it is toned or not. 
1o. FALSE: It might feel like it, but your muscles will always have the same composition whether or not you exercise.. 
Without exercise the muscles be­ come flabby, and if you overeat, you build up fatty tissue around them That is why they feel as if they are changing to fat.

Here’s what scares me most... 

STORY BY DONNA LAWSON: PHOTOS BY GENE SPATZ 

ANYONE who says a youngster’s life is a picnic isn’t listening to children. Much goes on behind the giggles and happy smiles of 
America’s 4o million kids. 
There’s the fear of the class­ room bully, the panic over paren­ tal arguments, the fear they might separate and the awful hurt of not being asked to a birth­ day party. 
“I can say to my cnna, » re­ member how it felt not to be invit­ ed to a birthday party,’ but the fact is I do not remember,” says 
New 
York psychologist 
Carol 
Klein. 
“ I can recall rejection similar to what she experiences now. But I cannot in empathy touch her ach­ ing soreness.” 
Ms. Klein, who has taught writ­ 

 ing to children in New York and 
New Jersey public schools, and has written a book called The 
Myth Of The Happy Child, told 
THE STAR: 
”1 used to think I could spare my children the guilt and uncer­ tainty of my own extreme youth. 
But now I know that’s impossible. 
All I can do is sympathize and let them know they aren’t alone In their feelings.” 
Not to take a child’s fear or dis­ appointments seriously is wrong in her opinion. Reassurance Is needed by everyone and should be offered In a matter of fact manner, as often as possible. 
Here a group of second grade students at the 
New 
Lincoln 
School in New York City discuss their secret fears. 

Children reveal the secret fears that hide behind millions of smiles 

I FEEL so sad when people tease me. like when they say Juliette is a slowpoke. And it isn’t even true. I’m the second fastest kid in the class, at least the fastest girl. The TV also scares me a lot. especially the shooting. And I get scared of very high cliffs, like the ones in Maine where we go in the summer. And I don't like bugs because some are poisonous and make your legs swell up like elephant legs. 

Julie Lund, 8 

I WORRY most nights about burglars. I get so scared I can’t go to sleep. We’ve never been robbed, so I don’t know why I worry , I just do. I think it will happen some time. I’m also afraid of getting lost, like the time it happened at the museum. My mother was walking on ahead of me, and suddenly she was gone. It seemed like forever before we found each other. I also used to be scared of bullies. But now I know the way to control boys is to say you’re going to kiss them.

IMAGINE vou are a television talent scout. Three group photographs of beautiful women are laid before you. In each photo there is a future 
TV superstar. AH you have to do is find her. The photo at left is of the 1966 pledge class of the Delta Delta Delta sorority at the Univer­ sity of Texas at Austin. Somewhere among those well-scrubbed faces 

 is Farrah Fawcett, a 19-year-old from Corpus Christi who was the sen­ sation of pledge week that year at Texas, but was never initiated into the sorority because of her poor grades. Can you spot Farrah in the photo? The center photograph is from the 1966 yearbook of the Brooke 
Hill private girls school in Birmingham, Ala. It shows the Quill and 

Amy Carter totes her own bag, just like dad 

IF President Carter carries his own bags, then daughter Amy, 9, can too, idle Secret 
Service agents must be figuring in photo above. Said mom Rosalynn: “ Amy has this unassuming attitude about what is going on about her. I hope she can stay that way.” 

Archbishop Sheen is still going strong at 82 

AS A radio-TV preacher in the 5os. Catholic 
Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen got more fan mail than Hollywood idols did. Less visible today, 
Archbishop Sheen is celebrating 5o years of priesthood. Said His Excellency, 82: “ I thank 
God for letting me serve 
Him so long.” 

WITH slicked hair, white silk scarf, gold watch chain and jeweled parakeet broach, 
Richard Thomas, 25, looks like he means it when he says: “ I don’t want to be typecast as 
John-Boy Walton. I want people to know I can do other things.” However, wife Alma and nine-month-oldf son Richard Jr. can still bring out the Walton’s Mountain in Richard. Said 
Alma: “ He’s not Hollywood. At home, he’s really just an old fashioned family man.”

A LEMONADE stand can make you big money, says an expert on making extra dollars. 
One individual—who refuses, for tax reasons, to be named— clears about $16o-per-day from his stand. 
First, you need a location crowded with thirsty people. Pos­ sibilities include carnivals, rock festivals, local swimming pools— places where there are outdoor summertime activities. 
Next, you need the lemonade. It has to be fresh and good. 
Assuming a case of 12o-14o lem­ ons costs about $6, and you get two glasses of lemonade per lem­ on, that s a cost of about 2.5 cents per glass for lemons. 
Sugar, cups, ice and location rental push the cost to about 6 cents per glass. 
Sell each glass for 35 to 4o cents 
—a fair price, and people will pay it—and you’ll make 29 to 34 cents a glass. 
Use this time-honored technique to draw folks to your stand and keep them coming back: 
1. Slice the ends off a lemon and cut what’s left in half. 
2. Take one half (the other half’s for another glass) and quar­ ter it. From that half, you now have four hunks. 
3. Put these hunks in a glass of about 16 ounces or less and mash them with a wooden pestle. Or mash the juice into the glass with a hand held lemon squeezer. 
4. Put in about a quarter-cup of sugar, some ice cubes and water. 
5. Place a 16-ounce paper, cup upside down over the glass and snake vigorously. 
6. Hand a frothy cupful of fresh lemonade to a thankful customer. 
You can get cups from a paper wholesaler. Be sure to buy sugar wholesale, too.

Why women smile more than men 
WOMEN smile much more often than men, and they do it quicker and easier, experts report. 
In one recent study, researchers greeted people on the street and found that women smiled more 
'than men. 
In a second study, students were asked to listen to a three- minute tape recording of two men talking Some students listened by themselves, and others listened with someone of their own sex 
The results: Women who lis­ tened alone smiled more than lone males. Women smiled even more often when sitting with a companion while men sitting to­ gether smiled very little. 
Dr. Wade Mackey, who con­ ducted both studies at Louisiana 
State University, said the reason women smile more is that they have been conditioned to do so. 
* 
Even with women’s liberation, it appears they respond to having been taught to be bright and cheerful.

“I’ve been into a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and that’s why I had to leave Cali­ fornia. I came to Manhattan to relax, and that’s what I’m doing.” Assorted noses at Re­ gine’s did not get to enjoy the same luxury. 

PLAYING the role of the mother of Jesus in the smash TV movie, Jesus Of Nazareth, may have done great things for Olivia Hussey’s ca­ reer as an actress, but it played havoc on her career as a real mother to Alexander, her four-year-old son by Dino Martin Jr. Vowed 
Olivia, 25: “ I’ll never make another film without taking Alexander with me. I saw him only five weeks during the eight months of filming. He’s such a beautiful child, I don’t want to miss any more of him growing up.

JEANE DIXON PREDICTS SOUTH AMERICANS 
■ 
HERE, exclusively for readers of THE 
STAR, world-renowned psychic Jeane 
Dixon concludes her quarterly predictions by looking abroad. 
She foresees a world lifted with danger and intrigue and some astonishing events in the nations America once con­ sidered to be among her clos­ est allies. 

LATIN AM ERICA: The most powerful countries in Latin Artier ica will turn against the United 
States. It w ill not be caused by the Panama Canal controversy. 
And they will not turn toward Cu- 

WHI TURN AGAINST U.S. 

 ba or the Soviet Union, either. 

Brazil, Argentina and Chile will decide that the United States can no longer protect either itself or its friends. So they w ill form their own alliance to defend South 
America from subversion, just as the United States used to do when our government believed in the 
Monroe Doctrine. The hottest spot in Latin America will be one of the smallest spots in the Carib­ bean, the tiny nation of Haiti. 

President Duvalier is in grave danger of invasion from Cuba, which could topple him and seize his capital in a matter of hours not days. 
Castro’s troops, which were used with deadly effect in Angola, are already being prepared for their next mission, and this inva­ sion will be much closer to home.

Department thinks, but for years! 
Tile leadership of China will con­ tinue to change, violently and ab­ ruptly. A time of troubles has de­ scended upon the Chinese people. 
And when it is over, we will not recognize the shape of their gov­ ernment and what it has become. 
Meanwhile, do not forget that there is another China—The Re­ public of China on Taiwan with which the United States has a mu­ tual defense treaty. 
The American government will try to abandon Taiwan and estab­ lish full diplomatic relations with 
Peking. This will not succeed be­ cause the Republic of China will not roll over and play dead. 
Taiwan w ill secretly develop nuclear weapons and will be will­ ing to use them rather than sub­ mit to Communist rule. 
The State Department w ill have to fear our ally China as much as it used to fear our enemy China. 
SOVIETS IN AFRICA: For the 
United States, the most dangerous international event of 1977 w ill be the recent visit to Southern Africa by Soviet President Nicholai Pod- gomy. 
It laid the foundation for later foreign policy disasters for the 
United States. 
When President Podgomy re­ turned to Moscow, he took with him a secret present for his col­ leagues—control over a vital sea­ port in Southern Africa which will threaten world shipping lanes and imperil American naval forces in the Pacific and South Pacific. 
SOVIET UNION: Leonid Brezh­ nev, chairman of the Soviet Com­ munist Party, is still in firm con­ trol. I do not sense any challenge to him. 
There are struggles taking place behind the scenes, but they are not threats to Mr. Brezhnev. 
They are squabbles among the men who would like to be his heirs. 
Ill health will force Mr. Brezh­ nev to step aside sooner than he thinks. That is when a real chal­ lenge will arise to endanger the rule of Mr. Brezhnev’s successor, 
Andrei Kirilenko. 
UGANDA: Idi Amin, the dicta­ tor of Uganda, has shocked the world with his brutality. I sense that plans for Amin’s downfall are already underway, not in Uganda, and not in Washington. They do 

Alex Haley: W ill write another book but faces danger over it. 

ALEX HALEY: The success of his book Roots will contin­ ue for quite a number of years, and as a result he will have to worry more about the money he is making than anything else. 
I think Haley may travel out of the U.S. as a member of a diplomatic mission or as a goodwill ambassador. 
There will be a literary award given in his name and there may also be a building named after him. 
Haley will write another book—maybe about the Civil 
War. It will be a great suc­ cess if he publishes it in April 
1978 or April 1981. 
He will face some danger white traveling and lecturing in connection with the book. 
In the spring of 1979 and 
198o, he could become the victim of a hostile group who would use him as a victim or hold him hostage. 

 not involve the CIA. They involve several neighboring African coun­ tries. In this instance, Africa will attend to its own problems, very forcefully and, I believe, soon. 
M IDDLE EAST: 
The secret 
CIA payments to King Hussein of 
Jordan have been much in the headlines recently. But I sense that the full story has not yet come to light. 
When it does, those payments will appe ar to be in the best inter­ est of the United States. But by that time, grave damage will have been done to prospects for peace in the Middle East. 
LEBANON: 
Like 
Humpty 
Dumpty, Lebanon will never be entirely put back together again. 
Several tiny, feuding states will be formed from its wreckage and they will become still another sore spot in the already tender 
Middle East. They will provide still more kindling to ignite a fu­ ture explosion there. 
TROUBLE BREWS IN A 
EUROPEAN HOT SPOT 
BALKANS: I suggest that the public and especially the foreign policy planners in tile State De­ partment look ahead to the next crisis. 
Look this time to Europe, to the 
Balkan Peninsula, where so many of Europe's wars and ours have begun, including World War I. 
As I have been saying for months, long before this subject came up in the ^presidential de­ bates last fall, look particularly to 
Yugoslavia. 
Forces are already in motion that have the potential to create there, on a larger scale, the trage­ dy of Lebanon all over again. 
But this time, both the United 
States and the Soviet Union would 

 be deeply and dreadfully in­ volved. 
EURO PE: For two of Ameri­ ca’s closest allies, this year will bring economic and political dis­ order. Britain and Italy will draw nearer and nearer the abyss of to­ tal collapse. Last-minute emer­ gency aid from the United States will not save them from chaos. 
They will have to rescue them­ selves, or they will not be rescued at all. 
There is a brighter future ahead, however, for Northern Ire­ land. That sorrowing, suffering land will have less violence than before and will gradually work its way down the long road toward peace.

Birthday to mark end of a bad year for Crosby 

BING CROSBY was celebrating his 73rd birthday this week and hoping his run of bad luck during the last year is finally over. 
Bing is still recovering from the injuries he sustained; several months ago when he fell off the stage while taping a television special. 
The past year also included the embarrassment of having his son ' 
Lindsay arrested on charges of cavorting naked in a hotel swim­ ming pool and the disastrous flop of his family’ show on Broadway. 
Friends are starting to worry about Bing s health, remembering how he barely escaped death two years ago when he suffered a lung ' infection. 
His close friend Bob Hope be­ lieves Bing would have died from the recent fall had he not grabbed some scenery while tumbling from the stage into the orchestra pit. 
Convalescing at his California home, Bing says of his career: 
“I’m a fellow that people can listen to and think they could have done just as well if they had tried a little. People don’t see anything pretentious about me. 
“But if I had to start my career as a young man today, I d proba­ bly try to be shrewd and that would be a mistake. I never made

 a decision about what I was going to do when I was young. 
“I just let people tell me what to do — but I made sure they were people with good track rec­ ords. 
“Today I would probably try to make all the decisions myself, thinking I knew all the answers. 
But the competition is tough. 
There’s a list of entertainers as long as your arm .” 
Bing says many of today’s per­ formers are so wrapped up in their work that there is no release for them. It leads to unhappiness and lots of conflicts. 
“All my life, I have had other things — like golf, fishing and reading,” he explained. “ Maybe they get recognition too early. It came to me gradually.” 
Crosby, aware of his increasing age and frailty, says he does not fear death. 
“I do fear for the children,” he says. “ I would like to live long enough to see them through their twenties.” 
Bing has three teenaged chil­ dren by his second wife, Kathryn. 
“I’d like to know where they are going and that they’re going to be good citizens,” he adds. 
“You never know — five minutes after they’re out the door every­ thing can go wrong.” 

By WAYNE DARWEN 

THIEVES have hijacked mil­ lions of dollars worth of raw coffee beans since the price of the beverage started soaring. 
Authorities say the professional hijackers operate mainly on the nation’s waterfronts, ana rake in up to $5oo,ooo per heist. 
. Hardest hit by the thieves is the 
Port of New York, where nearly half of the 2.5 billion pounds of imported, unroasted coffee beans arrive each year. 
Since December, at least 16 cof­ fee trucks have been stolen from piers and warehouses at the port and authorities estimate the loss at between $1 million and $2 mil­ lion. 
“There is almost one big heist a day and although we have spe­ cial squads on the job, it is diffi­ cult to keep up with it,” said FBI agent Bruce Botman, supervisor of the agency’s hijacking squad in 
New York City. 
His team recently swooped down on the docks of Brooklyn and posted a shotgun watch for coffee bean hijackers. 
As they watched, three men forced a truck driver at gunpoint to drive off with 75,ooo pounds of 
Ecuadorian coffee valued at about 
$2oo,ooo wholesale. 
“There wasn’t much we could do while they had the driver at the end of a gun,” Botman told 
THE STAR. “So we waited until they had gotten about three blocks down the road before we made our move. 
“We forced the truck to the side of the road with our guns drawn and made the arrests without a shootout.” 
In another case, Botman and his agents raided the Madison 
House Coffee Company in Brook­ lyn and arrested seven people on charges of possessing 2oo bags of stolen coffee. 
Nine days later, the agents ar­ rested another man who was load­ ing 27o more bags of stolen coffee 

 onto a Madison House truck on 
Staten Island, N Y. 
Hijacking or possessing any kind of stolen goods bound for in­ terstate shipment is a federal crime punishable by a maximum fine of $5,ooo, or IO years in pris­ on, or both. 
Nonetheless, 
Botman says: 
“The number of hijackings is going up with the price of coffee.” 
The price of coffee began sky­ rocketing last year and is now hovering around $4-a-pound. 
Because most of the thefts in­ volve unroasted beans, the FBI believes that some roasting firms are knowingly buying stolen beans at a price well below what they would normally pay. 
FBI officials are not sure if criminal syndicates like the Mafia 

 are involved in the hijackings. 
They say they are more in­ clined lo believe that the hijack­ ings are arranged by coffee bro­ kers who hire others to perform the actual stick-ups. 
The problem is not only con­ fined to New York. Recently in 
New Jersey, three men and a teenaged boy were arrested while unloading a tractor-trailer full of hijacked coffee valued at $178,ooo. 
In Boston, three trucks carry­ ing processed, canned coffee have disappeared in the last few months. 
And in San Francisco thieves who stole 12,ooo cans of ground coffee worth $48,ooo peddled the goods by advertising on C B. ra­ dio. But they were caught after other C B. buffs called the FBI. 

IRS admits destroying 
264 million tax records 
THE INTERNAL Revenue Ser­ vice destroys about 264 million tax documents a year instead of using them to catch tax cheats. 4 
“ We would like to match all these documents with income ‘ax returns,” said IRS spokesman 
Tony Bombardiere. "Bul we dont have the money." 
He told THE STAR: “ Last year the IRS received about 462 million such documents, but only 4o per­ cent were matched with returns. 
The rest were destroyed.” 
The documents are sent to the 
IRS by employers, banks, individ­ ual taxpayers and others required to report financial information. 
They include such items as the 
W-2 form for wages and the 1o99 form for interest on outside in­ vestments and savings accounts. 
Bombardiere stressed that no returns are destroyed. “By 198o, we hope to be able to match IOO percent of these documents to re­ turns.” 
That would cost the government 
$14o million annually, ne added. 
“ But we figure that the govern­ ment would collect $46o million from 4 8 million taxpayers if we had a IOO percent match-up.” 
Unfortunately, such an exhaus­ tive match-up would also uncover about $34o million in overpay­ ments, he said. Those would have to be refunded to taxpayers. 
Since the government would have to pay $14o million for the 
IOO percent match-up and would then have to refund $34o million in overpayments, it would actually end up losing $2o million in the process. 
But Bombardiere said the gov­ ernment would prefer to call the arrangement spending $14o mil­ lion for an $8oo million benefit. 
“We add up the collections and refunds,” he explained, "since our mission is to collect and cor­ rect tax.” 
The spikesman said the IRS first looked into matching docu- , ments with returns in the early 
196os when computers were intro­ duced in the tax collection pro­ cess. 
For the past IO years, he said the government has matched up 
4o percent of the documents with returns. 
Going strong - with another’s heart 

EMMANUEL VITRIA is the longest living heart transplant recipient in the world. 
Eight years after he re­ ceived his transplant, his wife Josette, shown with him at left, still gives him three shots a day of a drug that stabilizes his rate of blood coagulation. 
After the shots, Vitria, 
57, of Marseilles, France, likes to have a cup of cof­ fee and some biscuits and then exercise on his bike. 

“Life is a marvelous thing,” he says. “ Espe­ cially when one, like me, comes so close to losing it.”

ANDREW YOUNG, the handsome 45-year- old, who is our man at the United Na­ tions looks like he’s trying to take the title of 
“motor mouth” from dear old Bella Abzug. 
It seems that if Andy puts his foot any further in his mouth, he will have to have it expanded with oral surgery. 
The housewives of Boston and the steel workers of Pittsburgh might feel very remote and sate from this gab-happy man. 
After all, what do the idiotic things that go on in the United 
Nations have to do with the price of fish? 

Big-mouthed 
U.N. envoy should be muzzled 

Well, unfortunately they do when it comes to the very real is­ sue of a man making monkeys out 
(rf the image of the average 
American. 
The fastest gums in the govern­ ment had hardly warmed his seat in the plush surroundings of the 
United Nations when he was off and running. 
First, he outraged sensibilities with his statement that Fidel Cas­ tro's thugs in Africa bring a 
“eel ain stability to Angola.” 
The same man had dramatical­ ly different ideas when U.S. boys were being killed by Communist bullets in Vietnam. He believed we were invaders. But Castro’s gunmen are different. 
Next he accused Britain of hav­ ing “invented racism.” 
Nobody invented racism but if somebody did, I respectfully sug­ gest that Mr. Young should pon­ der the situation of a white man walking through Harlem. 
If racism was invented by a white man, then black men haven’t been far behind in learn­ ing the same cancerous trait. 
Then he tells us that Americans shouldn’t get “all paranoid about a few Communists or even a few thousand Communists in Africa.” 
I know a lot of Chinese. Viet­ namese and Cuban refugees who might sock Mr. Young in the mouth for that kind of idiot blind­ ness. 
Statements like that in a saner world of 2o years ago would have 
Deen regarded as treason if said by a man in the street. And an ap­ pointed official who said them would have been viewed as es­ tranged from sanity. 
If Jimmy Carter thinks he owes a couple of hundred thousand 

 votes to untiring Mr. Young, he should buy him a diamond-stud­ ded muzzle. 
But don’t give him a sensitive job where the eyes of the world are watching him. 
Young’s comments have prompted a non-stop barrage of denials or “clarifications’’ from the White House. 
When Young said that Ameri­ can troops might be used in a 
U.N. peacekeeping force in Rho­ desia, Press Secretary Jody Pow­ ell reacted as if he had been hit by a brick 
“I think he might have been thinking of a hypothetical situa­ tion,” Powell spluttered 
They might just have to estab­ lish a special department in the 
White House to issue such “clar­ ifying” statements after Young opens his mouth. 
Young told a reporter after his appointment to the U.N., “ I al­ ways used to enjoy throwing out ideas on foreign policy, acting like a gadfly, just to stimulate discus­ sion on important issues. 
“Then I got involved with this peanut farmer from Georgia and everyone started to take me.seri- ousiy.” 
Well, I, for one, refuse to take him seriously. And I suspect a good proportion of sane-thinking citizens feel the same way. 
Anyone can say the first thing that comes into fiis head and get a conversation going. But Mr. 
Young is in a position of talking about destinies of nations and peo­ ple's lives. 
Freedom of speech should not, with a U.S. official, be misinter­ preted as freedom to talk like a clown—not when you represent this country. 
Smelly food tan help fat people lose weight 

A DIET of strong-smelling foods can help a fat person lose weight, says a top psychologist. 
Susan Shiffman, of Duke Uni­ versity’s dietary rehabilitation center, said that aroma is the key factor in developing an appealing diet for the overweight. 

“You need an entirely new type of diet that has strong odors— odors that would be too strong for the average person,” she said. 
Dr. Shiffman said most fat peo­ 

 ple have an appreciation of taste and fragrance that is so sensitive they can identify most foods blindfolded. 
In a study, she found that 9o percent of obese people think smell is of primary importance in determining flavor ana taste. 
They also said bland-smelling foods are bland in taste and fla­ vor. 
“If the smell was there, all sub­ jects found the food delicious," she added.

Last Week’s Answer: PEACOCK 

BUCKLED-UP 
SEA TBH TS 
AS SAFE AS 
AIR BAGS 
IF AMERICANS would only buc­ kle their seat belts, they wouldn’t need airbags in their cars, says a new government study. 
The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration round ei­ ther buckled seat belts or manda­ tory’ air bags would have the same results: 
• Lives of 8,35o people a year would be saved; 
• Another 172,ooo would avoid injuries, or have less serious inju­ ries; 
• At least $2,3 billion a year in accident costs would be saved. 
The administration pointed out that the use of heavy airbags would increase national oil con­ sumption from 13.7 to 17.1 million barrels a year. 
The report projected and com­ pared effects of air bags in ail cars with laws requiring seat belts be buckled. 
It assumed mandatory buckling laws would get compliance from 
7o percent of drivers and passen­ gers, This is the rate of compli­ ance in nations having such laws. 
The report was a required pre­ liminary to a decision about air­ bags by U.S. Secretary of Trans­ portation Brock Adams. He will decide by July I whether to re­ quire air bags for all 1981 model cars. 
Neither those for nor against air bags were satisfied with the re­ port. 
Ford Motor Company spokes­ man Mike Davis said: “ There won’t be enough airbags on the road for a long time, even if they are required for 1981 models. 
“ You won’t have IOO percent passive restraints (air bags) for 
IO years.” 
He said Ford would continue to back buckle-up laws in preference to mandatory air bags. 
“ Ford and other automakers have started a program called 
Motorists Information Inc. to get people to use their belts,” he said. 
He noted the report assumed people in cars with air bags would still have to use their lap belts, anyhow. 
An air bag partisan, Brian O’­ 
Neill, vice president of the Insur­ ance Institute for Highway Safety, told THE STAR: 
“There’s a lot of mis-informa- tion about air bags. 
“Passive restraints are de­ signed to operate in frontal crash­ es — representing major crashes that currently produce most seri­ ous and fatal injuries. 
“ In frontal crashes, the air bag works perfectly whether you’re wearing the lap belt or not.” 
“ The fact it would take IO years for every car on the road to"have jussive restraints is the fault of i:he automakers.”________ 
ELEPHANT MYSTERY 
PUZZLES POLICE 
STATE Trooper Charles Barren- tine was sent to investigate re­ ports of an elephant on a highway near Tuscaloosa. Ala., but he found only some hay, sawdust and other debris on the" road. 
Witnesses said a circus truck had run off the road, the driver unloaded the elephant, used the beast to push the truck back on the highway and departed. 

Mae West, 84 at least, still lures young men with famous come-on 

By PIERS AKERMAN 
WHEN THE magnificent Mae West repeated her classic invita­ tion, “Come up and see me sometime,” I jumped at the chance. 
She lives, unbelievably, in the same Los Angeles apartm ent rented for her in 1932 by Paramount Pictures, which lured her west from 
Broadway. 
A bosomy life preserver was named for Mae West during World War 
II. And today, though she’s at least 84 years of age. it s still ob­ v io u s why. 
Armed with two dozen peach roses, I went to her apartment. 
Her longtime bodyguard and companion. Paul Novack, ushered me into a large living room fur­ nished with white and gold an­ tiques. 
Above the deep, white sofa, was placed a framed oil painting of a youthful Mae West titled “ Sex.” 
Two four-foot statues of a naked Mae West stood on the gilt and ivory' piano in a com er of the room. 
Mae — who has just completed making the film Sextette with En­ glish star Timothy Dalton and such guests as Bingo Starr. Keith 
Moon and George Raft — made a grand entrance and immediately began explaining the nude por­ trait. 
It was painted, she explained, by a woman artist in 1933 and is the only painting Mae has ever allowed. 
“ When I came out here from 
Broadway, I was convinced to have that picture done. Of course nobody would sit nude for a male artist then, but this woman I re­ member as F A. Kinzel talked me into it.” 
Her complexion is still peach- 
* like, her hands are smooth and her conversation is wry and rele­ vant. 
Contrary to gossip. Mae is al­ ert, aware and intelligent. She is the only woman ever to write and star in her own plays and movies with the stipulation none of her work would De changed. 

“ I have written my own lines in my plays, films right back to vaudeville,” she said. 
“Sylvester Stallone (who wrote and starred in Rocky> is getting acclaimed now for something I’ve been doing all my life." 
Mae believes strongly in parap- 

 p sychology and the occult. She holds monthly seances during which her friends send personal messages to their deceased lovers and make inquiries about current friends, the stock market and the race track. 
She has never permitted anoth­ er woman to have equal billing in one of her movies. 
“ I wrote every line I ever spoke and the other cast lines were for men,” she said. “ Basically, all my movies have been vehicles for myself." 
But she has helped many men during her career, including 
George Raft and her most famous 
» find, Cary Grant. 
“ I was sitting in my office at 
Paramount discussing a possible leading man for the film. She 
Done Him Wrong, when I saw this guy walk around the parking lot,” she recalled. 
“ He was the best looking big boy in Hollywood. I said: i f he can talk, I ii take him .” 
Mae’s new find is Timothy Dal­ ton and she gives him the same 

* buildup she once gave Grant. She claims he is as energetic and a source of as much inspiration as 
Grant was. 

Ringo Starr gets the notorious Mae West treatment in their new film, Sextette.

 her waist, attributes her vitality and beauty to a strict, healthy and unalterable routine. 
She eats only organic foods bought at one of the health stores near her home. She works out each morning with barbells and an exercise bicycle. 
She also walks on Santa Monica beach, near one of her other resi­ dences, and her ranch outside Los 
Angeles where her sister Bever­ ley lives. 
Her unlisted telephones stay shut off until at least noon every day. They are switched on again when she arises in the early after­ noon. She doesn’t get to bed until 
2 or 3 a m. 
Mac has never tasted alcohol or smoked. The langorous cocktails and nonchalant cigarettes of her films were props. 
She drinks only distilled water in her coffee and tea and by itself, in an old-fashioned glass. Even her soups are made with it. 
Mae told me she was raised on 
Willoughby Avenue in Brooklyn, 
N.Y., among macho men. Her fa­ ther owned his own detective agency and worked out in a base­ ment gymnasium daily. 

“ Look,” she said, bulging the biceps in her right arm. “ I am still as fit as I was when I used to watch my father. 

“ I introduced muscle men to movies years ago and I guess you far

 don’t eat much candy. I eat high protein foods like steak, fish, fowl and salads.” 
To preserve her complexion, 
Mae rubs cocoa butter and a little lanolin over her face, arm s and breasts each night. 
“ I haven’t changed much at all since 1934,” she said. 
“ I have had to write my own scripts and I’ve never had time to think of anything but my next project. 
•Currently 
I am writing a screenplay from my novel Plea- 

 are you just glad to see m e?” 
She said an old friend, an as­ sistant district attorney in Los An­ geles in the 3os, had meant to meet her as she stepped of! the train from New York at Union 
Station. 
Unable to make the appoint­ ment he sent two deputies with the instructions: “Give Mae a hug, a kiss and a squeeze from me.” 
A tall, muscled individual stepped forward at the station, ex­ plained his instructions, and pro­ ceeded to do as he’d been told. 
He blushed to his hairline as 
Mae delivered her sexiest line. 
For the premiere of Sextette 
Mae intends to give a Hollywood party. Timothy Dalton will possi­ bly attend a premiere party in 
London without her. 
“ I’m too busy to leave town. 
I’ve too many projects going, ifs the only way I remain vital,” Mae said. 
“ But,” she added, “ come up and see me anytime — the soon­ er, the better.” 

 sure Man.” 
In fact. Mae does not write a line. 
She dictates to a secretary who cannot type or take shorthand but who is able to recall about 75 per­ cent of what he has heard. 
“ I knew I would be a star from the time I was old enough to think,” she said. “ I wouldn’t go to a store. I would not even carry a parcel unless it was wrapped with silk.” 
I asked her if her most famous lines were made up or taken from her personal experience. 
“ Everything I said was my own. When I said ‘Look me over, but don’t try to reform m e’ to 
Cary Grant," I was relating to something that happened in my life. 
“ I also took the line ‘Come up and see me sometime’ from life.” 
Mae’s most notorious routine used the line “ Is that your gun or

And she charged $12S for con­ sultations. She wrote: “ I saw five of your patients while I was wait­ ing. Two I cured completely.

Two who 
2oopounds fell diet sotrets 

TWO young men who lost a total of 2oo pounds have started their own national organization to pro­ mote health and vitality. 
Franklin Melniek and Arthur 
Glass are the founder of Diet Ex­ po, a new show they call “a world’s fair of diet and nutrition.” 
The four-day exhibition opened in New York last month, and now it is moving to other cities around the country. 
Melniek, 3o, said he started get­ ting fat at age 8. By the time he was 17 he weighed 265 pounds. 
But for the last five years, he has been holding at 153 pounds. 
His partner, Arthur Glass, de­ scribed himself as one of those people who was always gaining and losing 25 pounds His top was 
195, but now ne has stabilized at around 168. 
“I eat a lot (rf high protein foods instead,” said Glass. “ I’ll have an egg salad sandwich or a tuna salad on whole grain bread. 
I don’t use any white flour or sug­ ar.” 
Melniek said he is “mainly ve­ getarian.” He added: 
“ I like brown rice and sprouts. You can buy a pound of sprouts for $1 ami it makes 8 to IO pounds of live food. I cook them or eat them raw.” 
Both agree that mental atti­ tude plays a vital role in diet­ ing. They practice meditation and yoga which, they say, helps them to keep healthy mentally and physically.

Steve McQueen 

By JOHN ARGYLE 
ALI MAC GRAW this week hit back at rumors that her superstar husband, 
Steve McQueen, is opposed to her mak­ ing a comback in movies. 
The vivacious actress who burst onto the screen in hits like Love Story and Goodbye 
Columbus five years ago, said she gave up her movie career when she married Steve 
“because he’s used to the company of his woman, and I wanted to give him that.” 
But now she has had her long dark tresses cropped and is returning to the screen in Con­ voy, based on the CB radio hit song. 
And she said she is getting strong support from husband Steve 
Ali left movies when sne married to make a home for Steve and her six-year-old son Josh, by her previous marriage to producer Bob 
Evans. But even her self-imposed exile didn’t stop movie offers from coming in. 

 rows, soys 

“I’ve turned them all down,” she said this week from her Malibu home. “It wasn’t a question of Steve saying no. Steve and I both discussed the scripts and agreed that none of them were worthwhile. 
“Perhaps we weren’t quite ready for it yet either. Either one of us, I mean. I know at least I wasn’t. But I am now.” 
“I wanted to stay at home for those five years—for Josh and for Steve. But now my son is getting older. He’s well protected and well loved. 
“There’s space for me to work and Tm get­ ting restless. And it wouldn’t do any good for 
Steve and me, or our marriage, if I stayed at home any more. 
“We have talked about it frankly to each

 other and resolved the situation.” 
Ali admitted that she and Steve had a blaz­ ing row when she told him she wanted to work again. 
“He knows I love him but he didn’t want me to go back to movies,” she said. “We had a fight. A dilly. 
“ It happened when a script came to me be fore Convoy and I was feeling ready to work again. We talked about it for the first time and he didn’t react too well. I think he felt caught off-guard by it all—as if I hadn’t told him something or not warned him. 
“As a result he just disappeared from the house for a week and went off into the desert. 
When I tried to reach him, I couldn’t. I want­ ed to tell him that I wouldn’t do it. 
“ But when he came back in through the door a week later with one of his bikes he just said: ‘You were right.’ And that was it. We’ve agreed ever since. 
“I think I used to resent it when Steve would take off for four or five days into the desert with his bikes but I don’t anymore. He has to get away from time to time.” 
Asked about their separations when Steve moves occasionally into a suite at the Beverly 
Hills hotel, Ali said: “ He can’t work on scripts with Josh and I around, so he moves in mere to get his work done. 
“If we had a fight he would never move out. Tliis house is ours and we fight well in it. 
“The last time we had one Steve went to his den and stayed there for three days. The maid served us separate meals and Josh car­ ried messages between us. 
Ali said she and Steve were going to sur­ prise Hollywood cycnics who say a working couple can never stay together. “ I plan to be 
Mrs. McQueen for a long time,” she added. 

How to help your child learn 

PARENTS determine wheth­ er their children are good students, says an expert on education. 
Barbara S. Kuchen, profes­ sor of early childhood educa­ tion at Chicago State Univer­ sity, said many of a child’s attitudes about learning are already set by the time he en­ ters school. 
And once he is in school, hsi parents continue to be his chief teachers, she told THE 
STAR. 
Dr. 
Kuchen listed these ways parents can help their 

 child to learn more: 
• Encourage him, even when he falters. 
A child should never be punished, or made to feel a parent doesn’t approve of him, because he can’t master a particular 3S" signment. Usually, the as­ signment is simply beyond his current capability. Push­ ing him past his limit makes 
Mm frustrated. 
• Set realistic learning goals. Trying for goals that

An average call in Maine lasts four minutes and 2o seconds. 
In most other states the calls are at least IO percent longer. 

 are too high hurts the child’s confidence. 
• Don’t require too much study. In the early years,' especially, this slows learn­ ing down. First and second graders should study no long­ er than 15 minutes a day. 
• Be careful in assessing ability and interests. Parents’ interests should not be im­ posed on cMldren. Children’s abilities should not be mea­ sured against their parents.’ 
• Make homework inter­ esting. Parents can help the cMld learn by teaching him to relate his assignments to his everyday life. 
• Don’t over-emphasize learning. Show approval of what your child accomplishes even when he doesn’t meet your expectations. The feel­ ing that grades are every­ thing discourages and frus­ trates him if he falls short. 

Ali clings to Steve’s arm as he signs an autograph for a fan: They had a “dilly of a fight*' when she broke the news that she wanted to make a comback in movies.
