 plot alleged 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
A secret inform ant has claimed knowledge and offered evidence of an alleged police and FBI plot to kill Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr., according to 
Rep. Gene Snyder of Kentucky, a member of the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations. 

The inform ant, whoso nam e was not rev ealed , c la im e d th e plot involved several FBI agents. N am e and location of the police d e p a rtm e n t w ere being withheld by Rep. Snyder. 
Snyder said he m et the m an “ face to face” and that “ he appeared to be r a ­ tional. a logical kind of m a n .” 
Snyder said he got a letter from the man and listened to a tape the m an said he m ade of the alleged assassin a­ tion plot. S n y d e r r e f u s e d to sa y whether the m an or the police d e p a rt­ ment involved were in Kentucky. 
Asked why the m an contacted him and let him listen to a copy of the tape recording, Snyder said, “ He may have just been looking for so m eo ne w ith nerve, a fighter." 
Snyder read part of the letter and used the word “ blank” w here the m an had used names.

Semaan may get 
W est’s millions 

By SARA MARTINEZ 
San Antonio attorney Fred 
Semaan revealed Saturday he is the major beneficiary of what he believes is the most recent will of the late Sandra Ilene West. 

P o lice found th e 37-year-old M rs. 
W est d e a d in h e r p a la t ia l B ev e rly 
Hills, Calif., home M arch IO. A ruling is pending in the death. 
Some estim ates have placed value of her estate as high as $5 million. 

S e m a a n , d e s c r ib e d by a fa m ily friend as "m o re like a fa th er" to Mrs 
West, has been the fam ily’s attorney for m ore than 2o years. He said he had the will, dated Nov. 23, 1976, in his office safe. 
Earlier will 

S atu rday Sem aan vowed to wage a legal battle against an earlier will filed for probate in California last week. It was alleg ed ly h a n d w ritte n by M rs 
West in 1972 and contains a num ber of unusual provisions. 
Among those provisions in the al­ leged 1972 will is a request that Mrs 
West be buried "next to my husband in my lace nightgown and in my F errari with the seat slanted com fortably." 
Her late husband. San Antonio native 
Ike West J r ., is buried in the Alamo 
Masonic C em etery at North Pine and 
East C om m erce streets. 
S em aan insisted S atu rd ay th at the latest will was w ritten in his office on 
Nov. 23, 1976. He said it “ doesn’t con­ tain any wild provisions about burying her in a F e rra ri or anything else." 
He added: "T h e will was witnessed by four people, all San Antonians, and will bt' filed in Los Angeles this week 
LII either go or send a representative out there. 
"A t the tim e it (the new will) was signed by her, she m a d e un oral re ­ quest that I see she was buried with a 

 gold chain and cross that her husband gave to her," said Semaan lie said Mrs. West gave no indication during the 1976 signing that there was another will in existence. 
T h e 1976 w ill n a m e s o n e m a jo r beneficiary, S em aan , and two minor beneficiaries. Sem aan said none of the 
West family m e m b e rs were included among beneficiaries. 
T he alleged 1972 will, on the othei hand, leaves the hulk of the estate to 
Sol West III of Comfort He is a brother of Mrs. W est’s late husband, or Mrs. 
West s brother-in-law . 
The 1972 docum ent specifies that to get the money West must c arry out the will s p ro v isio n s, in clu d in g th e c a r burial request. 
Crowley 
West s attorney, A rthur Crowley of 
Los Angeles, said. " I ’ve heard of Mr. 
Sem aan and I un derstand th ere is a second will. 
“ But there is a question about it 
I understand it was m arked void ail over it and that Mr. Semaan is supposed to be the m ajor beneficiary. 
" T h e inform ation we h ave is that such a will was drawn. It was later, at her request, m arked void. 
"H o lo g ra p h ic (h a n d w ritte n ) wills are valid iii California so we decided to go ahead with the funeral services but then delay the interm ent until we get 

 in s tru c tio n s fro m the c o u r t , ’’ said 
Crowley. 
“ I don’t know when we will get those instructions but it looks as if th ere will be a will contest,” said Crowley. 
A probate hearing on the alleged 1972 will has been scheduled for April ll in

 new TOW times SERVICE 
MEXICO CITY - Mexico’s proven oil reserves stand at a staggering 11.1 billion barrels, according to Pemex, the state oil monopoly. 

R e c e n t u n o ff ic ia l e s t i m a t e s had pegged the country’s reserves ut only 
6(1 million barrels. 
During cerem onies m arkin g the 39th an n iv ersary of the nationalization of 
Mexican oil, P e m e x ’s d irec to r-g e n e r­ al, Jo rg e Diaz Serrano, noted that the figure of 11 1 billion barrels does not include known reserves on the contin­ ental shelf off the state of C am peche nor oil and gas fields that are not yet in production. 
Speculation 

Mexico’s oil reserves have been the su b ject of e n o rm o u s sp e cu latio n at home and abroad since rich deposits w ere stru c k in the e a ste rn states of 
C h ia p a s and T a b a s c o in May 1972 
T hese fields now account for 6o per cent of Me xico’s daily oil and liquid gas output of 1,o3o,ooo barrels. 
New hydrocarbon deposits have also been found in the past two years iii the states of V eracru z, T a m u u h p u s and 
Baja California. 
L ast D e c e m b e r, ju st th re e w eeks a fte r P re s id e n t J o s e Lopez P ortillo took office, Pem ex abruptly increased its official reserve estim ate from 6.3 billion barrels to ll billion, although al th e ti m e g o v e r n m e n t o ff ic ia ls d e ­ scribed the new figure as still very conservative. 
A m e ric a n g o v e rn m e n t and oil in ­ 

 dustry experts have indicated private­ ly th at M exico's oil re s e rv e s are at h a s t 6o billion b a rre ls, roughly six times larger than A laska’s North Slope and almost com parable to the reserves of Iran. 

Report 

At present, an A m erican company, 
D eg o ly cr & M a c N a u g h to n Inc., is working with the Mexican Petroleum 
Institu te to produce un independent assessm ent of Mexico’s current oil re- serves. Its report, directed principally at foreign banks that will be asked to finance P e m e x ’s current $15 5 billion investment program , is expected to be 

 ready in May. 
In a speech last Friday, considered to be P e m e x ’s an n u a l r e p o r t, Diaz 
S errano said th a t, with ll 16 billion barrels of reserves, Mexico s reserve production ratio is now a healthy 24.9 years. 

“T his ratio is very high tor a country that, while facing financial problem s, knows thai lls oil reserv -s arc growing very rapidly due to the discovery ol new fields,” hi1 said: “ By having m ore proven re s e rv e s one can and should produce more. One also can and should export more This is lo benefit ration­ ally lull intensely from our n a tu ra l resources "

President Gerald R. Ford was in­ troduced to a m eeting of ski in­ dustry rep rese n tativ es as “ the most famous skier in the world.” 

“ As,every president knows, ski­ ing is a lot like being President of the United States.” Ford said when his turn to speak came. “You start at the top — and after that it's all down hill.” 
Ford stopped off on a trip with 

 his wife and daughter, Susan, from 
Vail, Colo., to their home in Palm 
Springs, Calif. He addressed the annual Ski Industries America SIA trade show Friday. 
Ford then played a round of golf at the Desert Inn Country Club. and the fam ily m e m b e rs were guests of honor at a private dinner and cocktail party in a penthouse suite at Caesars Palace. Then they attended F ra n k S in atra 's early show- in the hotel’s famed Circus

A fo rm e r chef for J a c q u e lin e 
Onassis says he was irritated by her habit of pouring k etch u p on everything he cooked for her. 
But Lutz Phieler said he got his revenge for her alleged lack of appreciation of his cooking by serving her a meal of horsemeat and mushrooms. 
Phieler, who said he was a chef aboard the Onassis yacht form 1989 to 1971, said Mrs Onassis "treated us very arrogantly and was very cool to Mr. Onassis.” 

As Britain’s Queen Elizabeth ll celebrates her silver jubilee, her subjects have been recalling the more hilarious m o m en ts of her reign. 
Here are some of the anecdotes that show the funny side of royalty: 

• One of the more em barrassing moments for the Queen and Prince 
Philip was on a visit to Tonga in 
1953. As the guests of honor at the feast, they had to sit cross-legged on the lawn and eat a suckling pig without plates, knives or forks. 
• On one ceremonial occasion, a portly dignitary who was walking backwards from the Q ueen’s pre­ sence fell over a plant. Another time, a lady curtseyed so low she suddenly fell to the floor and had to be helped to her feet. 
• The Queen doesn’t like host countries to go to great expense when she’s on tour. But in Dunedin, 
New Zealand, local officials had an 

 em barrassing m oment when they used second-hand naval signal flags as part of the royal decorations. One morning when the Queen and the 
Prince went out on their botel balcony to wave to crowds, one of the flags they were confronted with was “ Danger — I am loading ex­ plosives.” 

Carter to ask for 'universal’ vote eligibility 

Q u een Elizabeth ll 

NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - President Carter will ask Congress this week to approve a liberal amendment to the voting laws that would virtually eliminate all re­ gistration req u irem en ts and clear more than 45 million additional Amer­ icans to participate in the 198o presi­ dential and congressional elections. 
The proposal, which is certain to arouse partisan controversy on Capitol 
Hill, is currently called universal re­ gistration. In its simplest terms, it would permit any eligible citizen to vote for federal candidates if he went to the polls on election day with an identification card bearing his name, address and age. 
146 million 
In 1976, about 146 million people were eligible to vote in the national election, but only 99 million of them completed the necessary registration procedures. Of these, about 83 million actually went to the polls in November. 
Carter’s attempt to increase partici­ pation in the electoral process has al­ ready been given top priority by De­ mocratic congressional leaders, but it appears likely to run into strong Re­ publican opposition, based on charges that it could open the door to widespread vote fraud. 
In a message on political legislation scheduled for submission to Congress next week, Carter will also call for the 
.following: 
• The elimination of the electors who cast their states’ votes for presi­ d e n t and vice president, and the sub­ stitution of a system that would more uniformly reflect the popular vote. 

• Establishment of public subsidies for Senate and House candidates in 
1978 to help them meet the cost of their campaigns, patterned after the presi­ dential election funding support sys­ tem used for the first time last year. 
• 
Modifying the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activity by federal employees, to allow for some partied-' potion by them, both as campaigners and candidates. 
The White House proposal for uni­ versal registration, according to well­ placed officials, is based on statutes now in effect in Minnesota and Wis­ consin. These allow anyone to register at the polls on election day by pre­ senting a valid d river's license, the equivalent identification card for non­ drivers or another acceptable form of identification. 
Unidentified 
In addition, both states permit an otherwise unidentified person to vote if he is vouched for by someone already registered in the same precinct. In 
Minnesota, such a neighbor must swear to the identification. Both states req u ire a sh o rt re sid e n c e period. 
Minnesota requires 2o days and Wis­ consin IO. 
Congress could impose such a regis­ tration system on the states with re­ spect to federal elections — for presi­ dent, sen ato rs and representatives. 
The states could retain more restric­ tive requirem ents in voting for slate office, but this would almost certainly be unpopular with the electorate. 
The President was understood to fa­ vor federal aid to states to meet the additional costs of registration per- 
Reporters’ series fuels flames 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

The first seven install­ ments of a lengthy series on organized crim e in 
Arizona have blended new information along with old in complicated reports on the financial and social relationships of Sen. Barry Coldwater and other well-known politicians and business­ men. 
Printed accounts of the series, which runs 1oo,ooo words in all. present a m assive collection of names, dates and places figuring in in tricate stock, land and other bu­ siness deals, mainly in 
Arizona and Nevada. It also details a web of 

 social relationships bringing together busin­ essmen, celebrities, the sports world, unions and gangsters. 
Links 

For the most part, the published accounts so far have not alleged any new crim es. R ath er, they present a p icture of well-known business and political leaders dealing with people who are linked — sometimes in­ directly — to organized crime and who are ther­ efore accused of condon­ ing the m o b sters’ p re ­ sence in Arizona. 
Em ployes of 24 new ­ spapers and broadcast outlets worked on the 

 six-month project spon­ sored by Investigative 
Reporters and Editors, 
Inc. The effort was start­ ed after Arizona Repub­ lic reporter Don Bulies was m urdered while working on a story about land fraud. 
Reaction to the reports varied. Some of those named attacked the stor­ ies as lies. Among jour­ nalists, it seemed certain that the effort would remain a source of con­ troversy, both because of the unusual cooperative nature of the project in which some newspapers declined to participate and because of the length and complexity of the re­ sults

The 23-part series was released to participants for use starting last Sun­ day. 
Some of the p articipants, including the Arizona Star, started it on schedule; oth ers, including the Milwaukee 
Jo u rn a l, delayed the stories to allow time for editing; and a few n ew sp a p ers and one broadcaster, KGUN-TV of Tucson, have not used any of the series so far. 
Some participants have used only part of the series. 
Some of the inform a­ tion in published a c ­ counts has already been reported in print. Anth­ ony Insolia, m anaging editor of Newsday, the 

Long Island newspaper, and story editor for the 
IRE project, said: “ It’s obvious, some of it’s old. 
But ifs never been put together in this way and there’s additional infor­ mation... 
“There’s a lot more to the series. When you take the series in a total con­ text, I think it explains and backs up what our lead story said: That 
Arizona is a state that has a lot of trouble.”

Sen. Coldwater and his brother Robert, the focus of m any of the stories appearing in print, den­ ounced the series. The

“ None of my friends will pay any at­ tention to it.”

Among the reports that were old was a statement in the fourth part of the se rie s that Sen. C old­ water had written a letter su p p o rtin g a land scheme launched by con­ victed extortionist and land promoter Ned War­ ren Sr. The story was printed in the Arizona

Monday. 
Plane ride 
The sen ato r said a report of his giving a plane ride to Willie Bioff, described as a racketeer, had been p rin te d two decades ago. He con­ firm ed that he had a c ­ cepted a $5,ooo contribu­ tion from Bioff for his first Senate campaign in 
1952, but said he had known the man under the name Willie Nelson and did not find out his true identity until after the election. Bioff was m ur­ dered in 1955, 
Among the new allega­ tions in p ublished a c ­ counts of the series: 
• Tuesday’s statement that Harry Rosenzweig, former Arizona R epub­ 

 lican ch airm an , “ has nurtured prostitution and gambling in Phoenix for years.” Rosenzweig has declined to comment on the stories, pending con­ sultation with legal counsel, but Barry Cold­ water labeled this report 
“ another lie.” 

D iscussing the T u e s ­ day story, an A rizona 
Republic rep o rter and columnist said: “That’s a real bombshell, although we’ve had some informa­ tion going back th re e years pointing to that ... 
The report nails down locations and specifics.” 
• Monday’s report that the Valley National Bank of which Robert C o ld ­ water is a director loaned money to the m ob-con­ nected Flamingo Hotel. 
Robert said that as far as he knew, “ the bank never m ade a loan to the 
F lam ingo 
Hotel as such.” Any loan, he said, would have gone to the late Del Webb, the con­ tractor. 
• The statem en t on 
Monday that Barry and 
Robert Coldwater were friendly with C larence 
“ M ike" Newman, d e ­ scribed as running a gam bling operation in 
Phoenix some years ago. 
Robert said he did place bets on football g am es with Newman — “ a local fellow who went to school here” — but denied that the bets were in the thousands of dollars as reported. 
Congo head assassinated 

KINSHASA, 
Zaire 
(AP) — An U -m em ber military committee has assu m ed power in the 
People’s Republic of the 
Congo following the as­ sassination of President 
M arten Ngouabi, the 
Congo radio reported 
Saturday. 
Radio 
B razzaville, m onitored here, said 
Ngouabi was fatally shot 
Friday by a Capt. Barth* eiemy Kikadidi, who led an “ imperialist suicide commando” squad in at­ tacking the 39-year-old president at army head­ quarters. 
The radio said the at­ tackers escaped and ap­ pealed to the whole na­ tion to find them. It said 
Ngouabi was shot in the jaw and died “ with a gun in his hand ” 
Charges 
The assassination fol­ lowed recent charges by officials of the impover­ ished 
West 
African country that imperialist sab o teu rs w ere trying 
“ to bring about changes in o rien tatio n " among leftist countries on the continent. 
In a statBjnent March

T h y ster 
T chicaya, a high Con­ golese official, referred to a “ difficult aud dan­ gerous" internal situ a­ tion iii bis country which 

 he said w as brought about by a “ vast im pe­ rialist sabotage plan.” 

Radio Brazzaville said the ruling committee would “ assure the safety of the people and the revolution, m an ag e af­ fairs of state and prepare for the state funeral” of 
Ngouabi. 

The co m m ittee a n ­ nounced a dusk-to-dawn curfew nationw ide, closed the c o u n try ’s borders until further no­ tice, banned meetings of m ore than five people and decreed a m o n th ­ long period of mourning.

 sonnel at the polls. A sta te th at adopted u n i­ versal registration at the state level would become eligible for additional aid under the Carter propo­ sal. 
States would be given som e flexibility in a d ­ m in is te rin g the program, it was learned, such as estab lish in g a so m e w h at s tr ic te r s c re e n in g system for major urban areas where vote fraud is regarded as m ore likely to occur in large enough numbers to affect the outcome of a close election. 

Postcards 

Last August, at the re­ quest of Carter, then the 
Democratic presidential nom inee, the House of 
R e p re se n ta tiv e s a p ­ proved a national system of postcard registration for voting in federal elections. The legislation never cleared the Senate, however, largely due to time pressures. 
Republicans have con­ sistently attacked post­ card registration as sub­ ject to flagrant m isuse and virtually impossible to police. They are ex ­ pected to make the sam e argument even more for­ cibly against the admin­ istration’s universal re ­ gistration plan. 

Although there is no g u a ra n te e th a t highly sim plified reg istratio n would increase voting p a rtic ip a tio n , a 
1976 study by two political scientists at the Univer­ sity of California. Berke­ ley, pred icted that n a ­ tional turnout would rise by about IO per cent if all s ta te s adopted voting laws like those in Minne­ sota and Wisconsin. 

According to Steven J. 
R osenstone and R a y ­ mond E. Wolfinger, who analyzed som e 9o,ooo ce n su s b u rea u v o ter interview s, the larg est increase in participation would com e am ong blacks, Southerners and people with little formal education, groups which are traditionally regard­ ed as tending to vote De­ mocratic. 

In the 1976 election, according to the Census 
B u rea u , only 59.2 p e r cent of the voting-age population cast ballots, co n tin u in g a steady downward trend from 63 per cent in 1972, 67.8 per cent in 1968 and 69.3 per cent in 1964. 

Coup 

Ngouabi seized power in a military coup Aug. 3, 
1968, and was formally named chief of state in 
J a n u a ry 1969. The fol­ lowing December he pro­ claim ed a 
“ peo p le’s republic” and steered the country on a leftist course. 

The Congo Republic is located in West Africa along an B airn ie strip of territory,north of Zaire. 
It produces tobacco, sugar, coffee and other a g ric u ltu ra l p roducts, and is one of A frica’s poorest countries.

PAUL 
Motives are clear in police politics— * 

THOMPSON 

Mayor 
Lila 
Cockrell pro­ nounces herself “ not mad, just puzzled” as to why the San An­ tonio Police Assn. has refused to endorse her for reelection April 
2 . 

Thr endorsement went to John J Monfrey. well heeled Falstaff-Pcarl beer distributor waging a major campaign for Mrs. Cockrell’s job. 
When the incumbent mayor discussed that rousing new development over the weekend, there were no tears in her eyes, only a strange cold look. 
“ I feel totally let down,” were the mayor’s first words in her City Hall office. 
“ Why. right here on the wall hangs a cer­ 

 tificate stating that I am an ‘honorary member of the 
San 
Antonio 
Police 
Officers Assn.’ I thought so much of it I had it encased, at my own expense, in a w ide golden frame. 
“ You might even call it the centerpiece of my wall display. And now this.” 

Mayor Cockrell went on: 

“ During my ll years in public life. I have been a tough, consistent supporter of every proper police cause, better pay, improved working renditions, more manpower and the best in up-to-the-minute equipment. 

“ I have been a champion of law and order straight across the board. 

“ In view of that record, I can only assume that police or at least the force’s political arm 
— oppose me now because of my stand against the unlimited cash for sick leave’ bill pushed through the legislature two years ago.” 
The mayor was referring to Sen. Frank 

Lombardino’s bill that counts three weeks sick leave per year to city police and firemen as money they have coming whether they’re sick or not. City finance officials concur that unless this bill is repealed, tho city ad valor­ em tax rate must undergo a significant hike. 

Says Mayor Cockrell: "I opposed the bill for one good and sufficient reason: San Antonio can’t afford it.” 

She also took note that with those millions upon millions of dollars going to police and firemen over the years in sick leave cash, the 
City Council would face a hard two-way al­ ternative: “ Either discriminate against all the other thousands of municipal employes, or grant them commensurate benefits at ruinous cost to taxpayers.” 
The mayor said she felt called upon there­ fore to fight for repeal of the Lombardino bill in an open, direct and forceful way, including an appearance in Austin before legislators with power of life or death over repeal. 
“ Three other council members went up 

 there with me in behalf of city taxpayers — 
Phil Pyndus, Glen Hartman and Al Rohde,” she continued. 
“ I ani not going to comment one way or another on why the five remaining council members did not accompany us. 
“ But I will say this: Councilmen Pyndus, 
Hartman and Rohde ALSO failed to draw endorsement of the San Antonio Police Assn. in their races for reelection. 

“And I consider that most significant right on its face." 

Asked if she thought some kind of "deal" might have been struck between the Police 
Assn. and City Council candidates who re-* eeived its blessing, including Monfrey. Mayor 
Cockrell refused comment. 
She did say that none of her remarks to this column were intended bi imply, directly or indirectly, wrongdoing “ on the part of any­ body at all.” 
Candidate Monfrey, reached at his down­ town office Saturday afternoon, said no one 

 from the police association “ so much as talked ‘deal’ with me." 
✓ 
He added: “ They asked me a whole bunch 
■of questions and I answered right down the line. One was about the gambling hotel I 
• owned in Reno, Nev., for six weeks many years ago. I told them I got rid of the thing and have been in no form of gambling opera­ tion since them.” 

To a question on whether he would push for unlimited sick pay for police and firemen if elected mayor. Monfrey issued a flat no. 

“ My ow n employes get one day of sick leave per month. If they don’t use it, it s gone at the end of each year. As a businessman, I ’d have to be against the idea of paying people for not being sick on the job.” said Monfrey. 

"So the idea of me, as mayor, picking up on a package calling for unlimited sick leave pay to any group of city employes is ridiculous. 

“ Quite simply and plainly put, the city can’t afford it." 
New flood project on 
W est Side is dedicated 

By ALAN BA ILEY 

Apache Creek project, a $17 m illion storm drainage and 
West Side beautification pro­ gram, was formally dedicated in ceremonies Saturday. 

“ This is not just a drainage channel, but a beautiful new waterway in San 
Antonio for us to enjoy," said Mayor 
Lila C ockrell 
“ This was one project that was non-controversial. Something had to be done about flooding and to end the constant nightmares. 
Model cities 
“ The completion of this project brings us safety and a peace of mind. 
Today makes the years of planning and work all worthwhile.” 
The Apache (’reek project, which had been discussed for many years, finally received the go-ahead in the late lipids when Model C ities, a feder­ ally funded renewal program, started in San Antonio. 

M AYBE a fte r a pause for refresh m en t and a little coaching things will get better on the next try. Try an­ other washer. M ary. 

Mayor Cockrell expressed thanks lo 
U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, who pushed the council into applying for a 
Model C ities grant in the late 196os. 
Roy Montez, former director of Mo­ del Cities, acted as master of cere­ monies and gave a brief history of the 
Apache Creek project and the Model 
Cities program, which expired a cou­ ple of years ago. 
Talks 
Representatives of other govern­ mental agencies also gave brief talks at the dedication ceremonies next to 
Klinendorf Lake, near West Commerce and 24th streets. 
These included, Jam es Byam, area deputy director of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development; Lt. 
Col. Harvey D. Hodges, deputy district engineer. U .S. Corps of Engineers; 
Barbara Banker, chairman of the San 
Antonio Development Agency, and 
Paul Herder, chairman of San Antonio 
River Authority. 
The project involved extensive rede­ velopment of the river channel both above and below Elmendorf Lake for a three-mile section from Gen. McMul­ len Drive to Trinity Street. 
Besides the stream widening, the area includes a landscaped parkway with picnic areas, sports fields and courts, pedestrian bridges and walkways.

San Antonio will wither on the vine unless answers start com­ ing soon to the future of the city’s water supply, U.S. Rep. 
Henry Gonzalez said Saturday. . 
Gonzalez released a five-page state­ ment on Sun Antonio’s future water supply, but the statement m ainly traced the* history of the water issue. 
“San Antonio was founded because it had a ready source of pure water It is in existence because it has water. It can continue to exist and grow only if it has water." said the congressman. 

Aquifer limit 

The congressman noted San Antonio has lived off the Edwards aquifer for 
258 years 
“ We have lust about reached its li­ mit. and we are going to have to help the aquifer out. We have to protect it and we have to supplement it, 
“ If we have a realistic attitude, ut ought to ask every C ity Council candi­ date what they are going lo do aboul securing a safe arid reliable long-rangi water supply for San Antonio. 
“ And we should not settle for dreams: We should demand firm and realistic action The dreaming has been going on for better than twit decades, and we can’t afford it any longer.” said Gonzalez. 

Planning 

The congressman noted plans would have to start now because it takes a long tim e to build a surface water source. 
Citing the proposed Cibolo surface water reservoir. Gonzalez said if the council started now, the city would be lucky to ha\e it in operation by 1985 
* We are living on the thin edge of danger. And yet for decades San An­ tonio has dont* literally nothing lo help itself. 
’’ lf we have inadequate water supplies, we cannot grow lf our supplies begin to diminish, as well they might, the city will simply start dx mg on the vine,” said the congress­ man

LUCKENBACH — No dirt-daubers showed up in Luckenbach Saturday hut thousands of people did. 
All were waiting for the mythical annual return of the dirt-daubers to their summer home in Luckenbach 
The population of the Hill Country town was expanded by folks from a s far away as from Albany. N Y 
Music, beer and good times flowed as thousands of people awaited the annual return of the wasp-like daubers. 
Some people reported the sight of 
Picasso mud-dauber, creator of mud- dauber art. No verification could be made however. 
The sweet sm ell of m arijuana mingled with beer to fill the South 
Texas air as crowds filled the make­ shift stage area to listen to the dirt- dauber song contest 
Kent Finlay, a San Marcos bar owner, lost the contest. Ills losing composition was “ When the dirt- daubers return to Luckenbach.” 
His prize for losing the contest is a one-way tic ket to Buffalo, N Y next 
January 
“ I ’m prouder of tills l o s s than ans other I ve ever had." said the boarded 
Finlay 
Leftovers from the 1976 Bicentennial were oil sale. 
Ten fier cent of the proceeds went to the Hondo Crouch “ I told you so” 

 memorial fund 
Those proceeds will go to erect a statue to Crouch, the former mayor of 
Luckenbach who died last year. 
Items on sale included such items as glowing frisbees and red, white, and blue license plate holders 
, 
Also on exhibit and sail* were exam­ ples of mud-dauber sculpture 
Luckenbach was the site of the na­ tion’s first non-buycentennial celebra­ tion last year The half dozen weath­ ered buildings making up Luckenbach are about 35 miles north of Boerne. 

Luckenbach publicist Jack Harmon said “ As the swallows return yearly to 
Capistrano, Calif., so must the dirt- daubers return to Luckenbach." 
Kathy Morgan. First Lady of Luck­ enbach, said there would also bt* a moseying contest and a falling down contest to celebrate the dirt-daubers return. 
" I just want everyone to have a good time and watch for those dirt- daubers," she said. 
The crowd between beers would chant, "Come little daubers, conic.” 

Ray Hill, a reporter for the Buffalo 
(New Y o rk ) Evening News. said 
Luckenbach is "a little* tnt of Mary 
Poppins, Dogpaleh, and Woodstock ” 
Buffalo has been named sister city to 
Luckenbach 
"Last night there were five mc bes of snow i ii Buffalo and It was 39 degrees. 
I ii inst as m m iii stay iii Luckenbac h,”

 tired he contacted who he says is 
James E a rl Kay’s attorney. ...” 
Hay is serving 99 years in prison for the assassinaton of the civil rights leader slain in Memphis, Tem)., in 
1988. 
Snyder said the former policeman claimed he was offered $588,(MHI on two occasions to kill King 
Richard A. Sprague, the Philadel­ phia attorney who is chief counsel for the assassinations committee, con­ firmed Snyder had turned over mate­ rial containing the allegation. 
Referred 
‘‘The matter you refer to has been referred to the committee and is under investigation,” Sprague said. 
The former policeman, Snyder said, tried to turn over a tape recording of the alleged $5o8,888 offer to Ray s at­ torneys but finally was asked by one of the attorneys’ investigators “ where he planned to hide if he tried to do anyth­ ing with the tape.” 
Snyder said he has discussed the allegation with Rep. Samuel L. Devine of Ohio, the ranking minority member of the committee. Devine, a former 
F B I agent, checked into the man s background and found him to be a 
“ solid citizen,” Snyder said. 

Snyder said the man told him the offers for him to kill King were made in his automobile, where he had a tape recorder. Snyder quoted the man as saying he had two tapes, one of which was either stolen or lost. The other tape was turned over to the committee, 
Snyder said. 
Listened 
Snyder said he listened to a copy of that tape. 
“ Most of it was inaudible to me,” he said. “ I could make out a little I made out enough to believe and ascertain that a discussion was being had about 
King and money, but I didn’t even lis­ ten to all of it.” 
Snyder said he wants the allegation to be thoroughly investigated "and this guy ought to be protected from any problems. If it is inaccurate, then those people w ho he names need to be protected. He names three alleged F B I agents, four or five m embers, prominent members at the time, of a police department.” 
The man has been interviewed by the com m ittee’s investigative staff, 
Snyder said 
Snyder said he received the letter from the man on Feb. 28. 
“ I don’t know if it is valid,” he said. 
“ It is up to the committee to inves­ tigate it.’’

Fire may be arson 

By CECIL CLIFT 
A vengeful arsonist may have set a $148,o88 three-alarm blaze that destroyed a far West Side business complex Satur­ day afternoon, police said. 
Fire fighters uperit 46 minutes bringing the blaze at the complex in the 75o8 block of Mar- baeh Road under control. 
The 5o firemen were hampered by thick clouds of billowing smoke that shot hundreds of feet into the air. The only injury re­ corded was to F ire Lt. 
Vernon Mangold w ho was treated at the scene by 

E M S technicians for a burn on his neck. 
The blaze apparently started in a vacant rear storage room of the mas­ sive one-story brick and wood structure, accord­ ing to Asst. F ire C'hief 
.limmy Salazar. 
Threat 

Mrs. 
Margaret 
Mc­ 
Cabe, operator of a lounge in the center of the structure, .told arson investigators a man had threatened two weeks ago to burn the place down after being ordered to leave following a distur­ bance.

Dispensing of drugs by optom etrists opposed 

The Texas Ophthalmo­ logical Assn. opposes a proposed stale law which would allow non-medi- cally trained optome­ trists to adm inister drugs. 
TOA President Charles 
E. Russo testified before the House Health and 
Welfare Committee last week that dilation drops and other drugs are po­ tentially too dangerous to be used except under close medical scrutiny. 
The committee is con­ sidering the 
Texas 
Optometry Act, which would authorize optome­ trists without medical training to administei such drugs. Dr. Russo said 
The bill is also opposed by the Texas M edical 
Assn., the executive fa­ culty of the Baxter Col­ lege of Medicine and the adm inistrative faculty groups from the Univer­ sity of Texas Health 
Si lence Centers at Hous­ ton, Galveston and San 
Antonio. 
Dr. Russe testified that 
98 per cent of optbalmo- legists responding to a 
TOA survey reported in­ stances of glaucom a caused by dilating drops. 

“ These drugs ean cause adverse reactions requiring immediate at­ tention of doctors,” Dr. 
Russe said. 

‘ i n addition to acute narrow angle glaucoma, the drugs in question can also cause such hyper­ sensitivity reactions such as cardiac arrest.” 

Testimony against the proposed bill emphasized that while optometrists are well trained to pre­ pare lenses and fit glasses, only ophthalmo­ logists have the training abd clinical experience to treat eye disease and problems arising from drug side effects.

McCabe told investiga­ tors 
Police reportedly were following up on leads to the man s identity and whereabouts late 
Sat­ urday. 
Mrs Met abe and two customers were the only occupants in the com ­ plex, which also includes a Mexican restaurant and a vacant business. 
“ We were all sitting insid e,” Mrs. McCabe said, “ when all of a sud­ den the owner’s wife runs in from her ear in the parking lot and says: 
‘Get out of the build­ ing!” ’ 
The owner’s wife had seen the smoke from her home nearby, police were told. 
Field 

Mrs. McCabe said her first reaction was that the ow ner’s wife was talking about an adjacent field burning, since chil­ dren have often set grass tires in the area. 
‘But I went to go into the storeroom, and when 

I got there, I could see from a window the room was filled with smoke.” 
She said that while 
Mrs. .lack Reyes, the owner s wife, grabbed the cash and records from the register, she attempted to telephone her mother but the blaze soon forced her to flee.

Bell official hits vote on fee 

A Senate vote to deny a charge for directory as­ sistance is a vote against the pocketbooks of 95 per cent of the telephone customers, the Texas vice president of South­ western Bell said iii a news release here. 

“ Senators realize the 
Public Utility Commis­ sion must consider in­ creased local rates to ba­ lance the revenue loss and expense savings represented by directory assistance charging,” 
Doyle E Rogers said.

 to outlaw the charge. 
Rogers said the bill was voted out of com­ mittee after little consideration and with­ out proper study or re­ gard for the impact on customers. 

Commitment 

He added some sena­ tors would vote for pas­ sage of the bill because they made a commitment lo labor 
“ We don’t know what the House w ill do, but that isn t the point,” 
Rogers said. “ The Senate should consider the bill on its merits, not on the basis of pleasing labor." 
Few er than 288 tem ­ porary people lost their jobs “ and they knew when they were hired I 
I that their jobs were not permanent, No perman- J out employes lost jobs,” 
Rogers said. 
“ Who i s t o regulate I

I formed to do that job,” 
Rogers said of the at least 2o bills proposed to tell the commissio what j to do about telephone

"Is the commission to he punished if it gives 
Southwestern Bell a fair hearing, as required by j law'*” Rogers asked

"Not only no we save . customers money with I directory assistance I charging by placing the costs on the few who I generate the costs, hut I we’ve turned the escalat­ ing trend of calls around j 
"W e ’re not now forced j to spend m illions each j year for more and more I 
[directory assistance equipment .. 
“ I feel most strongly that the Senate should defer further, action until its members have had time to conduct proper 
I studies and to consider the cost to our customers 
— their constituents — tf directory assistance charging is outlawed," 
Rogers said.

Great gums! I t’s super-sweetener 

IQ S ANGELES TIMES SERVICE 

■PASADENA, Calif. - At long last modern science has found 
Im answer to that age-old ques­ tion — does the chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? 
Not if the gum contains a new swee­ tening agent called “ neohesperidin di- 
Jiydroehaleone,” according to Dr. Vin­ cent P. Maier, the director of the U.S. 
Department of 
Agriculture’s 
Fruit 

Try and pronounce it 

 and Vegetable Chemistry Laboratory in Pasadena. 
Neo-DHC, as it is known to its de­ velopers there, is a substance derived from grapefruit and orange rinds that is 1,ooo to 1.5oo times sweeter than sucrose, a naturally-occurring sugar, and considerably longer-lasting in its ability to stimulate the human taste 

 buds. 
Those properties should make Neo- 
DHC extremely attractive to food pro­ cessors, and chewing gum m anu­ facturers in particular, when and if the substance gains approval from the 
Fond and Drug Administration. Maier said. 
That approval is now being sought 
Pilgrim forced to ride bike 

! Albert Rodriguez, beset with pulled ham string muscles in both legs, switched to a bicycle Saturday a few jiffies short of his last over-night stop. 
* He is to leave from Harlingen for the 
JKiirch of Miracles in San Juan early 
^Sunday. i His sister, Lydia Rodriguez, report­ ed Saturday that her brother, who is running on behalf of his daugher, 
J>tephani and all other mentally re­ garded children, switched to a bicycle. 

Rodriguez, a police sergeant at the 
University of Texas at San Antonio plans to reach the famous church in the Rio Grande Valley by IO a m. 
Sunday, Lydia said. 
His completion of the 32o-mile pil­ grimage run to San Juan will bo the fulfillment of a promise Rodriguez made if Stephanie lived to her fifth birthday, which is on Sunday. 
Stephanie was born with brain da­ mage and other birth defects, includ­ 

 ing a heart murmur, congenial dislo­ cated hip and breathing difficulties. 
She was not expected to live past early childhood. 
The 33-year-old marathon runner began his journey on foot, from San 
Antonio on Wednesday. He said, re­ ported his sister, he would decide 
Sunday whether to run or bicycle the last laps to the shrine of San Juan. 
Rodriguez is reported due back in 
San Antonio by 8 p.m. Sunday. 

 by two firms. California Aromatics and 
Flavors, of Sun Valley, Calif., and Nu- trilite, of Buena Park, Calif. These are the only two companies recently li­ censed to make quantities of Neo-DHA for research purposes. 
“ We expect to get approval (for commercial use) within the next three to six month*,’’ said Mrs. Katherine 
Joines, the administrative director of 
California Arom atic. “ W e’ve been working on it for five years now and we think it’s a shoo-in (as a replacement) for Saccharin.’’ 
Sim ilar tests with Neo-DHC have been run on dogs and rats for two years, Maier said, and no health prob­ lems have been seen. 
Neo-DHC is found in the white pulp of grapefruit and of Seville oranges, the^kind that are normally used to make marma­ lade. It was discovered, M aier ex­ plained, by two of his laboratory’s re­ search chemists, Dr. Robert M. Hor­ owitz and Bruno Gentile, back in the early 198os as they sought to determine just*what it is that makes grapefruit bitter. 
That substance is called “ naringin,” 

 a member of a class of similar com- came upon neohesperidin in Seville pounds collectively known as “ DHC.” oranges. 
Seeking a way to reduce the bitterness 
When modified slightly, both com- of nanngin, rtorowuz and Gentile pounds bring forth a sensation of looked at other DHC compounds and sweetness instead of bitterness.

Abductor’s victims free 

ORLANDO, Fla. (A F ) — A man who shot two people and hold five others hos­ tage for more than IO hours refused to surrender and died Saturday in a blazing, tear gas-filled apartment. Police said he probably had shot himself. 
The hostages, two women and three children, were safe and not seriously hurt. 
Police Chief James York said “ the real tragedy” was that the dead man, Algie 
Simmons, twice before had been charged with taking hostages and kidnaping. 
2 wounds 

York said a preliminary report showed that Simmons, 42, suffered two gunshot wounds. “ The wound which was probably fatal was probably self-inflicted,” said 
York. 
Simmons released the children and a police department SWAT team rescued the women before tear-gas canisters set the second-floor apartment ablaze. 
The motive appeared to have been Sim ­ mons’ jealousy over one of the two female hostages. York said. 
The wounded, a man and a woman, were reported in fair condition at a hospital. 
Simmons’ body was found beneath a pile of debris in a hallway of the apartment located in a sprawling complex. 
York said that in August 1972 Simmons released two hostages from an Orlando 

The gunman's hotly teas fou n d beneath a pile o f debris in a hallw ay o f the apartm ent 

 apartment after police used tear gas, and on another occasion was charged with forcing a woman at gunpoint to accompany him from Atlanta to Orlando, he said. 
Why free? 

“ He shouldn't have been on the streets,” said York. 
“ We know he was charged with kidnap­ ing one time and based on our records he did receive three years,” said Sgt. Stephen 
Maroney. “ Right now we’re trying to es­ tablish the sequence in his criminal record.” 
Maroney said tear gas was used Satur­ day because Simmons had released hos­ tages when it was used in 1972. 
“ We tried our best” to get him to sur­ render, the chief said, “ but our luck kind of gave out.” 
Simmons had been the boyfriend of 
Twinity DuBose, 26, one of the two women held hostage, said police spokesman Bruce liaison. 
“ He just wouldn’t leave her alone,” said 
Mrs. DuBose’s sister, Margolia Anderson. 

"They went together a long time ago, but he kept coming back and beating her up and threatening to shoot her or the kids.” 
Henson said Simmons, a restaurant chef, had a police record for assaulting and threatening Mrs. DuBose and that he had recently served a jail sentence and was out on probation. Mrs. DuBose and her children’s father were separated. 
Began Friday 

Police said the episode began late 
Friday when the gunman approached 
Louis Smith, 4o, and Patricia Truss, 26, as they were leaving Mrs. DuBose’s apart­ ment. 
He shot and wounded them both and forced Mrs DuBose back into her apart­ ment, where her cousin. Patricia Carson, had remained with her own child and Mrs. 
DuBose’s two young sons. 
Laverne Carson, Patricia’s sister, also was in the home but managed to escape. 
She alerted police and neighbors. 
Patricia Carson’s 7-year-old son, Her- shel, was released shortly after daybreak 
Saturday after police set up communica­ tion with Simmons over a field telephone system which Simmons allowed to be car­ ried into the apartment by one of the chil­ dren. 
He reportedly traded the child for some beer.

T h is h a s b ro u g h t a r e m a r k a b l e amount of stability. Mexico is not, nor has it bern for years, the revolutionary hotbed m any Americans imagine, 
It is, in truth, a tightly-ruled nation with a huge and im p lacable b u re a u ­ cracy, a growing middle class, an en ­ ormously wealthy upper class, and the host record in Latin A m erica for in­ d u s tr ia l g ro w th and eco n o m ic p r o ­ gress 
T he other side of till’ p ic tu re is a working force with almost half of its m e m b e rs cither jobless or u n d e re m ­ ployed Its agricultural system has not supplied all its needs since 1971, forc­ ing the growing importation of staple foods. Poverty continues from g e n era­ tion to generation 
Lopez Portillo does not see in this the danger of a peasant uprising.

R o d . a form er University of Texas at 
Austin student and now Mexico’s Min­ ister of Foreign Relations, th at calls for both the U S and Mexico to ack ­ nowledge the m u tuality of our p ro b ­ lems. 
This m eans trade and not aid; U.S. help in reducing Mexico’s im balance of trade by buying m ore Mexican pro­ d ucts; m o re in v e stm e n ts and few er loans. It m eans, R o d em p h asize s, a dignified viewing of the relationships of the two countries in an overall con­ tex t. It m e a n s v ie w in g how o ur dealings affect the two countries as a whole and not how trade m ay im pact on individual or private interests. 
Understanding 
Lopez Portillo obviously feels his re ­ ce n t m e e t in g in W a s h in g to n w ith 
Jim m y C arter was successful and that a now u n d e r s ta n d in g w a s re a c h e d which will recognize Mexico’s special stan d in g as a neighbor and a m ajo r buyer of U.S. goods. “ An agenda was set and will be dealt w ith ,” he says confidently. 
The C arter adm inistration is expect­ ed to take steps to p erm it m ore Mexi­ can im ports, to encourage private in­ vestm ent in Mexican business, to en­ courage more A merican tourists and to provide m ore loans, if needed. 
This is in A m erica’s interest. Mexi­ can officials point out, citing how the sagging Mexican economy has an im ­ pact on the U.S. 
The devaluation of the peso last fall 
•drastically cut M exican sho pp ing in the b o rd er states, esp ecially T exas. 
The purchase of goods im ported from the U .S. d ro p p ed . M ex ican to u ris ts stopped arriving. And a flood of the so-called “ u n d o c u m e n te d w o r k e r s '' left M exico to c o m p e t e w ith U .S. w orkers for jobs. 
It is this in terd ep en d e n ce along a frontier of nearly 2,ooo m iles that in­ e x tric a b ly links th e tw o n a tio n s to ­ gether. 
Different 
Lopez Portillo, at 57 an experienced adm inistrator and politician as well as a form er professor of political science, is unlike his predecessor, Echeverria. 
He is quiet, atten tive and an sw ers questions succinctly with a m inim um of words. E cheverria tended to offer speeches instead of replies. 
Lopez Portillo n ot only hopes to res­ tru c tu re the b u re a u c ra c y but is also attem pting to change its life style. He has instructed his m in is te rs to close their m inistries at 7 p.m. and go home to th e ir fam ilies. He h im s e lf w o rks until about 9 p.m. and declines to work weekends after 3 p.m . on Saturday. 
(•one are the days when E cheverria and his staff worked until 4 a.m . and returned to the office after a few hours sleep. C abinet m in is te rs w e re often sum m oned to I a.m . conferences. 
Lopez Portillo is a prudent m an who ke eps in shape by jogging around the presidential grounds at Los Pinos near 
Chapultepec Park. 
He m ay be conserving his strength because, as he readily concedes, the problem s of inflation, devaluation and the economy are not the biggest chal­ lenges he faces. 
A lw ays in th e b a c k g r o u n d is th e question of agrarian reform , the unrest of the campesinos who till the fields. and the prospect of class w arfare to determ ine the ownership of the land.

Claimants begin hunt for lost gold treasure 

NEW VORK TIMES SERVICE 
V IC T O R IO 
P E A K . 
N M. — .lark Hull, his sunburned face shaded by his white cowboy hat. paused at the top of Vic­ tors Peak and to a small outcropping in the rock. 
“ That’s it there.” he said. 
Behind a few feet of rock, according to Hull, is the tunnel that stretches for hundreds of feet and opens into the lost cavern where the late 
Milton E. “ Doc” Moss said he discovered an untold fortune in gold bars back in 1937. 
Tony Jo lle y , H u ll’s partner, agreed the out­ cropping marked the tunnel. Jolley said he had been with Noss on sever­ al occasions when the two had carried gold bars out of the cavern. 
But that was before a faulty dynam ite blast sealed the tunnel with most of the riches still inside. 
Been inside 
Jo lley and H ull, who said he, too, had been in­ side the cavern before it was sealed, are among more than 5o individuals who believe this barren mountain hides the le­ gendary treausure of 
Victorio Peak and wjio claim some part of it. 
The group has retained 
Norman Scott, head of a 
F'lorida-based treausure hunting firm , to make the first attempt in more than a decade to find the cavern. 
Scott said he had marked the site pointed out by Hull and would begin early 
Sunday morning to take radar soundings that would show whether the tunnel is really there. If it is, 
Scott said, the excavation of the site will begin on 
Monday, using b u ll­ dozers and picks and shovels. 
High in mountains 
The treasure hunters left shortly after dawn 
Saturday from Cotton­ wood Canyon, high in the snaggle-toothed m oun­ tains that line the wes­ tern boundary of the 
5,ooo-square-mile White 
Sands facility, the largest m ilitary reservation in the country. 
The A rm y last gave permission for such a search in 1963. when the 
Gaddis M ining Co. of 
Denver, working on be­ half of the New Mexico 
State Museum, spent two months and 
$25o,ooo sinking deep-earth sounding devices into the rock around the peak. 
They discovered only that Victorio Peak con­ tained no gold-bearing ore.

TREASURE hunters Saturday invaded Victorio Peak — on W h ite Sands M issile R a n ge in south-central N e w 
M exico — in search of a reported cache of gold bars found by the late Earl “ Doc” Noss, w hose w idow (inset) has laid a claim on the treasure if found 

 was averted Saturday when White Sands offi­ cials, after consulting with Army Department lawyers in Washington, decided to allow Scott and his team to proceed, even though one of the six groups that have filed of­ ficia lly recognized claim s to the treasure had not consented to the search 

 begin on schedule with or without the blessing of 
Roscoe B a rr, the lone holdout. 
Claimant 
At a news conference on the White Sands base 
Saturday, David Darr. an attorney for Mrs. Ova 
Noss, one of the c la i­ mants, made it clear that, although she was

The 
A rm y’s long- not cooperating with standing position, restat- Scott, neither was she cd Saturday by a spokes- relinquishing her claim man, Maj. Kenneth Able, to any treasure that has been, “ There is no gold on this installation.” 
After years of refusing requests from civilians to search the Victorio area, the Army decided to per­ mit one all-out search in the hope, as Able said, it would put the legends to rest once and for all. 
But the Pentagon had been wary of agreeing to an expedition that might be contested by one of the groups of claimants. Five of the six registered, groups have either joined' in Scott’s enterprise or agreed not to challenge it, and the Army finally concluded that “ Opera­ tion Goldfinder” could

Mrs. Noss. Doc Noss's first wife, had carried on his futuile search for the lost cave for several years after he was shot to death in 1949. 
The claimants differ on the precise location of the cavern where Doc Noss said he found gold bars 
“ stacked like cord­ wood,’’ jeweled crowns and other precious arti­ facts, and Scott has plot­ ted out three general ar­ eas that take account of the variances. 
If no tunnel or treasure materializes on the peak itself, by Sunday, the team will move its oper-

 examines grid covering mine shaft atop Victorio Peak 

 ation north of the peak 
Monday. 
If the gold is not found there, Scott plans to dig at a third site to the south of the peak before the excavation permit runs out March 29. 
Attraction 
The Army is concerned that the activity in the rugged mountains may attract amateur treasure hunters, intent on racing 
Scott to the gold The 
W hite Sands M ilitary 
Police unit is sending out round-the-clock heli­ copter patrols to warn interlopers away. 
Such a precaution hardly seems necessary, given the inaccessibility of the digging sites and the hazards, natural and man-made, that sur­ round them 
For example, reporters had to rise before dawn 
Saturday to drive to the 
Army's checkpoint north of Las Cruces, where they were loaded in mili­ tary personnel carriers and ferried over nearly im passable roads through Cottonwood Can­ yon. 
The canyon is about 4o m iles south of T rinity 
Site, the spot where the first successful test of an atomic device took place almost 37 years ago. 
Cautioned 
Before leaving, the expedition members were cautioned to watch closely for the rattles­ nakes that swarm over these mountains in great numbers at this time of year and were given dia­ gram s of unexploded ordnance — aerial rock- j cts, cannon shells and anti-personnel bombs — with w hich, the Arm y warned, the range had| been heavily contaminat­ ed by years of aircraft target practice. 
“ Do not touch any item s on range,” the 
Army leaflet said. 

Mrs.'Noss made a sur­ prise appearance, but said she was present merely as an observer. 
Scott s crew said they did not expect her to provide them with any assis tanee. 
Kidnap suspect held, but victims missing 

TULSA, Okla (A P ) - 
Two women — the wife of a Tulsa businessman and her employe — were missing for a second day 
Saturday in what author­ ities said was a kidnap­ ing designed to extort 

$ 5oo,ooo. 
One suspect was a r­ rested when a call to the businessman was traced to a mobile home in 
Jenks, just south of here. 
Dist. Atty. S M Fallis Jr. said Larry Chaney, 34, would be charged with kidnaping. 
He was being ques­ tioned by state and local officers trying to locate the two women 

The m issing women were identified as Kendal 

Ashmore, 35. and Kathy 
Anne Brown, 21. M iss 
Brown was employed by 
Mrs. Ashmore in the family’s extensive horse breeding operation. 
Mrs, Ashmore’s hus­ band, Phillip, was told in a telephone call Thurs­ day night that the women had been abducted, auth­ orities said He was dir­ ected to leave $5oo,ooo in unmarked HOO bills at a location near Jenks on 
Friday night. 
At the urging of slate, federal and local officers, reporters withheld the story until after the ar­ rest of Chancy on Satur­ day. 
Ashmore arranged to have the money dropped 

 inside an old rodeo arena near Jenks, authorities said. 
Two hours later, an­ other call told him the money was in the wrong place and he.would get a later call telling him where to place it. 

That second call was traced and Chuney, who authorities said was in the contracting business, was arrested early Sa­ turday. 

The money, which had been stuffed into two bags, was picked up by- authorities and was not replaced, investigators said. 
Mrs. Ashmore is the daughter of 
Haskell 

Gaither, publisher of The 
Jeffersonian, a Pryor. 
Okla., weekly new­ spaper. She and Miss 
Brown reportedly had gone out to inspect some horses and buy some hay. 
Truck found 
Their abandoned pick­ up truck was found southeast of 
Tulsa, several miles from the 
Ashmore home 
The Ashmores have an 
11-year-old daughter and 
9-yearold son. 
Ashmore is president of Ashland Development 
Co., which develops land holdings and builds and sells homes 
He was chairman of the 
Riverside National Bank until he sold it last year.

Teen-age hijackers give up in Lebanon

B E IR U T , 
Lebanon 
\P) — Two teen-agers 
•arrying small pistols ii jacked a 
Turkish primer to Beirut Saturn jay but surrendered a 
'pw hours later to an un- irmed Lebanese major. 
The 173 passengers, including six infants 
Acre released unharmed.

Turkish A irlines of­ ficials said the hijackers, identified as 
Ism ail

Ashan and 
Mohammed Bassan Ban- nefi Guzel, both 18. com­ mandeered the Boeing 
727 on a domestic flight from the southeastern 
Turkish town of Diyar- bakir to the capital of 
Ankara. 
Alter landing about 5oo yards from the war- 
Marred Beirut airport terminal, the hijackers demanded fuel and the equivalent of $3oo,ooo in 
Turkish currency. 
Later, after releasing the passengers, the hijackers asked to talk with Palestinian leaders and be taken to a refugee

 camp “ where someone speaks Turkish, that’s a ll.” They finally sur­ rendered about an hour later. 
Lebanese police said the only person injured during the ordeal was the copilot, Duraki Etim , who was shot in the right thigh and hit in the face during the takeover. Be was later seen smiling and walking through the term inal, with blood­ stains on his shirt. 
“ We made it clear to them that they would not get away with it,” said 
Premier Salim El-Boss, who personally directed operations. 
Troops of the Arab peacekeeping force, which supervises the cease-fire that ended the 
Lebanese civ il war. quickly surrounded the plane after it landed, and 
Lebanese security forces wearing bullet-proof 

 vests took up positions nearby. 
The hijackers spoke only Turkish and K u r­ dish and had trouble ex­ plaining their demands to the Arabic-speaking 
Lebanese. They made no specific threats and did not give any indication of their motives beyond the ransom demand. 
After the plane landed, one of the hijackers ap­ peared at the door of the first class compartment and began shouting at the troops in Turkish, w it­ nesses said 
When he realized no one understood, he a l­ lowed the.Turkish pilot. 

Kurai Ahmet, to speak to officers on the ground in

A Turkish-speaking news photographer was able to translate into 
Arabic for the authorities until a Turkish diplomat arrived at the airport. 
After I '*2 hours of negotiations, the two agreed to release the passengers but kept the crew aboard. They also demanded to talk to a 
Turkish-speaking Pales­ tinian. 
Another hour went by, and Boss and the security chiefs were considering storming the plane. Fin­ ally the major, who was not identified, walked out to the aircraft and per­ suaded the youths to sur­ render. 
The passengers were taken to the V IP lounge for a flight hack to Tur­ key. airline officials said.

W ASHINGTON (A P ) 
— The Carter adm inis­ tration is working up its decisions on the $5.4 bil­ lion food stamp program which channels federal grocery-buying aid to some five m illion families. 
Among the questions the White House, the 
Agriculture Department and other administration policy-makers are ask­ ing: How many of some 
7oo.(KW families above the poverty line will be a l­ lowed to continue on the rolls? How many addi­ tional poor will be drawn into the program? What w ill the cost be to taxpayers? 
Hearings 
House and 
Senate agriculture subcommit­ tees are commencing hearings tins week on congressional food-stamp bills. The program ex­ pires Sept. 3o. 
The number receiving monthly food-buying help and the cost to taxpayers fluctuates with sharp changes in the national ii nemployment picture. 

But thevprogram has been stable since last summer. 

That stability has muf­ fled public outcries for reform, but the congres­ sional agriculture com­ mittees, 
Agriculture 
Secretary Bob S. Berg- land and outside web fare-rights groups arc pushing for changes. 
They want to disqualify middle-income families 
— who now qualify for stamps they may not need — and improve benefits to the poorest 

 families. 
Tentative USHA plans would open the door lo many of the estimated six million eligible poor families — they earn less than $4,6oo annually — who don’t now p ar­ ticipate. To do this the agency is mulling ending the requirement that recipients pay for the stamps. 
As the program stands, certified recipients must pay about 4o per cent of the face value of the monthly allotment of redeemable coupons*.

COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES 
SE O U L — President

He declared to a cabin­ et meeting that South 
Korea must now have a greater self-confidence in national defense capabi­ lity.

Canadian: Duped U.S. agent 

N fW SO A Y SERVICE 
NEW VORK — A Canadian agricul­ tural technician working in Cuba says he was paid $5,ooo by an American intelligence agent in 1962 to infect 
Cuban turkeys with a fatal disease. 
The Canadian, who disclosed his story to Newsday, said the turkeys were going to die anyway, but since the agent wanted to pay him, he took the money. 
More than 8,ooo turkeys on a Cuban state farm subsequently did die — but not because he infected them with the 
Newcastle disease virus he says he received in Canada from a military 

 intelligence operative. 
Newcastle is a viral disease that affects the respiratory organs of poultry, particularly young chickens, ducks and turkeys. 
The technician said he destroyed the virus before leaving Canada for Cuba in the spring of 1962 and later had a good time with the money. 
Major details of the Canadian's story have been confirmed by sources within and outside the U.S. intelligence com­ munity. 
During the summer of 1962. he said, about 8,(MIO turkeys at the Cuban farm died of neglect or other causes nnre 

 lated to the virus scheme. 
"Either the Cubans would not work, or they were off reading some tract by 
Mao Tse-tung," he said. 
The farm, known as FR I, was in the 
Pinar del Rio province of western 
Cuba. According to U.S. intelligence reports, the Cubans — as well as the 
Americans — still believe the turkeys died as the result of espionage. 
The Canadian was working as an adviser to the Cuban government and visited farms. He said he told the 
American agent who approached him that — based on his observations — the turkeys were going to die anyway. 

But the agent continued to press him, he said, and he finally agreed to carry out the operation. 
"If they were stupid enough to pay me $5,ooo to kill birds that were as good as dead already, I figured they'd just give the money to someone else,” he said. 
The Cubans were pushing turkey production in 1962 because of an urgent need to quickly increase their meat supply that had been cut sharply by the 
U.S. trade embargo and a deteriorat­ ing production system brought about by collectivization of agriculture, ivi- zation of agriculture.

Tex^as traffic deaths drop sharply in 1976 

AUSTIN (A F) - There were nearly 
2o1) fewer traffic deaths in Texas in 
1976 than there were the year before. says Col. Wilson E. Speir, director of the Texas Department of Public Safe­ ty- 
Speir said traffic deaths on Texas roads totaled 3,23o in 1976. compared t o 
3,429 fatalities i i i 1975, a decline o f six lier cent. 
It was the lowest death count for 
Texas since 1965, with the exception of 
1974 when the national energy crisis produced a sharp drop in speed and travel and 3.o46 deaths. Speir added 
DFS statistics, however, show that 

 traffic injuries rose five per cent last year, while total collisions climbed two per cent. There were 145,282 persons hurt in traffic accidents, compared to 
138 962 injured during 1975 
Accidents totaled 479,2o3 in 1976, an increase from the 468,596 recorded the prev ions year. 
Meanwhile. Speir said traffic deaths rose by two per cent nationwide with 
47,1oo killed, according to National 
Safety Council figures 
The DFS head said Texas motorists drove a record 91.27 billion vehicles miles during 1976, an eight per cent increase over 1975 travel.

By LIZ SWEET 
EXPRESS NEW S EDUCATION WRITER 

With a marathon final session of the house of delegates, m em bers of the 
T exas 
S tate 
Teachers' Assn. wrapped up their 98th annual con­ vent ion late S atu rd a y night. 
During the three-day convention h e a d q u a r ­ tered in the San Antonio 
Convention (’enter, 1,5o(1 elected delegates rep re­ senting 5oo local associa­ tions passed 188 resolu­ tions and 14 amendments to the TSTA constitution. 
(Irate Grimes, TSTA p re sid e n t and a M a r­ shall. Tex. teacher, pre­ sided over the convention which was dedicated to 
Sen. A. M. Aikin .lr. of 
Paris. 
Sen. Aikin. now in his 
45th year in the Texas 
Legislature, is the co­ author with Sen. W. E. 
Snelson of Midland of the 
TSTA-sponsored school 

 finance and teacher re­ tirement bills in the cur­ rent legislative session 
In F rid a y afternoon's session. Virginia Allred 
Stacey, a teacher in the 
Lackland School District, was in tro d u c ed as the 
1977-78 TSTA state presi­ dent-elect. 
Mrs. Stacey defeated 
Don Simmons of Abilene in recent statewide bal­ loting am ong 
TSTA members. 
She will a s s u m e the president elect office on 
June I and will autom a­ tically succeed to the 
TSTA presidency June I, 
1978. 
Also in F rid a y ’s se s­ sion. the TSTA house of d eleg a tes elected four new members to the state executive com m ittee to secure ethnic m inority representation equal to the 2o.6 ethnic minority memberships of TSTA. 

The ex ecu tiv e c o m ­ mittee recently acknow- 

Delegates voted to recommend teachers support ratification o f the Equal Rights 
Am endm ent 

I edged that this ethnic minority percentage was not ac co m p lish ed through the regular elec­ tion process in the 2(1 
TSTA districts. 
The four new co m ­ m itte e m e m b e rs, who were elected from 3o no­ m in ees and who will serve one year terms, are 
Samuel Kuykendall III of 
San Antonio, Mary Lee 
Reyna of San Antonio, 
H enry ('. Je n n in g s of 
Waco and J. I). Villareal of Mission. 
In Saturday’s session, delegates also adopted the TSTA Platform and a 
C om prehensive A ffilia­ tion Program. 
The program outlines a time plan to In' used by the TSTA in completing local, district and state 

 requirem ents for affilia­ tion with the N ational 
Education Assn. accord­ ing to the new standards established in 1972. 
According to the time plan, the TSTA will have completed all the steps for the affiliation process by June of 1978. 

Sparks fly 
Also during Saturday's otherwise lowkey house of d e leg a tes se ssio n , sm all sp a rk s flew m o­ mentarily over two reso­ lutions. 
After some discussion d ele g a tes voted to r e ­ co m m en d th at 
TSTA support ratification of the 
E qual R ights A m en d ­ ment. 
M em bers also agreed to recommend that TSTA 

 seek and support legisla­ tion specifically defining legal residency req u ire­ m ents for Texas public school a tte n d a n c e to alleviate the burden on public schools being caused by illegal aliens. 
O th er reso lu tio n s passed by the house of delegates include: 
Resolutions 
• That all local school, d is tric t bo ard s of trustees adopt and prac­ tice policies which e n ­ courage direct and open co m m u n ic atio n s. Such policies should provide a structure for com m uni­ cation among local edu­ cation associations, dis­ trict adm inistrators and boards of trustees. 
• That TSTA encour­ age local school districts 

 to develop and im p le ­ m ent eq u itab le p ro fes­ sional evaluation instru­ ments designed to facili­ tate teacher evaluation by school su p erv iso ry personnel. 
• 
T hat local school boards be encouraged to establish a procedure for exclusive recognition of a local teach er org an iza­ tion as the representative of the teachers. 

Classrooms 
• That TSTA seek le­ gislation to establish m aximum ceilings on the num ber of pupils in each classroom: 2o stu ­ dents in k in d e rg a rte n and first grade, 22 stu ­ dents in g rad e s two through five, and 25 stu­ dents in g ra d e s six through 12. 
• That the practice by local districts of making residency in the district m andatory for em p lo y ­ ment be abolished by the legislature.

Mexicans give back ransom 
MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) 
— A Kentucky man who paid 
$14,oo1) ransom to Mexican po­ lice in this border city for Ins son’s release had his money returned in its original wrap­ pers Saturday by Mexican offi­ cials. 
U.S. Consul F ra n c is A ren / of 
Brownsville said the fear of losing tourist trad e was one reaso n th at prompted tin' last action by Mexican authorities on behalf of Perry Greer of 
Lexington. Ky. 
Greer said he received a phone call from his son. Perry Lee Greer Jr.. 19. at 4 a.m . W ednesday tellin g of a demand by 
Matamoras police for 
$2o,(HIO for his son’s release Irom a m arijautia possession c h a rg e. The younger Greer later said the dope was put in hts ear by the police. 

The father flew down and m et a policem an on a b rid g e betw een 
Brow nsville and M atam o ras. The 

Youth shot in front o f own hom e 

 father handed over $14,ooo in a bank bag, and his son was released from a patrol car parked near the bridge. 
“ Obviously, I’m very pleased with the outcome,’’ said Greer. “The Mex­ icans bent over backwards to help us.’’ 
Angel Alvaro Perez, assistant state chief of police for the sta te of 
T am aulipas. said the m an who received the money was a 45-year-old assistant Matamoras police chief 
Perez said he met (he m an at a 
Brownsville service station at 2 a.in. 
Saturday when the Matamoras officer handed over the money and the keys to the 1976 Buick the younger Greer had driven into Mexico Tuesday night. 
The Mexican official said the man was not arrested because “ we have no authority in the United States." 

Authority misuse 

Perez said the man. who has been stripped of his authority, has been charged in Mexico with misuse of authority and extortion and faces a 
25-year prison sentence if convicted. 
Perez said he and Leopoldo J. Bello 
Lopez, assistant attorney general for 
T am au lip as. w ere o rd ered to Ma- laments by the state government to investigate "to show American tourists that there are honest policemen and officials in Mexico.’’ 
Perez said the man accused of the extortion was believed to be in the 
United States where authorities had been asked to help locate him.

Opera is alive and well in Texas, and the Texas 
Opera Theater certainly helps to make it so. 
As part of its current tour, this division of the 
Houston G rand O pera gave a sparkling produc- tion of M o z a rt’s “ The 
M a rria g e of F ig a r o ’’ 
Friday night in Trinity 
University’s Laurie Au­ ditorium. 
Sung in English, both the m usic and stag in g were skillfully handled in this en g ag in g p e rfo r­ mance 
A clea r asset to this production was the o r­ chestra. which gave ex­ cellent support John De- 
Main. the co n d u c to r, kept the m usical pace moving and brought all the m u sica l forces to ­ g eth e r in a very solid performance. 
All of the s in g e rs played their p arts well anil with excellent m usi­ cal command Even the w eakest acto r. Jo se p h 
W arner as Dr. Bartolo and Antonio, whose ac­ tions did not always seem m otivated, brought off his roh> comfortably. 
Otherwise both singing and acting w ere ex c el­ lent. 
Erie fialfvarson as Fi­ garo. M aryanne Telese as Susanna, and Warren 
Ellsw orth as Count Al­ u m n a sang with strong, resonant voices and tossed off the technical d em a n d s of tin' m usic with ease. 
Linda Kowalski played 
Cherubim) with a p p r o ­ priate m asculine sw ag­ ger and displayed a re ­ m arkably clear, lyrical voice. 
T hese w ere all very strong principals, but my favorite was P a m e la 
Porter, who as Countess 
A lm aviva had the greatest opportunity to display her a b u n d a n t musical ability. 

Review 

She was in excellent control of long phrases and wide vocal ran g e, which together with her rich, full voice created the most expressive mo­ ments of the evening. 
Rhode Lev ine directed the staging with an eye toward visual activity. It was well p ro p o rtio n ed action which kept the co­ mic effects alive and the pace moving Only occa­ sionally did it seem too much, and at those times one wished for a greater concern for the music. 
One such place was in 
"Voi che sapete,’’ Cher- ubino’s song to the Coun­ tess The visual gags at this point were funny but detracted from the m u­ sic. 
There is a thin line in opera between playing for e n te rta in m e n t and m a k in g good m usic. 
Since one of the purposes of the 
T exas 
O pera 
T h e a te r is to co n v ert opera goers, this is a line the com pany n ee d s to observe very carefully to make sure the music is not sacrificed purely for comic or dramatic effect. 
T e rre l M iller's sets and lights w ere ex c ep ­ tionally well designed. 
They were very sim ple but very effective. 
C o stu m es w ere also wed I chosen and used as much for visual balance as for authentic dress. 
M issionary goals of com panies like1 this so­ metimes seem self-cons­ cious. If good opera is done well, it will enter­ tain. I’m not su re any other effort converts any more people. 
But even if its purpose is self-conscious, the 
Texas Opera Theater de­ serves praise for a well executed, highly e n te r­ taining and very musical production of “ The Mar­ riage of Figaro.’’

ASSOCIATED WISS 
AMHERST, Mass. 
— One wintry Friday afternoon, 3o stu ­ dents from H am p­ shire College did so­ mething they always wanted to do once, hut perhaps not twice. 
They set out into the rural Connecticut Valley to the Sunderland Cave, not far from this college town in western M assa­ chusetts. 
They hiked up the steep snow banks, ex ­ plored the ice sculpture of the cave, then slid down the snowfaces. 
They made a pyramid of themselves to climb the biggest sycam ore tree east of the Mississippi. 
They chewed the bark of a tree. It tasted like wintergreen. A professor from the school of natur­ al science who acco m ­ panied the group told the stu d en ts about the geological formation of the cave and how to make beer out of birch. 
For tun 
Only seven years old. 
H am pshire College — enrollment 1.225. faculty 
124, tuition $4,35o — opt­ ed for sports for fun in­ stead of competition. It attem pts to relate out­ door recreatio n to academ ics. A blend of body and mind. 
One such blend is a course called ‘‘Everyth­ ing You Always Wanted to Do Once — but P e r­ haps Not Twice." There is a waiting list to enroll. 
The class meets each 
F riday afternoon and does something different on each outing. Activities include rock clim bing, cross country sk iin g , winter camping and can­ oeing. 
"The catch is to attract beginners who just want to try something once to see if they like it," says 
Carol F ish e r, one of a half-dozen instructors in the program. 
Miss Fisher is a 1975 graduate of the Universi­ ty of Montana, where she majored in environmen­ tal biology and botany. 
She also is the N orth 
American women’s w ild- uater kayak champion. 
Kayaks 
For a J a n u a ry te rm course, she and a dozen students ran 35o miles of the Suwannee and Peace 
Rivers and the 
Ever­ glades of Georgia and 
Florida in their kayaks. 
They camped on wooden platforms built on trees in the swamps. By using a school van and packing

 their own food, the month-long trip cost each student $148. 
Another January-term course, “ Women In The 
Wilderness," includes a month-long trek into the mountains and canyons of New Mexico. It was led by instructor Joy Hardin. 
29, who was hired four years ago "to bring in the educational and p sy ­ chological side of th e outdoors experience. 
"It is a self-discovery of some of the im ag es th at are fearful to women,” says Miss Har­ din. "The wildnerness is assumed to be a m a n ’s territory. It is a chance for them to have no men to depend on.” 
The outdoors program extends to non-students working at the college and to "Drop In” centers for high school students from broken homes. 
Deborah Cole, 24, came from Syracuse. N Y., to work as a secretary at 
Hampshire. Now she is a part-time secretary and part-tim e instructor in rock climbing. 
Learning 
"It was a sport I was good at im m ed iately ," she recalls. " I t d id n 't require being part of a team. It was something personal. I ended up wanting to see how excit­ ed I could get o th e r beginners." 
Susan 
Calkins, an education student from 
Carlisle, Mass., teaches at the "Drop-In” center in nearby Northampton. 
She and h er stu d e n ts learn from eat*h other, and she can learn from them. 
" I t is p art of academ ics, adolescent psychology,” says Miss 
Calkins. " I can get a b etter u n d e rsta n d in g how they feel. They are a tough bunch, u sin g four-letter words all the time. For most of them, the outdoors is all brand new. It is im portant to them. It is rewarding for me.”

"The Literature of Great 
Expectations,” in which students simulate the ex­ periences of real expedi­ tions that the a u th o rs wrote about, from Cortes in the 16th century to the present

"This," says Roberts, 
"lends itself better to in­ tellectual reflection than tackle football. Our ideas are away from the tradi­ tional physical education.” 
Three years ago, the college opened a 
$1.8-million indoor recreation center. The ce n ter contains a glassed-in pool. Since th ere are no in te rc o l­ legiate swim teams, the college offers more than 
3o hours of recreational swimming per week. 
The college also h as eight all-weather surface tennis courts and four indoor courts. There are outdoor playing fields for volleyball, soccer, soft­ ball and Frisbee. Several m iles of c ro ss-co u n try ski trails surround the 
55o acres of college cam ­ pus that were once farm ­ land and forest. 
The annual budget for the sports and outdoors p ro g ra m is $123,ooo, about 1.5 per cent of the total college budget of $8 million. 
If Hampshire’s recrea­ tional program is u n u ­ sual, so is its academ ic program. Classes are not mandatory. There are no specific course re q u ire ­ ments. No grades are gi­ ven. 
Divisions 
There is no such thing as a freshman or senior.

Our six First Ladies 

ASSO CIA TED PRESS 
W ASHINGTON - We call them by their first names, sn well dn we know them. Bess, 
Mamie, Jackie, Lady Bird, Pat, 
Betty. 
We talk of them like family. B e ss and Harry were childhood sweethearts, you know, lf Mamie knew Ike had an affair, she never let on. Jack ie is dat­ ing.... 
Oh, yes, we know some intimate de­ tails. Little ones, like how Mrs. Joh n ­ son Rot her name from a baby nurse who proclaimed her “ purty as a lady bird.” Romantic ones: Dick proposed to Pat on the day they met. T ra g ic on es: Betty had ca n ce r and had a breast removed. 
Whether they like it or not — and most of them don’t — wives of P r e ­ sidents achieve enduring celebrity sta­ tu s. P at Nixon got a h a lf m illion get well le tte rs a fte r her stro k e . 
Widows wrote Mrs. Johnson “ I know’ what you're going through” after L B J died. B ess Truman could count on a deluge of card s for her recent 92nd birthday. 
History casts a ledger-sheet eye at 
Presidents; a plus here, a minus there. 
Their wives are rem em b ered m ore kindly. Thus, Bess Truman and Mamie 
E isen h ow er could be p ra ise d for rem aining in the b ack groun d, J a c ­ queline Kennedy for the glitter and sophistication she brought to the White 
House, Lady B ird Jo h n so n for her legacy of beautification. 
Devoted 
P a t N ixon ’ s im a g e is that of a devoted wife buoying a beleaguered husband. Betty Ford will be noted for her outspokenness and the exam p le she set for other women who have cancer. 
The new first lady, Rosalynn Carter, set out to put her own m ark on her husband’s incumbency while people still were learning to pronounce her first name (Roh-sah-lin, not Raw-se- lin), taking charge of C arter’s C om ­ mission on Mental Health. 
Good H ou sek eep in g M a g a z in e ’ s 
* annual poll of of the world’s Hi most ad­ mired women placed Pat Nixon No. I for 1973 and 1974 — the years of Nixon’s 
* lowest popularity. She was second to 
Betty Ford for 1975 and No. I again last year. 
The magazine noted that the ranking for 197ti may have reflected sympathy for Mrs. Nixon after her stroke in July.

 the news, has m ad e the list c o n sis­ tently. 
With such continuing interest and their ranks swelling to six this year, it seem ed a good idea to see how the former first ladies are faring. The tour began with Mrs. Onassis, at a luncheon in New York. 
What a re they (lainii these days? 

Twice-widowed, burned by go ssip sheets and harried by photographers, 
Jacqueline is Garbo-like in her pursuit of privacy. At 47, one of the world’s most elusive and intriguing women has a care er as a consulting editor for 
Viking Books. 
She w as flushed with p rid e over completing the first book that bears her name, an illustrated treatise on life in Imperial Russia. “ I don’t see it as work,” she said, with emphasis on the last word. But her publisher a ssu res that she really puts in a full schedule and that it is not just “ a Hollywood type of star with a double doing the hard part of the job.” With one book done, she is involved in a half dozen other publishing projects. 
Mrs. Onassis skillfully deflected talk from herself to the book. But it was obvious there is a change from the young Mrs. Kennedy who set fashion styles, promoted the arts and en ter­ tained in a m anner previously unk­ nown to the White House. Today, she is the m odern w orkin g w om an who dashes to the corner deli when work presses, who goes to a bu siness lun­ cheon in black turtleneck and slack s wearing no m akeup and no jew elry save a watch and gold wedding band. 
“ It’s sort of like holding your nose and ju m p in g,” she said of her first work p rodu ct. And, co n fid ed the woman once married to a president and once to a Greek shipping tycoon: 
“ I always wanted to be some kind of w riter or newspaper reporter, but after college I did other things.” 
Dancer 
Betty Ford wanted to be a dancer, but she, too, wound up in the White 
House. As she left, she planned “ to be very active in continuing with the sam e p ro jects that I have been a f­ filiated with when I was first lady.” 
True to her word. Mrs. Ford plunged right in, m aking telephone c a lls on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment and establishing herself in California a s a supporter of the arts. Her im ­ mediate problem was one most other p resid en tial w ives h a v e n ’t had — moving to a new state, renting a house and working on planning, building and furnishing a new home. 
Aboard the presidential jet that c a r­ ried the F ord s westward on J im m y 
C arter’s inauguration day she sa id , 
“ We enjoyed every minute we were in the White House, but I think it was time to go.” She had a sense of relief about steppin g out of the ‘ ‘ 7-day a week, 24-hour-a-day job,” a little nos­ talgia about leaving the capital where she and Jerry lived for 28 years. 
The beginning of private life has been busy for Betty Ford. “ I told Jerry 
I don’t want him home to lunch,” she said. She need not have worried. He’s played in two golf tournam ents and accepted four part-time jobs. 
The Fords’ social life at Rancho Mi­ rage — in the vicinity of Palm Springs 
— is active. S a y s a frien d: ‘ ‘ S h e ’s commenting on the ability just to pick and choose wherever she wants to go.” 
Now that she’s been a civilian for a while, has she expressed any regret about leaving the White House? The friend laughed and said, “ Oh, hell, no." 
Easy 
Lady Bird Johnson says she had no difficulty adjusting to life outside the 
White House. “ I always knew I would leave, I was always heading in that direction,” she says. ‘‘Home was Tex­ as. Washington was a long interlude.” 
Mrs. Johnson is the most visible of the six fo rm er p re sid e n tia l w ives because of her beautification projects, her work at the University of T exas where she was a regent for six years, her help with the LB J Library in Aus­ tin and her extensive travels. Inter­ viewed in her eighth-floor office at the library — a room with a Cinemascope view — she said she is doing the many things put on the shelf while Johnson was alive. 
“ I had the opportunity to help Lyn­ don, which was a heck of a lot more than I could ever do. and it was an all-absorbing life,” she says. “ There were lots of things I hadn t done and I knew, perhaps with a little touch of sadness, that I was letting time slip away from me. When the time cam e, believe me, I set about doing them 

J a c k ie 
K e n n e d y , though still G a rb o -lik e in h e r p u rsu it o f p r i­ vacy, now h a t a w o rk ­ ing w o m a n ’s c a re e r a t a publishing house 

 with total delight.” 
_ 
Now 64, she is so busy that she carves out one month — April — in which she tries not to be committed to a chore. T h at’s when T exas is alive with winnowers. 
And she loves travel. “ I always knew 
I wanted to go to those fa r-aw a y places,” she said a while ago as she p rep a red for a three-w eek trip to 
Egypt. “ I always wanted to go down those rivers and explore those ancient civilizations...” and, she add ed , “ I especially wanted to sit by the fire and laugh wiih my grandchildren.” 
When Johnson died in 1973, a month after attending T ru m an ’s funeral, a flood of letters from other w idows flowed to Mrs. Johnson. She answered each one. Typical is a reply she sent to a woman in Pennsylvania: “ It’s easy to see we share not only sorrow and loss, but the blessings of many full and ful­ filling years with our husbands. We are am ong the w orld’s lucky ones, really, having had so much.” 
Screen 
Unless they choose otherwise, like 
Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Ford, a pro­ tective screen goes up around former first ladies; one that is d ifficult to penetrate. F am ily and frien ds hold their privacy a s sa c re d , and in te r­ views, if they are granted at all, are under a pledge of anonymity. 
That is especially true for Pat Nixon. 
C asa Pacifica, the Nixon estate at 
San Clemente, is protected on one side by a uniformed guard and on the other by cliffs, the sea and the Secret Ser­ vice. Telephone calls to the sm all Nix­ on staff go unanswered. 
Last July 8. just hours after the New 
York state appeals court disbarred her husband, word cam e that Mrs. 
Nixon had suffered a stroke. She was severely handicapped—left arm and leg p araly zed , sp eech im p a ire d . A program of therapy was begun. 
“ She’s really had a rem arkable re­ covery,” says a friend. 
From that conversation and others, this p ictu re e m e rg e s: She still un­ dergoes therapy but now walks unaid­ ed. There still is a problem with her left arm . but her speech is good. At first, the therapist stayed in the house, now she goes to him once or twice a week. She is often on the grounds tak­ ing care of the garden. She m anages the household, instructing the live-in help, Manolo and Fina Sanchez. 
She goes to departm en t sto res to shop. She regrets that she can’t answer the estimated half million letters she received. The task is too great, there is not enough money. She doesn’t m iss the White House but feels there were a lot of things left undone. 
C ou rag e m a rk s M rs. Nixon m ore than anything else, her friends say: 
“ She could have easily given up after the strok e becau se they have been through so much ... But she has never felt sorry for herself in her life and isn t doing it now.” 

In Independence, Mo., the big Vie- torian house at the in tersection of 

On her last d ay as First Lady, 
Ford a t the W h ite House 
T ru m an Road and D elaw are is un­ changed from the days when the 33rd 
President of the United States would come out for his morning paper and walk. In the lib ra ry on the ground floor, Mrs. Trum an reads her beloved mysteries. She is thin but healthy. She has arth ritis iii the right knee and walks with a cane. She has no live-in help, but over her protests that it is unseemly to have a man in the house, a 
Secret Service agent sits up all night in the parlor. 
Mrs. T rum an ’s concession to age—at the insistence of daughter M argaret 
Daniel—is in sleeping on the first floor. 
“ She goes to the hair dresser, things like that,” says Margaret, who spent a week in Independence when Mrs. Tru­ man celebrated her 92nd birthday in 
F eb ru a ry . “ When the w eather gets warmer, she will go out for drives. I was rather appalled that she even went to the hair dresser the other day be­ cause it was five below zero.” 
The winter cold, says a friend, made 
M rs. T r u m a n feel c a g e d . H er old bridge club is no more; its m em bers either have died or are in nursing homes. But she spends much time on the telephone, answers her mail, reads the newspapers and occasionally goes out to dinner at a nearby steak house. 
When she ventures out, the Secret 
Service is with her. For the agents, headquartered across the street in a house filled with closed circuit tele­ vision receivers, it is quiet duty. In the last two years, says detail chief Robert 
Lockwood, four or five of his men have earned m asters degrees in criminology from Central Missouri State at nearby 
Warrensburg.

'You have to keep hustling 

ASSOCIATED WIESS 
NEW YORK - Do gentlem en still prefer blondes? Ani­ ta Loos, who created the durable tale of man’s weakness for fair hair a half a century ago, says no. 
“ It’s ch an ged , and I think it’s w o m en ’ s lib that’s done it... They’ve spoiled the whole ra c k ­ et,” says Miss Loos. 
“ Now men are wary. 
They back aw ay from blondes. The w o m en ’s lib bers got the idea of getting up on soap boxes and saying that women are sm arter than men. 
“ And we are. But we should keep our mouths shut.” 
Anita Loos, 4 feet ll and going on 84, talked profusely during an in­ terview in her Manhattan a p a rtm en t w here she w orks every m o rn in g, sifting through her files and id e as. H er third memoir. “ Cast of Thou­ s a n d s ,’ ’ h as ju st been published and she now is w riting abou t the Tal- m adge siste rs, Dorothy and Constance. 
“ Who can affo rd to retire?” she a sk s, eyes sn a p p in g behind o v e r­ sized su n glasse s. “ You have to keep hustling. I started off intrigued with money, and I never was able to overcome this.” 
2oo 
M iss L o os, s p a r r o w ­ like and well preserved, has written m ore than 
2oo screenplays, novels, plays and musicals. 
During three decad es in Hollywood her works have been the vehicle to stardom for the likes of 
Douglas Fairbanks, Jean 
Harlow, Clark Gable, Ca­ rol Channing and Audrey 
Hepburn. 
But she may be fhe last 

 of her breed. She says the day of the screenwriter is past. ‘‘This is the day of the director. It changed when directors got better and found out they could do their own films better than anyone else. For in­ stance, Lina Wertmiller. 
Certainly no writer could ever write her films the way she does. 
‘ ‘ I think any one of 
Woody Allen’s films is a work of art. and a great many of the French films are, too. A llen’s ‘Love and Death’ is one of the most profound critiques of Russian literature ever done. Underneath all the idiotic jokes is an entire 
Russian culture that he has risen above." 
M iss Loos began her career as a child actress in San Francisco, a na­ tural bent for the daughter of a man who divided his time between the newspaper business and the theater. She soon turned to writing scenar­ ios for D W. Griffith. 
Money 
“ The day came w hen I could make more money in half an hour of writing than in a week in the th e ate r,” she sa y s. “ I decided this is where I spend my tim e." 
“ G entlem en p re fe r 
B lo n d e s,” the lig h t­ hearted story of a light­ headed Lorelei Lee who knows that diamonds are a girl’s best friend, is her best-known work. 
“ I think I wrote that book b ec a u se 
I w as jealous of a blonde," says the once very brunette 
Miss Loos. “ No, I wasn’t jealous. I didn’t want to be like her. 
I w as resentful of the stupidity of the men who fell for her. I said TTI fix her’ ... but how she fixed me! I mean she fixed m e for lif e .” lf Miss Loos isn’t fond 

 of her blonde’s flapper tactics, neither does she like the macho image of men. Her idea of a sexy man is one of authority. 
“ I’d rather meet Ben 
Franklin than any other m an in h isto r y ,” she says. “ Ile never looked like anything but a fat, bald man, but he was the b ig g e st se x p o t that 
A m erica h as ever produced." 
Emerson 
She w as m a r r ie d to 
John E m erson , the d ir­ ector. She sa y s he was the weak partner, but she remained with him to the end. in clu din g his 16 y ea rs in a sa n ita riu m . 
After their m a r r ia g e , they retired to New York in the late ’2os to enjoy the fortu n es of 
H ol­ lywood, but the crash of 
'29 drove them back to 
Southern California and 
Irving Thalberg’s MGM. 
For Thaiberg she wrote 
“ The 
R ed-H eaded 
Woman.” which vaulted 
Harlow to fa m e , and 
“ San F r a n c i s c o ” and 
“ Blossoms in the Dust.” 
M e m o rie s of the 16 years she spent at MGM and the people she en ­ 

 countered fill “ C asts of 
Thousands.” Of F. Scott 
F itz g e ra ld she sa y s: 
“ The st r a n g e s t thing about Fitzgerald was that he had only one ambition in life, and that was to write motion pictures. He was so far above anyth­ ing he aim ed at, and it really was a tragedy of his life that he never got a script on film.” 
Of 
A ldous 
H uxley: I 
“ The trouble with Aldous is that once in a while a genius isn’t very sm a rt." 
Of Th aiberg: “ Irv in g ’s insistence on a love affair in every story posed som e pretty stiff p ro b ­ l e m s .” And of those w riters who b ec a m e fam ou s d u rin g the 
McCarthy era: 
‘Bore’

San Antonio EXPRESS-N EW S— Sunday March 2o 1977 
Meo losing to Reds 

 fr*il I n t o l l i a p n e p / 
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TJDORN, Thailand 
— Meo tribesmen of 
Laos, who made up a 
U.S.-trained force in the Indochina war, are being driven from their mountain villages by Laotian 
Communist forces in an attempt to break their traditional re­ sistance to central authority, according to eyewitnesses and other sources. 
Refugees, 
Western missionaries and other sources in Laos and 
Thailand say the govern­ ment's military and re­ settlement campaign against the Moos could destroy their traditional customs and ways. 
The Meo continue to attack government sol­ diers, ambush convoys and cut roads in Laos, the sources said. 
Pilots defecting from the 
Laotian air force tell of air strikes and ground attacks against the Meo and other hill tribe \ il- lages. The pilots say the government attacks are driving some of the Meo deeper and higher into 

 fS o m etim es J c rie d . The g o v ern m en t brought them down but gave them noth in g ’ 

 remote regions. 
The sources generally agree that the Meo, who suffered enormous ca­ sualties fighting the 
Communists in the Indo- china-confliet, now are probably putting up the greatest resistance to 
Communist rule in Indo­ china, but that their struggle is futile in the longrun. 
Worse 
With travel for news­ men and diplomats in 
Laos sharply restricted, it is difficult to deter­ mine the extent of the 
Meo insurgency or that of lowland Laotians in the southern panhandle. But from all indications, the general security for the government has wor­ sened this year. 
In Vientiane, average 
Laotians now speak re­ spectfully, and with greater openess, about the rebels, and they are persistent reports of in­ surgent attacks closer to the capital than ever before. 
Official sources in 
Vientiane reported last 

 ffiCaryos fa ffocfe 

 week that King Savang 
Vatthana and three other members of the fallen royal family had been jailed by the government for alleged involvement in rebel activities. 
A 3o-year-old pilot, who defected to Thailand ear­ lier this year, said in an interview here that he and several companions flew as many as six to seven missions a day in 
1976 and early 
1o77 against Meo military as well as civilian villages. 
The American-trained 
Lt. Bounmy Mekhag- nomdara said he flew his last mission Ja n . 
17 against a 2o-hut village 
8,ooo feet up in the rugged Phou San area, 
13o miles northeast of 
Vientiane. “ I made two sorties, firing 16 rockets in all. The village was suspected of having some rebels,” he said. “ Two days later I flew my plane out of Laos. I didn't want to kill Meo any more." 
Reports 

Debriefing reports of several other pilot defec­ tors, made available in 
Bangkok, in general matched that of Bounmy and some independent intelligence and refugee reports. 
The pilots said Laotian ground forces would move into some villages, burning homes and crops and killing livestock. The inhabitants then would be brought into the low­ lands. Late last year 
Vientiane officials said about 35,oo6 people had been resettled from their traditional homes in the mountains. 
“ In Yang Vieng (75 miles north of Vientiane on the edge of the mountains) I talked to the Mens, and sometimes 
I cried,” Bounmy said. 
“ They had nothing. The government brought them down but gave them nothing.’* 

I lie pilots maintained that North Vietnamese were operating with 
Communist Pathet Lac u lilts against the Meo and other resistance groups in some areas, but ap­ parently more in advi­ sory and logistics sup­ port roles than i i i actual combat. 
One former o23 tran­ sput pilot who defected last December said he flew men, ammunition and artillery to combined 
Pathet Lao and V ie t­ namese units involved in anti-Meo operations, and also made regular runs to Hanoi to bring back equipment, supplies and sometimes ammunition. 
Another pilot produced 
Hanoi airport visas which he said were stamped in his passport when he ferried supplies to Laos and brought 
Laotian cadre for training in 
Vietnam.

 tion that these may have 
Peen reinforced late last year. 
The Meo resistance, calling itself “ the Armed 
Force of the Sky God to 
Liberate Laos.” is armed with U.S.-made weapons and ammunition appar­ ently hidden before the 
Communist victory in 
1975 and with whatever it can capture from oppo­ nents. But one diplomatic source in Bangkok said, 
“ Unless they get sub­ stantial aid from some­ where — and this is most ii nlikely — they are doomed.” 
The pilots and refugees interviewed say the Meo fight in small groups from 15 to 3o men, mov­ ing among the fam iliar craggy mist-shrouded mountains that rise as high as 9,ooo feet. “ The 
Meo always strike first and the Pathet Lao die first,” is a oft-quoted re­ sistance motto. 
The Meo resistance is reportedly concentrated in traditional homeland areas around the 
3,-5oo-foot Plain of Jars in 
Xieng 
Khouang 
Province, as well as in parts of Borikhane and 
Khammouane provinces. 
Reliable sources also report resistance activity in 
Luang 
Prabang province and in the Thai border province el 
Sayaboury. 

'Unless they get aid from som e­ where, they are doo m ed ’ 

The various sources a- gree that some areas n^ these provinces are simply not entered by government troops, who must also move in force along many roads inside or leading to the high­ lands. 
Moving 
Western missionaries working with Mens in refugee camps in 
Thailand say there is considerable back-and- forth movement across the frontier, with fresh escapees entering 
Thailand and others re­ turning to join the resis­ tance. 
“ They’ve got a tremendous bamboo telephone system going between Thailand and 
La o s," said 
Edgar 
“ Pop” Buell, the Amer­ ican farmer who went to 
Laos in 196o and spent 14 years working with the 
M e n 
“ But their leaders are gone. It’s going to be hard for the Meo to sur­ vive as a group. The Meo structure like I knew it w ill disappear. It has to.” Refugees say a large number of Meo were sent to re-education camps and that many are still inside them, especially those who were known or thought to be part of the 
Meo “ secret arm y” led by Gen. Yang Pan and paid to fight the Pathet 
Lao and north Viet naniese by the U.S. C en 

 tral Intelligence Agency. 
One former fighter said he spent eight months at various labor and re-education camps before escaping. At one time he said he was with 
1,ooo other former Yang 
Pao soldiers and claimed all who showed signs of dissent were sent off and never returned. The in­ mates of the camp said they believed they had been executed, but had no proof. 
Buell and others who know the Meo well say the resistance is not based on ideology but on a fierce desire to remain independent, maintain their own tightly-knit 
“ kingdom,” grow opium aud live in the moun­ tains.

Caddie says the number of entries has soared over- lust year — from 2oo to

Court action stops rash of complaint 

A prison parolee or­ dered by a counselor to wear diapers was within his rights to leave a half­ way house, Florida's 4th 
District Court of Appeals has ruled. 
The opinion written by 
.Judge Gavin Letts said 
Devon Dale- Bien/, did not violate, his parole by leaving. A Fort Lau ­ derdale court had earlier convicted Bietz of parole violation. 
“ It is not the function 
,of this court to probe the 
Freudian recesses of a psychotherapist s mind, 

 if indeed, it could ever be done," Letts said Friday. 
"Suffice it to say that a command from a thera­ pist that an adult male wear diapers in public would certainly be de­ meaning lh the ‘minds of reasonable men." 
The court said Bien/ was ordered to wear a diaper on the outside of his pants because, in the words of his counsel at the halfway house, "his attitude reflected the ac­ tions of a baby." 
Bien/ left the house that night. He called his probation officer the next day saying he had left because he did not want to suffer the embarrass­ ment. 
The eourt said Bien/ had been told by his parole supervisor to obey all rules and regulations at the halfway house but that he could leave if he was asked to do anything menial or demeaning.

"They’re going to peo­ ple who really didn’t ex­ pect to get on e," Ph il 
C’hicola, a DNO staff worker said Friday. 

Some cam paign workers groused in Ja n ­ uary about not being in­ vited. Larry Kieves, in- auguaral committee exe­ cutive director, acknow­ ledged that the mailing

Although elephant manure is Albert’s favorite fertilizer and fuel, lie suggests zebra manure as a close second. Those without access to either animal can make do with horse manure, and 
Albert suggested that racetracks could heat grandstands that way. Commercial producers of chickens or eggs could even use the drop­ pings of the chickens to heat the coops.

I wrote to you in the latter part of January about not being paid for working as an extra in a movie filmed here in Kerrville. At that tim e I also forwarded to you a letter from the movie company stating we would be paid within three weeks.

The Bountiful Production Co. of Hollywood has not come through with their payment of $25 per students for the day’s work filming the movie “Willie” in 
Kerrville on Nov. 1ft. 1976. 
A letter was received in the middle of January aplogizing for the delay and promising payment in three weeks. I. the parent of one student, wrote to them Feb. 12 and haven’t received any acknow­ ledgement whatsoever. 
They surely have lost the faith of all these students and wonder if they will ever pay. Action-Express works miracles! How about this one?

We would like to work a miracle, but we would have to go over the heads of people at the Texas 
Attorney General’s office and others who are working on this problem. 
Action-Express con­ tacted the Texas Film 
Commission in Austin and they were painfully aware of the snafus ex­ perienced by Texans who worked in the movie 
•Willie." 
The film commission. which actively recruits film com panies to do work in Texas, has in­ formed Bountiful Pro 

 duetions they are not welcome in Texas for any further ventures and people will be warned about their poor record in paying help if they ever pay up and resume work in Texas. 
Action-Express advises all the Kerrville folks to contact either the nearest office of the Texas Attor­ ney General or the State 
Labor Department and explain in full all the problems you have encountered in getting paid. 
That is the best course of action at this point. 
Lion al Bullm oose 
We ate at the new restaurant “The Bull Moose” which had lion’s meat on the menu. 
They assured us it was really lion s meat 
Can you find out about this for us and make sure they weren’t pulling our legs? 
M M 
“ Be assured it is lion's meat," says Bob 
Ragan, manager of the new eatery. 
Ile cites the difficulty a local fish company had with the attorney general, and says, 
“ We’re not about to get in that sort of trouble," he said. 
The lion is loin and hind quarter sauteed in wine with vegetables and served over rice. That platter sells fur .about 
$1o.5o. 
The Bullmoose also has som e other unusual treats for San Antonio restaurant goers, by the way — like real Rocky 

Mountain rainbow trout, shark, elk. deer lasagna, quail, duck, buffalo, frog legs, rack of lamb, pork tenderloin and other goodies. 
Elephant is coming later. There is the usual variety of beef steaks, of course. 

We have gotten some 
“ review s" back from people who have tried the lion and they said it was delicious. Reports are it tastes very close to beef with a slight ham under­ tone. 
All of this should give local gourmands someth­ ing to talk about for a few months.

W AYNE A. ECCLES 

Mr. Eccles is the vice f resident of Advanced elephone, which is lo­ cated at 599 W . Rhap­ sody. 
Ile says that persons with malfunctioning pri­ vate telephones may take them out to Advanced and they will fix it at the rate of $15 per hour. The company has been in bu slness about two years. 
However, we must tell people who do NOT own 

 their own phones, or even if they have bought their own Design Line phones from Southwestern Bell 
Telephone Co., Bell will fix any malfunctioning telephone for free as long as it is Bell equipment. 
So phone users do have a choice 
—privately owned phones with ser­ vice provided by Ad­ vanced. or Bell phones with free service from

Business is booming in Ray Ellison areas 

Business is booming at Ray 
Ellison's six subdivisions sur­ rounding San Antonio, and tho management team at Ray El- lison I louies believes the pheno­ menal sales figures during the first 2'v months of 1977 w ill continue throughout the year. 
Acronlmu; In Ii I. Maurer, director of marketing for Hay Ellison Homes, sales figu res for la n u a ry and Ke- bruar> are running loiter liian double the I UTU rate fur the same months, and actual sales are exceeding sales pro­ jections for I‘*77 bv substantial m ar­ gins 
_________ 

“ W e've always believed that we're dealing with a sophisticated buyer. " 
M au ler said. “ but this year really proves the point. People are looking at the overall housing situation across the nation and looking at the inflation that s affecting materials like lumber and bricks, and they're deciding that, if they're going to buv at all, they'd better do it this year. before the price of a new home really does go out of reach for the average homobuyer." 
Maurer pointed out that the situation 

 iii San A n to n io is much more favorable regarding the prices of new homes than elsew here in the country but sounded a note of caution as lie indi­ cated an average inflation rati* of about a half of I per cent per m o n th i ii th is 

 area. 
“ There s been an awful lot of static in the mass media about new homes being out of reach for the average hom ebuyer. but it s apparent that people here aren't ready to believe that," Maurer said, “ at least, not yet." 
Maurer pointed out that a great deal of buyer confidence in the Ellison pro­ duct has been surfacing during the first months of H»77. 
“ We re certainly not bashful about the fact that we are volume builders. 
That’s the name of the game for u s , " 
Maurer said “ but. volume building to us isn t a dirty word. and it isn't to the consumer, either, because he knows that Kav Ellison has really mastered the art of volume building, lie s put 

Tanglewood is one of six major communities of new homes by Ray Ellison which are located in the 
San Antonio areas where new home sales are roughly double 1976 rates. Buyer confidence in the Ellison product plus choice locations around 

 the city are only part of the reason for the suc­ cessful year, and much of the credit must go to 
San Antonio's Realtor community, which prefers to bring their clients to Ray Ellison neighborhoods. 

 together a management learn over Un­ gears that knows how to apply the very latest in construction techniques and methods. 
“ And, buyers know that we know how to take full advantage of volume purchasing strategies when it comes to buying m aterials and supplies. Put verv simply, they know we're not going 

 to do it at the expense of quality. W e're building the best new homes in town in our price range, and it's a broader range than ever before. W e’re proud of that." 

M aurer said one of the strongest drawing features of all new Ray E l­ lison homes built since .January. 11*76 

 has been the exclusive Ellison energy package. 
"T o make, new home monthly pay­ ments lit the family budget," he said, 
“ people are looking with great interest at our energy package because it does cut utility bills significantly with nor­ mal Usage, and that makes a lot of sense to today's consumer."

TWO HEADS 
ARE BETTER 
TH AN ONE! 

REALTORS SELL OUR HOMES — AND LOTS OF THEM! 
That’s why realtors and Ray Ellison work hand in hand to sell Ray Ellison homes. This year, already proving to be a GREAT year for new home sales, all of us at Ray Ellison Homes are first to acknowledge that the professional real estate community is a key ingredient in the successful sale of new 
Ray Ellison homes. 

REALTORS WON T WORK WITH JUST MI BUILDER. 
Realtor reputations are often linked to the kinds of builders and new homes they offer to prospective home buyers. They know that slipshod craftsmanship won't satisfy their customers and will hurt the real estate market in the long run. Thus, their preference for Ellison. 

REALTORS HAVE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE HOUSING MARKET. 
Many new home buyers who realize this fact consult real estate agents for the same reasons they consult their lawyers for legal advice and their physicians for medical aid — because the realtor is a professional with specialized experience, training and background. 

TWO OUT OF THREE NEW HOMES PURCHASED 
FROM RAY ELLISON DURING 1976 WERE 
PURCHASED THROUGH REAL ESTATE AGENTS! 
That’s certainly proof of the confidence that the realtor community has in Ray Ellison Homes. It's also proof that realtors know Ray Ellison homes represent broad variety and diversified price ranges that answer clients’ individual needs and preferences.

SHOULD KNOW:

Ray Ellison is proud to be part of a preferred team offering home buyers MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE in location, in product, and in value! And that’s why realtors will continue to introduce prospective home buyers to new Ray Ellison homes!

Valencia. It’s an all new part of the neighborhood and it's the cat's pajamas. 
Now, during the opening, we'll have 

(f&jy some of the jazziest homes on display this side of Casablanca. And they’ll be decorated by some of San Antonio’s top interior designers. So you can see what you're getting into. It's swell. So be there. 
We’re playing it again. 
Real Class. 

Listen sweetheart, the minute I saw Valencia I knew it was a high class outfit. Real clean. And these homes give you everything you need to live in fine style. Like lots of room. 
With homes ranging from 15oo 

 to approximately 2ooo sq. ft. Terrific. 
But what's more important is that they live big. With oversized master bedrooms. Large living and family areas. And lots of storage space. Even bonus rooms. Now that’s swell. 
But class doesn’t always cost a lot. 
These beauties run from $38,ooo to 
$48,ooo. And with great extras like a one year written guarantee and a 
Home Owner’s Manual, a home in 
Valencia is a better find than the Maltese Falcon. 

Here s looking for you, kid. 

Hey kid, we’ll be looking for you during the big grand opening of 

One more time. And this time with even more pizzazz. The new part of Valencia has only Success 
Homes. Top of the line all the way. With a clubhouse, swimming pools, even tennis courts. 
It’s still Valencia. 
Just a new part. 
'Cause listen, when you played it so well the first time, it'd be a crime not to play it again. Come out and see what we mean.

Han't be surprised if someone tells you how great your Great America nome looks. Because at 
Great America, we believe you can see the difference quality makes. 
In our garden kitchens, with handfinished cabinets and top quality appliances. In our roomy living areas, with vaulted cathedral ceilings, built-in bookcases and Woodburn- mg fireplaces. In our lavish ceramic tile baths, with marble vanities and decorator appointments. 
Even in our generous mas­ ter suites, with private baths and walk-in closets. 
Everywhere you look, there is careful attention to design, styling, practi­ cality and energy-effi- ciency. 
But that's only the in­ side story. Outside, Great 
America homes are strik­ ingly individualistic. Each home is designed for its particular homesite. Some are traditional, others reflect the informality of 
California styling. Some have soaring rooflines, 

 cedar trim and second- story balconies. Others are simple, yet elegant. 
But all are equally suited to entertaining and day- to-day family living. 
You'll find these really great homes in San 
Antonio's finest com­ munities. In Northwest 
San Antonio, we have new homes in Park Forest,

Panoramic 
Enter a Great America home to the breathtak­ ing. panoramic view of a spacious living area with brick-crafted fireplaces and soaring ceilings which may extend beyond second-story liv­ ing areas or indoor bal­ conies. Generous panels of glass merge the envir­ onment and the home in­ to one airy, open living concept. 
Natural utilization of space by the 
Great 
America home designers elim inates the four- walled, closed-tn feeling of conventional housing. 
Instead, a Great America home may center life ar­ ound an enormous family living area adjacent to the breakfast nook and kitchen and with easy access to outdoor patios, pools and garden lands­ caping. 
Formal living and din­ ing areas — many with built-in buffets, cabinets and glass-doored upper cabinets for display — lie to the opposite side of the kitchen, creating a com­ plete walk-through serv­ ing area perfect for home entertaining. 
This unstructured feeling of extended living space is found among the bedrooms and m aster suite, all tucked away from traffic areas for privacy and many with sloped ceilings, glass- paneled walls arid indoor or outdoor balconies overlooking great views or livin g areas below.

An annual interest rate as low as 7L> per cent will be offered with VA financing for selected homes in all Homecraft Corp. residential areas this weekend. 
As well. VA financing which requires a total niove-in cost of only $1 can apply to many home purchases in Homecraft communities ranging from northwestern Bexar County all the way up to Comal and Guadalupe Counties. 
Models showing 
Luxury features of Homecraft houses are dis­ played in the models shown in each neighborhood. 
They include appointments like woodburning fire­ places completely handcrafted, boxed windows, wooden cabinetry, fine carpeting, color-coordinated wallcoverings and all-electric kitchens with dish­ washers, disposers and Magic Chef ranges with continous-clean ovens. 
Other fine features of Homecraft houses are pa­ tios, room-finished two-car garages with overhead doors, accent paneling and sculptured front doors. 
These homes also boast features that exemplify the real meaning behind Homecraft’s recent housing concept, the "Snug Home.” 
"Snug Hom e" is a term Homecraft chose to briefly describe the solid construction of its UM) per cent masonry homes. Although it sounds simple enough, there is much to it, especially when the need for modern families to save as much energy as possible is considered. The Snug Home accom­ plishes that with ease.

Twin Creek 
Twin Creek is the first of the Homecraft com­ munities for the San Antonio area. Situated between 
Bandera and Culebra Roads and off Grissom Road north of NAV Loop 41o, the northwestern Bexar 
County community has become the address of so many families that it now is considered one of the more established recent neighborhoods. 
Streets here necessitate slow traffic, and house exteriors along each create an impressive blending of both colors and styles. This shows how Homecraft plans its areas strictly on a professional basis. 
The community also features its own private clubhouse and amenity area. It offers green-sur­ faced, fenced tennis courts lighted at nights. Other facilities are a swimming pool, wading pool, club­ house with equipped kitchen and children's play­ ground. 
Although surrounded by nature, Twin Creek also has a location of utmost convenience. The thor­ oughfare Bandera Road is just a mile away; N VY 
Loop 41o. one mile more. 
Outside city limits, Twin Creek residents pay no city taxes with their home payments.

B R IA R W IC K m o d e ls Centennial sty lin g w ith others 
Briarwick models mean good news for home buyers 

The stampede of homebuyers that have been flocking to B r ia r­ wick, the new northeas­ tern community of fine homes by Royal Prest, is no surprise to Ed R i­ chardson, area sales manager for Briarw ick. 
“ Briarwick is the right place at the right time for a lot of families who really believe this is the year they've been waiting for to make the move to a new home.” Richardson said “ Briarw iek hap­ pens to be like one of those celestial events that happen once iii a blue moon 
— where everything conies to­ gether iii a perfect com­ bination that’s hard to duplicate.” 

Checklist 

Richardson pointed out that most families visit­ ing Briarwick are using a sort of mental checklist to come up with the fea­ tures they’re looking for 
— and all the checkpoints are coming up positive. 
‘ They want fine homes at reasonable prices. with extra amenities like fireplaces and m i­ crowave ovens and fine quality carpeting.” he 

 said, “and, they’re sur­ prised when they find features like that are standard in practically every home we sell 
Briarw ick’s prime lo-. cation, five miles north of 
N E Loop 41o, places it within the excellent 
North East School Dis­ trict vet beyond the reach of city taxes, giving fa­ m ilies the benefits of outstanding educational programs and the ease of lower monthly mortgage payments. 
The quality built into every Briarwick home is ev ident, not only in the exterior masonry but al­ so iii the interior finish­ ing touches. The price tag is appealing not only to young families looking for their first homes but. as well, to more estab­ lished homemakers ready to step up to a more contemporary life­ style 
Briarwick homes’ paneled dens, with soar­ ing cathedral ceilings and brick- or stone-front fireplaces, are perfect cathedral ceilings and brick- or stone-front fire­ places, are perfect for evening relaxation or en­ tertaining. while back­ yard patios are perfect 

 for the barbecue week­ ends on the horizon. 
Thermostatically con­ trolled central heating and air condittoning de­ liver an energy-efficient wallop because the units are teamed with an en­ ergy package designed to cut energy consumption dramatically, whether in the heat of Summer or the coldest of W inter days 

Included iii the energy package is wall and ceiling insulation that exceeds 
V A /KH A standards, turbine roof vcntilator. interlocking thresholds and special caulking designed to halt infiltration of outside air; and. iii most models, even double-plane win­ dows designed to make the Briarwick home snug and cozy, no matter what the weatherman dictates

W hile many San An­ tonio builders address themselves to the en­ ergy-efficient home now that they’re in the face of spiraling utility costs, the Burns Co. began de­ signing energy-efficient homes to seriously re­ duce energy waste within homes as many as four years ago. 
And, while many builders are adding extra insulation and double glass windows. Burns set out to tackle the biggest energy-waster of all — air infiltration. 
‘Unnecessary' 
Air infiltration is the unnecessary movement of air into or out of your home. W hile some air movement occurs in dai­ ly activities, such as en­ tering or leaving through a door, the overwhelming percentage escapes or enters due to loose con­ struction techniques. 
Tests have proven that up to JI per cent of your cooling and heating costs can be attributed to the effects of air infiltration. 
As new air moves into 
.our home. it must be recooled or reheated. 
Eventually, all the air in the room w ill be re­ placed. 
While one change of air per room each hour is reasonable (some older homes have a rate of four changes of air per hour), the average Burns home changes air only once every two hours. 
This rem arkable de­ crease in infiltration rate is brought about by the extra time and effort that goes into the construction of a Burns Co. “ Dower 
Saver’’ home. Each step of construction includes energy-conserving tech­ niques to seal out air in­ filtration. Extra insula­ 

 tion and double glass windows are standard, as are power ventilators. 
Although 9o per cent of the added energy-saving techniques are invisible in a completed home, the difference they make will be clearly visible on your monthly utility bill 
From top to bottom aud from inside out, every Burns home is built to meet strict en- ergy-efficiency stan­ dards. And, while this is a major concern of the 
Burns Co., it never neg­ lects the styling or liva­ bility of the home. 
The “ Power S a ve r” homes collection features exciting options to suit any lifestyle. Handsome living areas with deep- 

CLAESFFMO DFEPtAV 

 pile carpeting and turni- ture-finished paneling an* planned around sun­ ken conversation pits or more traditional plans. 
All include woodburning fireplaces and built-in bookcases. Some models feature a roll-out TV ca­ binet, completely anten­ na-wired, under the stair landing. 
Spacious m aster be­ drooms include separate dressing areas and walk-in closets. Built-m alcoved beds with mat­ tresses. draw er space and toy storage are op­ tional in some upstairs children’s bedrooms. 
Extra features are found in the “ wife saver” kitchen areas, too. Many become fam ily activity 

 centers, some with up­ dated versions of the breakfast nook popular in the 192os. The modern plan features built-in seating with shelved plant windows and niches for greenery. 
The Burns Co. invites all prospective home buyers in San Antonio to see the advantages of owning a "Pow er Saver” home. Burns Co. repre­ sentatives will be happy to show interested per­ sons homes under con­ struction to point out power-saving techniques invisible in a completed home. Sales offices are open in The Great North­ west and Hidden Forest daily except Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m. ,

Complex 
‘legend’ lives on 

It started with Indian legend, and, by now, 
Moonpnint has become a romantic blend of nostal­ gia and contem porary luxury. 
Quiet, moonlit nights, the flickering glow of gas lamps by the rippling pool, a fireside chat with friends at the club and the many-windowed splendor of homestyle apartments that points up the bright side of life each day yield a special charm at Moonpoint. 
Decorated 
Superb in detail, yet popularly priced, ihe 
“ lodgehouse and model apartment designs are refreshingly decorated. 
A visit to Moonpoint is made especially worthwhile to everyone who is a designer at heart because of the simplicity and dram atic touches developed just for these 

 striking floor plans. 
Moonpoint has been an unusual success etory, particu larly in the numbers of people who have found their way to the 4515 Gardendale Dr. address and made it their home. The property is located just off Wur/bach 
Road between NAV. Ill IO and 
Fredericksburg 
Road in the high place above Turtle Creek. 
It is interesting to note that most of the new re­ sidents at Moonpoint are the kind of steady, relia­ ble and thinking people usually found to be the kind of neighbors one likes to have next door. 
There's a lot to like at 
Moonpoint, and you can find out more by visiting one of the friendly Moon­ point people at 4515 Gar­ dendale Dr. off Wurzbach 
Road between NAV. Ill IO and 
Fredericksburg 
Road.

Energy crisis’ housing effect has committee 

SPfCIAl TO TMI GOLDEN TWINS 
A special committee to assess the im pact that the nation's continuing energy s h o r t a g e s will have on the im p o rta n t housing industry and the m ort­ gage lending institutions which support it has been created by the United States Leagu e of 
Savings Associations. 
The com m ittee, scheduled to m eet 
Thursday and Friday, M arch 24 and 
25. in Washington, D C. is expected to make recommendations which can be incorporated into the federal energy program. 
Unveil energy proposals 
The Carter Administration plans to 

 jill veil its energy proposals April 2o. 
The United States League is the pri­ m ary trad e association serv in g the 
Km billion s a v in g s and loan business. 
• Savings associations are the nation’s number one providers of home m ort­ gage financing. 
Chairing the League’s special energy com m ittee will he Richard I-. Bryan, president of Des Moines (Iow a) Sav ­ ings 
S ta ff a s s o c ia te for the new c o m ­ m ittee will he Harold Olin, the U.S. 
League’s director of architectural and ti inst m et ion research 
" T h e r e is little doubt that energ y conservation will he an important part nUeveryone’s future,” League P r e s i­ dent .John A. Hardin said in announc­ ing the com mittee appointments. 
"W e expect to see m ore strin gen t energy standards for new housing, and there a re broad indications that the 
C a r te r A d m in istration hopes to e n ­ courage owners of existing homes to improve the energy efficiency of those homes.” Hardin said. 

"B u t we must he certain that energy conservation program s are carried out in such a way as to be equitable to all people," the League president empha­ sized. 
M ortg ag e le n d e r s a re co n cern ed about ways to help owners of existing homes upgrade the energy efficiency of their buildings, Hardin said, and added, 
‘ ‘C e r t a in ly , sa v in g s associations will he able to help with some home improvement programs in which the homeowner apparently will have little choice in the m anner or financing of those improvements." 
Hardin pointed out that the savings and loan business’ concern about en­ ergy dates hack to 1973, when the U.S. 
League adopted policy standards for new buildings and advocating the 
"therm al upgrading of existing build­ ings through improved attic insulation, double glazing of windows and effec­ tive weatherstripping." 
S ta ff a s s o c ia te for the new c o m ­ mittee will be Harold Olin, the U.S. 
League’s director of architectural and construction research 
Olin is editor of the “ Construction 
Lending Guide,” an encyclopedic work used in business and educational c ir ­ cles on the design, planning, construc­ tion and appraisal of residential pro­ perties. He is also the principal anilau of ‘‘Construction Principles, Materials and M e th o d s ,” a m a jo r r e f e r e n c e source for lenders, builders, architects and students of building technology. 
Olin has been active in a variety of environmental and conservation ac­ tivities for several years. 
Com mittee m e m b e rs include Gary 
Driggs, president. Western Savings, 
Phoenix, A ri/.; Donald J . S ch a efer, p re s id e n t, F i r s t F e d e r a l S a v in g s,

The Kind's wife may not be the 
Queen. but she is Mistress of the 
Robes in San Antonio's upcom­ ing Fiesta. 

Mrs. .lack Lewis .lr., the Coronation's 
Mistress of the Robes, is m arried to 
K in g Antonio L IV , the C a v a lie r s ’ reigning monarch until the Investiture of King Antonio LY April It). 
In the Order of tin1 Alamo s Corona­ tion of the Queen in Municipal Audi­ torium April ‘id. M rs. Lewis will watch thi“ lavish costumes she has designed 
"c o m e to life ” in the Court of the 
Voyage Extraordinaire. 
The name of the court was taken from the o rig in a l title of .lilies V e rn e ’s 
"Around the World in Kl) D ays.” The e lab o rate robes the 
14 in-town duchesses and ill out-of-town duchesses w ea r w ill portray events or c itie s 
Verne’s characters might have seen on that great adventure in his lighter than air balloon. 
The theme lends itsell to all sorts of gaiety and fun. and spectators at the 
Coronation will be taken “ on the voyage they've alw ays im agined.” says W il­ liam Jeffers Jr ., Coronation chairman. 

( Iou ii art ist 

 lie asked Mrs 
Lewis, the form er 
Peggy Wolff, tube Mistress of the Robes last October and Mrs. Christopher (L in ­ da) (ioldsbury -Jr. to be court artist in 
November. 
Researching costume possibilities began iii earnest, and by January Linda was m aking sketches. M rs. Lew is looked through so many books, she was almost hidden behind them at times. 
John Palm er Peeper, director of the 
McNav Art Museum, got busy writing the script, and the 
24 duchesses were selected. The in-town members were invited to a Sketch Party in the 
Argy Ie. and each was privately read her introduction to the Court by Howard 
Ferguson, the Lord High Chamberlain. 
The duchesses w ere also shown sketches of their gowns, swatches of the fabrics, and the reference books that inspired their costum es. 

Mrs, Lew is.and Mrs. (Ioldsbury had chosen the materials — satins, velvets, chiffons, lames, brocades and all the glittering stones — before the sketches were created. 

I i i fact. Mrs. Lewis said a lot of the fun in her job was working with all the textures and fabrics available and cor­ relating those that shine more than others to get the effect they wanted. 
The dressmakers began cutting the elaborate gowns immediately, pattern­ ing them after the sketches. Mrs. Lewis accom panied each duchess for the many fittings necessary. 
Members of the out-of-town court had visited Mrs, Lewis separately the week after the Sketch Party was held to see what their robes would look like. 

(.oui plated 

By the end of Jan uary, the first robe had been completed 
Five of the du­ chesses had been photographed in their costumes by early February. 
Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. (Ioldsbury also coordinated the costumes for the chil­ dren aged H-12. who will be pages iii the 
Coronation. Conferences took place with members of tin* Battle of Flowers As­ sociation to make sure the floats the duchesses would ride i i i the parade complemented the costumes. 
The duchesses begun practicing their floor-sweeping bows each Saturday beginning the latter part of February at 
Loleta llag y’s School of Dancing. Bow practice will continue right up to the 
Saturday before Fiesta Week except for 
Holy Week. 

The Coronation stage set is being designed by Peter Wolf and Associates of Dallas. The court logo will be the lighter than air balloon taken from the fabulous around the world voyage. 

Appropriate music for each locale in which the balloon lands will In* played by tin* San Antonio Sym phony with 
Roger Meiotic conducting. Tickets for the Coronation will go on sale March 28 at Municipal Auditorium, the location of th»i Coronation. 
Al tilt' pageant April 2o. Mrs Lewis will get to see — along with everyoiu rn tin1 audience — how well her ideas have boon earned out. 
Mrs. Lewis' background for Misti ess of the Robes includes hours of art his­ tory and interior design courses she took in e arn in g her B S. degree in hom em aking from the U n iversity of 
Texas. Previously, she had graduated from Alamo Heights High School. 

C h arity Hall 

I he hours she has spent iii art mu­ seums also stood her in good stead, along with her travels. Mrs. Lew is enjoys cooking "everything that s fat­ tening” . gardening, and painting a r­ ound Hie house. 

Currently, she is on the board of the 
Charity B all Association and a new member of tin' Battle of Flowers Asso­ ciation. She is a former president of the 
San A ntonio Ju n io r Leag u e, and a member of Delta Delta Delta Alumnae. 
B o a rd s she has served include the 
Southwest Research Foundation Forum and till' Harry Jersig Speech and Hear­ ing Center . 
Mr. and Mrs Lewis have three chil­ dren. Ja c k IIL a student at St. M ary’s 
Law School; Steve, a freshman at the 
University of Texas; and Laurie, fresh­ man at Mount Vernon College in W a ­ shington. D C . 
Along w itll all the time im oh cd in her position as Mistress of the Robes. M is

Pintsize artists say it with paint 

Don’t bt* an art critic — even a favorable one — when your c h ild ’s work is con­ cerned. 

According to (lay Jones Judson, director of the Montessori Work­ shop. any response that implies judgement may allect the child's self-expression as the child tries to please Ins or her audience. 
"It s hest to react to a particular part of the work by saying how it makes the parent feel or how un­ ique it is.” she said. 
.Mrs. Ju d so n ex p lain e d that w h atev er a child does is worthwhile. "T he importance is what happens within the child as lie or she does it. not i i i how people react," she added 
Art 
Mrs- Judson, who also teaches at the San Antonio Art Institute’s 
C hildren,s C reative W orkshop, noted that art can be much more than a part-time activity for chil­ dren. 
She explained that by encourag­ ing children to express themselves through art, p aren ts can help overcome some of the negative effects of the overstimulation that occurs from extensive TV watch­ ing 
She will join Dr. Pamela Dalton, 
UTSA assistant professor of early childhood and elementary education, Thursday in teaching 
•Creative Expression Through 
Art," a UTSA Division of Contin­ uing Education course. 
The course will help parents and teachers learn how to encourage creativity and self-expression in children. The class will meet in the San Antonio Art Institute from 
7 to IO p.m. 
"Art is a self-discovery process. 
It s a creative encounter which perm its children lo learn what they like and what they don’t like, what they can do and what they can’t do It gives them the chance to develop on their own,” she said 

I )< *\< *lo m iic n t 

Mrs. Judson noted that from the tune a child is born, p aren ts should use their creativity to sti­ mulate the youngster’s healthy development 

"Learning and expression arc part of n atu ra l human development,” she said "Expres­ sion meets a natural need and if children don’t find it they will seek it out.” 
She noted that children who do not receive a creative outlet often express their needs through vio­ lence or repress their needs and become extremely passive. 
Mrs. Judsn recommends that parents introduce children to such media as clay, tem pera paints, water colors, weaving, collage, c a rd b o a rd co n s tru c tio n , and chalk. 
"The children either really get into the media or they may be very hestitant,” she said. She added that parents should take the time to work with the children, espe­ cially reluctant ones. 
"The child should not be made to feel that working with him ot­ her is a bother to the parent, but that it’s something that a parent and child can enjoy together," 
Mrs. Judson said. 

Parents should show the child how to manipulate the tools and then allow the child to develop his or her own skills," she said. She also noted that parents do not need to have a rtis tic ab ility to encourage self-expression among their children. 
VI <*«! i ii iii 
Mrs. Judson stressed the im ­ portance of a child’s selecting the medium in which he or she wants to work. 
• Parents should realize that it’s natural for children to use the same medium over and over," she said. "A s the children become more familiar with a medium they can b ette r express them selves through it." 

She also recommends that par­ ents set aside a place for the child to work. "This provides an oppor­ tunity to introduce the child to the discipline needed to care for the materials and the environment,” she said. 
According to Mrs, Judson, the child’s work should Im * displayed routinely and not on the basis of how good the work is. Parents may want to let the child select the work to be displayed.

Learning gets a booster shot 

(Iron — and I'm learning a lot at the same time about helping my own youngsters.” 
Margie Gongora had accepted an­ other job when a vacancy became available in the program. 
“ I've always wanted to do something like this, so I quit my other job and accepted a trainee job and I love it. 
I have a two year old daughter and 
I’m learning many things which wili benefit her as she grows up. 
“ Each unit covers simple basics all children need. They learn to cut, paste and color, they identify sounds, learn parts of the body and many other im­ portant concepts. And enjoy it all. 
“ The resource center is one of the most popular facets of the project. The books, toys and games all have hidden educational values. Many educational toys and books are expensive to buy.” 

( iasas 
Virginia Casas has a six and a four year old. She is a trainee, but her four year old is in the program and is being taught by Jean Gonzales. He was shy and needed self-discipline — good re­ sults are being seen 
“ Many husbands and fathers are also enthused about the project,” she says. 
“ My husband would like to set up a cr;;ft workshop for other fathers where toys and games to be used in learning could be made inexpensively. 
One father works with his child assisted by a trainee because his wife is working at that time. 
“ In this program, too, we discover children who need extra help, therapy or testing. The earlier a child with a learning disability is discovered the bigger the chance of helping that child.” 
Alejandero 
One trainer. Lydia Aleiandero. has lots of experience with children. The mother of ll children with eight in 
Storm Elementary, she has one son in the service and two daughters out of school. She has four grandchildren. 
“ One of the mothers in the program is deaf and her daughter interprets the lessons for her,” Mrs. Alejandero says. 
“ This project has made a difference in their home. 
“ Sometimes field trips are planned for mothers and children, so that they can experience new learning adven­ tures together. Some of these mothers are so used to being involved in day to day existence that they haven’t had a 
♦ hance to do simple things such as visiting the zoo or park.” 
Proyecto Parvulo attracts visitors from other districts and other cities. 
Each year improvements are made and pre-schoolers and families gel better help. Kindergarten welcomes children who are no longer education­ ally deprived due to home-environ- ment, heritage or economic status. 

 parents as teachers of pre-schoolers in the home. 
Storm was selected as a site for the program because. 
1. 'rho school has a large number of children from low income families. 
2. The school i$ in an area of high concentration of Mexican-Americans whose dominant language is Spanish 
3. The school is in an area where a large number of pre-schoolers reside. 
Proyecto Parvulo, roughly translated 
“ beginning project” was originally funded for five years and five parents 

Educators keep scratching their heads and trying out new methods on local youngsters. 
They find that some communi­ ties need specialized projects to meet unique situations. 

A pilot project of the San Antonio 
Independent School D istrict titled 
“ Proyecto Parvulo” is in its second year at Storm Elementary. Funded through federal Title V II (bilingual) monies, the project is basically using 

 have been hired trom the community. 
Jacob B iry , principal of Storm 
Elementary, is a booster of the suc­ cessful oroiect. 
Those working in the project are called parent-teachor trainers. They work in the kindergarten classes as auxiliaries for one-half day and then work in the community for the balance of the day, except when their time is scheduled for pre-service or in-service training programs. 
Parent trainers visit each p ar­ ticipating family once a week to teach a lesson chosen by the staff of the Par­ vulo Parental Involvement program. 
The Parvulo Parental Advisory 
Committee w ill develop the c u r­ riculum, select materials to be used in the program, recommend materials for the Resource Center for parents, appoint a member as executive officer and bv supervise the program 
Training of the “ trainees” is handled by Our Lady of the Lake University. 
Yolanda Molina is coordinator of the program After initial training, a full- bay inservice program is held once a month in the district bilingual office 
As a “ plus” byproduct of the project, many trainees are also inspired to improve their own personal education. 
Guerrero 
Diana Guerrero joined the trainees program “ to have something to do.” 
She had been active in PT A and parent volunteering and believed in helping the schools. She has three children, ll, 
IO and 7. 
“ It’s a good program," Diana says, 
“ It makes us feel so good to see shy children open up and be eager to learn and to talk to others. We sometimes design our own games or toys to make learning more fun. 
“ When we help in the kindergarten classes we can see that many of the children needed pre-kindergarten help. 
Ifs such a simple plan, encouraging parents to give their children that needed boost.” 
Gonzales 
Jean Gonzales, who is the mother of two children, ages 4 and I >/2. had worked off and on as a teacher’s aide and when Biry heard about the pro­ gram he asked her if she’d be interested. 
“ I hope this program spreads to other schools because it really works,” she says. 
“ Teachers can concentrate on teach­ ing. not preparing the children to learn. These little children are developing a good self image at an early age and that’s very important, 
“ The parents are learning the im­ portance of giving time to their chil-

It’s a season of newness. But happily not so new that you have to retire your present wardrobe to the back of the closet or the thrift shop. 
It’s a season of contrasts. Clean, softly tailored haberdashery looks on the one hand, and toned-down fantasy fashions on the other Inspired by the success of the posh fantasy clothes by

Paris is reviving the mini, but so far it’s pegged for beaches and back­ yards in this country. Nevertheless, keep your eye on the thigh.

Wish power vs. will 

MARY SLE MILLER 
] 
Most women think of overweight solely as a beauty problem But’ it really must be considered from an­ other viewpoint 
In medical circles, serious over­ weight is regarded as a menace to health, for it leads to the eventual impairment of many organs of the body. 
A reducing diet, therefore, has more than cosmetic value. It is a kind of health-insurance policy, too. 
And, keeping that fact in mind, what weighty woman would be so foolish as to let a diet lapse? 
Yet, every day, you hear a plump type say, “ I simply cannot stick with a diet ” 
W by, do you suppose'* Is it hunger that overcomes her or is it a lack of will p o w e r ? ______ 

Methinks she has m ore “ wish power” than will power. Her wish to pamper her appetite with caramels is greater than her will to discipline her weight. 
Tile question of hunger — the real thing — has been eliminated by ap­ proved diet regimes until privations go almost unnoticed. 
Keep active — get plenty of ex­ ercise and fresh air; both work to burn up reserve fat. After eating, move about for at least 15 minutes. 
Eat very slowly; that way, less food seems like a lot. 
Do remember that a morsel is on the tongue for only a second but remains on the hips for seasons.

Television is the topic 

Dear Ann Landers: 
We speak and read about all sorts of ad­ dictions in this day and age, but why isn't more said and written about the biggest addiction of all — television? 
No effort is made to try to solve the o rd in ary problems that occur in every household because 
“ the box” does all the talking. 
If an effort IS made, the p roblem m u st be r e ­ solved in 2o m in u tes, because 
“ Laverne and 
Shirley” is coming on. 
It’s like going to the show every night of your life, only you d on’t have to leave the house. 
Many adults seek in­ stant gratification. Like

 self-indulgent children, they sit in front of tin boob tube escaping tin here-and-now — like tin alcoholic or drug addict onlv THEIR addiction is 
TV! 
How many marriages are on the skids because either husband or wife must stay up to catch the late, late show, and then falls into bed too ex hausted to give a spouse the attention she (or he) needs? 
Siller 
How many familic spend the entire evening together in one room, yet ach is alone to himself 
In how many homes is the 
TV used as a baby sitter 
How many (am itie watch television during the dinner hour, when th* vents of the day should 
Ik* discussed? How many hildron retire to thei bedrooms to look at a T' that has been put there si there will lie no conflict between the program they want to watch and the fines their parent prefer? 
The most com­ mon excuse for so much 
TV is “ there isn t anyth­ ing else lo do.” What a sad commentary that life is so empty that the most constructive thing we can do is vegetate in front of a box! 
How much has TV helped to create a society of people who care for nothing except their own self-indulgence? How can the ordinary problems which beset the average family even begin to be solved if we aren’t willing to pry ourselves loose from the TV and give ourselv es a chance to s ta rt th inking of solutions? 

You do not need to be a psychiatrist to know that 
TV has played an impor­ tant role in the increase of violent crimes in our country. 
It s very difficult to use 
1 he TV wisely when the man of the house is fie biggest offender. How can you get your children away from the set when their father can find nothing better to do? ll seems as if I have no control over my own en­ vironment because TX comes before everything 
I implore those who sh a re my p roblem to offer a solution. — Mrs.

French touch of elegance 

A profusion of azaleas and native shrubs greet visitors to the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
James P. Robinson II, 3435 
Twisted Oakes. 

Ifs location on the hanks of Sala­ do Crock gives tho homo a fooling of quiet countryside — so quiet that door often amble across its green lawns to nibble a flower or two. 
The Robinson home will be fea­ tured on the 4oth Annual Home and 
Garden Pilgrimage sponsored hy 
Christ Episcopal Church, March 2o, 
27. 
French in design, the Robinson home is approached through a for­ mal courtyard. A two-story en­ trance hall is accented with crystal chandelier and enormous French pier mirror. The mirror is an heir­ loom from Mrs. Robinson's family, the Park Streets 
The formal dining room , at right angles to the the hall, is furnished with many fam ily antiques with touches of the Oriental. 
Floral 
The bright blue kitchen with cooking island and custom designed silver closets, is accented with flower garden walls 
A combination living room and trophy room contains massive dou­ ble fireplace and ceilings that ex­ tend to 2ft feet high— giving the feeling of light and spaciousness. 

Decorated in the tan and brown tones of fur-bearing animals, this room is filled with game trophies from family hunts at Eagle Pass. 
Speeimans of exotic game from the 
•Huntress Ranch are much in evi­ dence. A balcony from the second floor looks down into this room. 
Brick in the fireplace is from a church in Mexico. 

A cam ellia pink formal living room is also regarded as the music room. Ifs Louis XV motif is com*

Foot pow der 

Perspiration is a na tural and essential func­ tion in the human body. 
Its purposes are to eli­ minate wastes and to control body temperature by evaporation much as a mechanical refrigeration system does. 
But when this perspir­ ation is contained, as it often is in shoes, it ceases to retain its function and problems appear. 
The solution to these problems is to reduce the imount of perspiration to in acceptable level by an inti-perspirant. Here’s a ormula that has been 

 successful in doing that. 
Dry mix one tablespoon powdered alum with one-fourth cup boric acid, and one-third cup talc (These three items can be found at drug stores.) 
To use, sprinkle on feet, especially between toes, and in shoes. Store 

 i i i glass or plastic con­ tainer. 
Like any chemical pro­ duct you use at home, you should store this one safely, label it — listing ingredients and noting any cautions — and keep it out of reach of chil-

 w hich we slip into loneliness. A lifelong com panion or mate passe* away; a ch ild goes oft to school or into the m ilitary; a husband's profession puts ocean* between spouses. T h e n there is the one who cham pions a cause with a sense of right and a determ ined w ill to fight for it that too often causes him to stand alone. Abe Lin coln once said: 
I have been driven many times to m v knees bv 

 the overw helm ing conviction that I had nowhere to go.”

Even now. perhaps m ore than ever before, iii the course of m aking great 

 lecisions, the office of the president is the loneliest position iii the world. 

Cures For Loneliness 

• Friends are not m ade; they are sim ply recognized. T h is is probably the 

 very basis aud problem of lonely people. • In our search for deeply-rooled love, v c fail to recognize the friendliness of those about us. 

• W e must learn loo that every hum an ha* a weakness. Let us respect it a? a 

 m ark of charity, not a> a weakness to condem n. • Becom e a working and an in­ tegral part of your house of w orship. • Discover aud fill the needs of m anv who are so needful of friendship and help in lo u r com m unity. One who feels dim inished in the suffering of others never rem ains lonely. 

I say you never need to feel alone. N ever, never, never! Physically separated 

 from other people- perhaps. A lone? No need to he for He is with you alwavs.

Looking for lost brother 

DEAR ABBY: 
A recent article in the 
Birm ingham News credits you with helping to unite two sisters who hadn’t seen each other for 
23 years. 
The older girl came to the U .S.A . as a war bride. Six years later, both parents died and the younger sister, then 13, was placed with a Ger­ man family. That’s when her American sister lost track of her. 
Even the 
Germ an courts were unable to lo- cate the younger sister to 

 inform her that she had been left a small inheri­ tance. 
Three years ago, the 
American sister wrote to you asking for your help in locating her sister in 
Germany, and you su g­ gested that she write to the Salvation Army. She did. It took them three years, but they found her. (She had m arried, and her name had been changed.) 
Now I would like to lo­ cate a brother I haven't heard from in 12 years. I don’t even know if he’s alive. How do I go about getting the Salvation 
Army to help me? How much do they charge? 

Moving is deadly 

Everyone has a problem 
W h at’s yours? For a per sonal reply, write to ABBY

DEAR LOOKING: The 
Salvation Army’s M iss­ ing Persons Bureau has branches in every state in the nation and has lo­ cated m ore than 8,5oo lost or strayed persons in the last year. 

When no crim e has been committed, the po­ lice, Red Cross and wel­ fare agen cies refer callers to the Salvation 
Army. 

They have reunited adopted children with their “ real” parents, re­ turned to their families men who got tired of 
“ freedom” but were too embarrassed to go home. 
Brothers and sisters who had been separated in childhood have also been brought together. 

The Salvation Army has no special method. 
They check forwarding addresses and m ilitary records, telephone old friends and ex-em ­ ployers. 

Som e people do not want to be found because they have found a better life than the one they abandoned. In that case. the Salvation Army re­ ports that they have lo­ cated the missing person but cannot reveal hts whereabouts. 

W hether a search re­ q uires two days or IO years, the cost is the same — one dollar. And believe it or not, sonu folks don’t pay. 

 lf you want help in lo­ cating a lost relative, write to me and 1 11 for­ ward your letter to the 
Missing Persons Depart­ m ent of the Salvation 
Army. 

Three years ago, follow­ ing the death of my wife’s mother, we were faced with helping my wife’s 
85-year-old father decide w here he could best live. 

Ile was in fairly good health, but he was filled with doubts about remaining alone. He also wasn’t sure about moving north after 2o years in Florida. 
As it turned out. he came to live in a retirement home near us. 
And the adjustment in his style of living was no mean feat. After you've functioned independently all your life in your own home, it s quite a struggle to adapt to an institutional life. 
Though lie s had some rough m om ents, he’s survived and is still going strong. But in view of his experience, I was particularly interested in a report by Norman 
Bourestrom and Leon Pastalan of a project carried out by the In­ stitute of Gerontology at the Uni­ versity of Michigan. 
Study 

These researchers and their staff spent two years studying what happens to elderly patients in nursing homes when they are relocated to different settings. 
They started their project after becoming aware of the considera­ ble number of elderly who were forced to relocate. 
Often, the relocation is prompt­ ed by economic pressures or po­ licy changes.. Som etim es the move is forced by the closing of an inadequate nursing home. Rarely is the relocation made with con­ cern for the individual patient’s welfare. 
In all the cases studied by 

C 

B y----------------------------------- 
Dr. Walt Meiminger 

Bourestrom and Pastalan. the facilities to which the patients were transferred provided medi­ cal. nutritional and nursing care that was equal to or better than the care available in the previous facility. 
D espite that fact, the researchers found that the relo­ cation was likely to be a fatal move. The death rates for those persons whose situation was radi­ cally changed were double the death rate of a control group which did not change. 
H ealth 

Further, the study of the survivors in the radical change group showed other destructive effects. These patients grew in­ creasingly pessimistic about their health. 
They withdrew from activities in which they formerly engaged. 
They were less inclined to trust the staff looking after them, or to feel that others were interested in them. 
While the relocation had a ne­ gative effect on all age groups, it vs as most harmful for those of very advanced age. More than half of the patients over 78 years of age in the radical change group died, while only 28 per cent of their counterparts in the control group died. 
Survival 

One intriguing finding was that relocation tended to be more traumatic for women than men. 
Although the researchers could not be precisely sure w hy this was so, they speculated that women 

 become more involved and de­ pendent upon their im mediate environment. 
Elderly persons who were able to openly express feelings of re­ sentment and anger were more likely to survive. Those who re­ treated from conflict situations by denying their anger had a death rate twice that of persons who expressed anger openly. 

Since the effects of relocotion on the death rates tended to be con­ centrated just prior to and fol­ lowing the move, the researchers concluded that planning and pre­ paration of elderly persons for such a relocation should be care­ ful and thorough. 

It should begin as soon as pos­ sible before the move and con­ tinue at least three months after­ ward. 

I ii a pilot pre-move preparation program, deaths were reduced. 
The Gerontology Institute there­ fore developed a plan to help re­ locate nursing home patients which was utilized by the state of 
Pennsylvania. 

Their plan is one which can be helpful to anyone who has an el­ derly relative in prospect of moving. In a future column. I’ll rev iew some key elements of that plan.

 d e a fn e ss.” Take your ch oice. For som e, it seem s to be an accepta­ ble price tn pay for tin* enjoym ent of hyperam ­ plified music. It can be dangerous. 
Unfortunately, ears do not distinguish between b ru isin g sound w aves from a cannon on a battlefield and the roar­ ing din from souped-up loudspeakers. 
Any close range loud­ ness can injure ears. The ear drum need not be damaged. It is relatively sturdy com pared with the more delicate inner ear structures. 
But if the waves pene­ trate the bone and strike the hearing cells of the inner ear. they can cause real dam age. K inging sounds and hearing loss can occur. 
I f s hard to say whether things will im ­ prove. Loss can he per­ manent. and only perio­ dic testin g by audio­ gram s w ill show the degree of change after such an episode. 
Apparently some mu 
Simms are able to with­ stand it. perhaps through gradual buildup of toler­ ance over years. They would provide m aterial for an interesting study by ear experts.

Iii line with your ques lion. Mrs. D F. asks nu why she seem s to hear better in a noisy env iron mont despite her hearing loss 
The answer probably lies in the fact that per sons with normal hearing tend to raise their voices over loud sound, to which they are sen sitive and she isn t. It’s one advan­ tage a person with hear­ ing loss may have. 
Sn iidronu* 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: 
Both my thumbs are very painful I have been told the condition can be cor­ rected surgically. The diagnosis is “ radial tun­ nel syndrome.” Will you tell me something about this? 
Is surgery necessary? — G.A. 
N erves and tendons serving muscles, such as those in the hands, pass through narrow spaces called “ tu n n els.” The tunnels are named after the specific structures that pass through them in >our case the radial nerve. 
Any injury or pressure on this tunnel area, as from a tumor or accident or arthritic change in the joint area, may cause pain. With both thumbs involved one might su­ spect arthritis, because that is usuall> bilateral — meaning the same joints are involv ed on both sides of the body. 
Injection til steroid drugs helps in some si­ tuations. Others require 

 surgery to enlarge tilt* tunnel to rem ove pres­ sure on the nerve, lf un­ treated, such a nerve in­ jury tends to get worse, and eau lead to loss of use of the affected joint 
Because tuumus arc so im portant to the func­ tioning of the entire hand. it m ight be w ise to consider the surgery suggested. It is usually successful. 

Dr. Thostcson welcomes r e a d e r m all hut r e n r e ts that, due tv the tremendous 
\olum r received daily, he is unable to answer individual letters. Readers’ questions arr incorporated in his co­ lumn whenever possible.

A N N TRAVELSTEAD gives tips on tootsies 
Step up in style, comfort 

Tight blouses on tall blondes never go unnoticed in a crowd. 

But who stops to state at high arches stuffed into hand-rne- down espadrilles or scrawny toes running over sandal tops. 
Ann 
Travelstead does. The Baltim ore resident is education­ al director for the' 
Shoe Service Industry 
Council. 
By promoting proper foot and shoe care, she hopes to prevent Am ericans from abusing their feet. 
“ Tight blouses don’t h u rt.” says the traveling 
Mrs. 
Travelstead. “ Shoes do. They are the only clothing apparel that can permanently da­ mage your body.” 
The attractive edu­ cational director was here to tell San A n­ tonians how to invest in the foot market. 

Mrs. Travelstead s boots are a giveaway 
— she obviously is a wise shoe investor. The finely-crafted leather fashion boots look 1977 chic, but she says the boots were bought four years ago. 
There was not a crack nor a scuff in the soft, shining leather. 
Mileage 

The shoe educator gets extra m ileage from her shoes by taking them to the re­ pair shop at the first sign of wear. 
“ If a repair job costs one-third the price of new pair of shoes, I consider myself ahead of the gam e,” she says. 
M rs. Travelstead adm its she buys classic styles which remain in her ward­ robe for as long as six or seven years. 

The modern cobbler can update old styles iii a variety of wa.vs she says. Most com­ mon “ facelifts"' on old shoes can he made by adding a strap, cutting out toes and changing heel widths. 
Even the soles of leather tennis shoes can he retreaded, just like a tire! 
Polish 
Mrs. Travelstead has been shoe cons­ cious since childhood. 
Her lather insisted that Ills children wear well-made shoes that were polished to a military shine. 

“ He taught us to shine our patent leather 
M arnanes with left-over bis­ cuits,” she laughs. 
By the time she was 
12, she was earning pocket money by tak­ ing the neighbors’ shoes to the repair shop on Saturdays. 
Later, as an advertising account executive, Mrs Tra- velslead was the 

By 
Nancy Scott 
Jones 

 braintrust behind a series of award-win­ ning shoe advertise­ ments for a California department store. 
She encourages people to buy the best shoes they can afford on their budget. 

Her other advice is based on her own rou­ tines of footcare and shoe maintenance. 
Here are some of her tips for getting better m ileage from her shoes: 

Look for the “ hall­ m arks” of quality. 
Shoes should have no cement slop-over where the soles are joined. Hun hands in­ side the shoe to check for rough spots. Exa­ mine the heel seam to make sure it is straight. Check stitch­ ing. 
Testing 
M rs. Travelstead buys from a dependa­ ble dealer who knows her. She takes a new pair of shoes home for a “ test d rive.” She puts them on and wraps them in plastic bags, and walks a r­ ound the house to make sure they will he comfortable. 

Before wearing a new pair, she sprays them w ith silicone and applies a coat of polish or melted paste wax to protect against mois­ ture. 
“ Shoes need to breath,” Mrs. Travel- stead says. 
They should never be put on a closet floor or in closed boxes. She sug­ gests converting wine racks to shoe racks for storage. 
Heels should he re­ placed at the first sign of wear. 
Mrs. Travelstead also does daily exer­ cises to improve mus­ cle tone. 
“ Poor muscle tone wears out shoes fas- 
•ter." 
Each morning she does leg lifts, rotating each foot IO times clockwise and IO times counterclockwise, to strengthen muscles. 

“ Good muscle tone helps you to walk in a correct gate,” she says. 

M ais sages 

At the end of the day, she massages the base of the foot and the arch with a tennis* hall, a string of < wooden heads or an empty soda bottle 
Mrs. Travelstead also changes shoes after a long day on her feet. 
“ Most people treat their feet like they don't belong to their bodies,” she insists. 
“ If you're feet hurt, then you have someth­ ing wrong with them,”

Chairs are rocking good buys 

Q. 
“ We discovered an old golden oak rocking chair in the attic.'' —Sybil, Lebanon, Penn. 
A. Plain and fancy oak rockers were manufactured by numerous American furniture factories in the late 18oos, and early 19oos. 
Many makers were active in or ar­ ound (iratid Rapids. Mich. The shape 
•of the backs and arms varied, as did the seats of cane, wood, leather or upholstery. 
One small version was aptly named 
‘‘The Ladies Sewing Rocker.” while a larger roomier model was advertised as ‘‘The Farm er’s Friend.” Originally most styles sold for under $5. These old 
“ rocking good timers” rarely sell for under $1oo nowadays.

Q. 
‘‘I buy every crazy quilt possi­ ble.” —Mrs. S.L., Seattle. Wash. 
A. Time has been kind to the neg­ lected old crazy quilt, which is now respected as a treasured piece of 
American folk art. Strictly a salvage art, they were made from odd clothing and bits of material left over from sew ing projects. 
These colorful sentimental favorites graced couches and sofas as ‘‘parlor throws” or ‘ lap covers.” A finished quilt was often judged by the amount of embroidered decoration covering its surface. 
Locating two crazy quilts exactly

Some businesses make the choice 

Loop 41(1 is b e c o m in g San A ntonio s new Main 
Street as b u s in e s s s te a d ily a d v a n c e s northw ard towards the thoroughfare. 
This m ove away from the central city has caused businessm en in the central business district to face a 
.dilemma: 
Is it profitable to rem ain downtown, hoping for a rebirth of the central business district, or should the business relocate to where the action is now? 
The continuing m igration to the north has been brought into clearer focus by a recent study on the availability of office space — where is it is and where it isn't — by the Routh & Co. 
The study's conclusion is that choice office space in the N orth S id e , p a r tic u la r ly the north c e n tr a l business district, is reaching the saturation point. 
Right now, the occupancy rate of all the available lea sin g sp a ce for b u sin e sse s in the north central business district is running 87 per cent. 
This district runs in a w edge from IH35 north to the 
Loop, bounded by Vance Jackson Road on the west and by N acogdoches Road on the east. 

This d is tr ic t, the study p o in ts out, has only a 
1o-month supply of first class office space, based on till' le a sin g s of additional office space during the past year. 
The d em and for office space here would spill over into adjacent northeast and northwest districts for b u sin e sse s which could not find first-choice office space. 

M ean w h ile the total lea sab le office space dow n­ town is cu rren tly just over 2 m illio n square feet, which is 75 per cent occupied. 
The central business district has a three year sup­ ply of o ffic e s, based on the am ou n t of additional space leased last year. 
T he d o w n tow n v e r su s N orth S id e d ilem m a has grown m ore critical each year. D ecisio n s m ade by 
San A ntonio's m overs and sh ak ers on this question affect not only our downtown, but our economy and our c ity's growth. 
What lies behind some of these decisions? Here is what so m e of the city’s more im portant businessm en say.

Military unions are still debate issues 

By HOBART ROW FN 
WASHINGTON - How about the question of unionizing our 
Army, Navy and Marine Corps? 
I can almost hear the reaction of any drill sergeant at Parris Is­ land, but I ’m not sure this newspaper would choose to print it. 
President Carter and his Secretary of Labor, Ray Marshall, are opposed to unionization of the armed forces, and do not see it as a likelihood any time in the near future. 
But Marshall, asked about his views during his confirmation hearings, said that while he’s never advocated union­ ization of the armed forces, he believes the m ilitary services would benefit from a better grievance procedure outside the chain of command. 
Support for unionization comes from the American Federation of Govern­ ment Employees (A F G E ), which plans an organizing drive among military personnel. This, in turn, inspired a number of bills in Congress that bar military unions. 
The A FG E argues that since the new recruiting “ pitch” stresses civilian- type jobs and experience (rather than military or patriotic appeal), the uni­ formed men or women ought to have 

 iTheWeefc!

V I comparable basic rights, including,the right to join a union. 
The fact of the matter — although it’s almost unknown except to the. peo­ ple immediately involved — is that, in one key instance, collective act/on by 
U.S. military personnel already exists. 
Recognized unions 
Professor Ezra Krendel *uf the 
Wharton School at the University of 
Pennsylvania points out that the Air 
National Guard (ANG), “ is made up of units in which about 72 per aertt of the civilian-military technicians belong to recognized unions.’’ 
The ANG is about as im portant a group as one could find anywhere in the armed forces. 
, 
It makes up about three-ifourths of the Interceptor force that guards the 
United States against air attacks. 
The ANG personnel, ac/cording to 
Krendel, include part-time reservists and full-time civilian technicians. The technicians — including officers, air­ men, instructor pilots, vseather fore­ casters. and administration specialists 
— belong to at least eight, unions. 

Thus, the Management and Labor 
Division of the Arm y-Air National 
Guard engages, in effect, in collective bargaining (except on wages) with these civilian unions. According to the 
Wharton professor, this has been done 
“ with little publicity , and no apparent deterioration in military efficiency." 
Bul military leaders are exceedingly wary of extension of the system. Gen. 
George S. Brown, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Stafr, told the House 
Armed Services Committee not too long ago: 
“ I think unionization and the opera­ tion of the military forces are totally incompatible.” 

On his recent visit to the Pentagon, 
President Carter said it was his strong opinion that “ it would not be advisable to have the military personnel union­ ized." He added that he saw no support for the proposition, even among na­ tional union leaders. 
We’re a long way from accepting military unions as they exist in West 
Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Austria. The 
U.S. Supreme Court has noted that 
“ the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires a different application of 
(First Amendment) protections.

C lA iS lf llD DISPLAY 

NEW YORK, — U.S. business expects 1977 pretax profits to climb 14 per cent over 1976 to 
$155.5 billion, according to the 
McGraw-Hill Publications Com­ pany’s 12th annual Survey of 
Corporate Profit Trends. 
The dollar figure is a record high for the survey’s 12-year history. 
Other survey highlights reported by 
Douglas Greenwald, vice president and chief economist for the Publications 
Company, include: 
• Almost 81 per cent of firms expec t higher pretax profits this year than last. 
• . Approxim ately 56 per cent of companies are eyeing higher profit margins in 1977. 
• Increased cash flow is expected by every major industry this year, with the average rise 13 per cent. C ash flow consists of retained earnings and depreciation. 

• While 74 per cerat of planned 1977 capital expenditures.are expected to be financed internally through this cash flow the same percentage as in 1976. funds needed froin external sources will be up significantly this year. 
Better Than Normal 

The combined nesults of the survey, 
Mr. Greenwald said, “ suggest a better than normal corporate financial situa­ tion in 1977. 
“ Corporations,'’ he said, “ expect to have the resources to generate a rising level of capital, spending during the year. This, in turn, may be expected to provide a spur to the rest of the econ­ omy.’’ 
But, while most signs are favorable, he cautioned, 11)77 could see a greater strain on the credit markets because the amount of capital funds needed from external sources will rise $4.25 billion. 
Survey resists also support the con­ clusion that the economy is again

Steel and fabricated metals will be well above average with 25 and 2o per vent increases, respectively.

“ Good management’ ’ 

In an interview, Marshall said he thinks the important question to be settled relates to “ good management’’ 
_ something that both the armed ser­ vices and civilian pursuits can't bene­ fit from unless there are good grie­ vance procedures. 
“ If the troops have a problem with their sergeant," says Marshall, it s pretty hard to go through the chain of command to correct that. 
The Army could establish a mechanism for grie­ vances through the existing Uniform 
Code of M ilitary Justice, M arshall said, or provide some special way for handling complaints without causing reprisals. 
Professor Krendel thinks that such a trend — taking effect very slowly — is 
• probably inevitable. Without the expli­ cit development of m ilitary unions, such an evolutionary change is bound to be hastened by the all-voluntary character of the armed forces.

Frost recalled when they were dis­ cussing the new office building, there were plans to build one about 25 per cent larger than the present building. 
Since bank regulations restrict how much a bank can invest in quarters, an insurance company expressed interest

He said he was disappointed at the downtown “ move-outs, ’ and wished they had given the move more consi­ deration. 
“ It s real easy to quit. People move north and I never see them again, and I 
‘lament this fact," he said. 
However, he said he was not com­ plaining about northside development, and stressed the common interest.

“ I ’ve still got some land out here I bought in 1973 for about 6o cents per sq. ft., and right now, it's only about $2,” he said. 
First class office space leases from 
$6 to $7.5o per sq. ft. on an annual basis both downtown and on the northside. 
“ Now with the same rental return, why would I want to go downtown when 
I get a much better return on Loop 41o investments?’’ he questioned. 
He also complained about trustee- control of downtown property. 
“ Trustees are the hardest people in the world to deal with.’’ 
Dement said much of the land downtown trustees are trying to sell for 
$53 a sq. ft. is on the tax rolls for as little as $2o per sq. ft. 
“ Let’s put it on the tax rolls at what they claim ifs worth,” he snapped.

Tim es are right for the wildcat drillers 

By STEVEN RATTNER 
NEW y o r k t im e s s e r v ic e 

HOUSTON — “ It’s a busy tim e,’’ said George A. G eom , who, with his two brothers, ex­ plores for oil around the Gulf 
Coast. “ The opportunities are super, the demand is so high and the price is right.” 
Alcorn is involved in the new stam ­ pede to find oil and gas. In 1975, his p a rtn e rs h ip , w hich e m p lo y s only a half-doztjfi people, d rille d six w ells across the Gulf Coast. 

Last yeaT, ll were completed, and this year the total should re a c h 25. 
Alcorn’s goal. he says, is to drill 7o wells each year. 
P r o f i t s ‘a re not so m e th in g Alcorn likes to talk about, but the firm clearly does well. In contrast to the im age of the trad itio n al w ild c a tte r, he w ears 
Italian loafers instead of cowboy boots and notes appointm ents in Gucci date- book. He and his two brothers, opera­ tors of the Alcorn D evelopm ent Co., have offices in a prestigious building here. 
Nor are the Alcorns alone. Propelled by risin g p ric e s and p e rio d ic s h o r ­ tages. the petroleum industry — from the Exxon Corp. to the sm allest inde­ p e n d e n t — is s e a r c h i n g for new supplies. 
"It is m ore profitable to find oil now than it w as in 1973.” said C h a rle s 
Blackburn, executive vice president of the Shell Oil Co. “ That has autom ati­ cally accelerated activity." 
Shell’s exploration has risen from 
596 wells drilled in 1973 to 797 wells last y e a r. In d u s try w id e , in 1976, 41,2o9 holes were punched — as oilmen term the process — co m p ared with 39,o97 the year before. 

P e a k in g n u m b e r s 

After rising sharply in the postwar years, the n um ber of wells drilled in the U nited States peaked in 1965 at 
58,16o and began a steady decline. Not coincidentally, the oilmen contend, the price of oil began to decline about the sam e time. 
F inally, in 1971, the decline halted at 
27,3oo w ells, m o re than 5o per cent drop from the peak 15 y ears earlier. 
T he tu rn a ro u n d came* alm o st at the sam e tim e as the first w arnings of an 

About two years are needed to begin production from a well, say oil execu­ tives here, so they feel the impact o f increased drilling is just beginning to be felt 

 approaching shortage of oil and gas. . 
T h a t w o rld -w id e s h o r ta g e and 
A m erican’s loss of self-sufficiency led to the successful price increases by the 
Organization of Petroleum P-xporting 
Countries, experts contend 
The oilmen call this situation clear proof that decontrol of oil and gas is overdue. 
“ The Am erican investing public has seen a prices rises substantially and is optimistic that they won t fall back.” said R o b e rt VV. B y b e e , o p e r a tio n s m a n a g e r in the ex p lo ratio n d e p a r t­ ment of Exxon U.S.A., the domestic* arm of Exxon Corp, here. 
“ This is one of the most compelling reasons for the decontrol of oil and gas prices.” 
C ritic s of th e in d u s try d is a g re e . 
Martin Lobel, a W ashington law yer, arg u es for exam ples, that increased drilling does not mean increased pro­ duction. The av era g e U nited .States well produces less than 2o barrels of oil per day, w hile at a M ideast g u sh er could y ield a th o u s a n d tim e s th a t amount. 
Instead. Lobel says, price controls should be maintained and renew ed e m p h a s is placed on offshore a re a s, which he contends would not require the h ig h e r p r ic e s to be d e v e lo p e d economically, 

T im e la g 

B e c a u se ab o u t two y e a r s a r e r e ­ qu ired to begin pro duction from an on shore well and far m ore needed for offshore developm ent, oil executives bere believe the im pact of the incr­ eased drilling is just beginning to be felt. 
Last year. Shell’s oil production fell by about 3.5 per cent, continuing the trend, but natural gas production in­ creased slightly to 683 billion cubic feet from 679 billion. Recently, the Mobil 
Oil Corp. said that its natural gas pro­ duction would in c rease slightly this year and other com panies are giving sim ilar projections. 

N atio nally, Exxon’s latest e n erg y outlook p ro jec ted th a t d o m estic oil production would begin to increase late this year with the addition of the Alas­ kan production but suggested that the d e c lin e in n a tu r a l g a s p ro d u c tio n 
\$ould not halt until the early 198os. 

"A lot of fairly m atu re oil and gas provinces are in substantial declines." said Isaac C. Her ridge J r., vice presi­ dent of the Hughes Tool Co., a leading su p p lie r of d rillin g e q u ip m e n t. " I t takes a lot of drilling to offset those declines " 

But the executives continue to insist that the offshore frontiers* less than 5 per cent of which have been developed,, rem ain the best opportunity,

The managers of the nation’s 5o or so closed-end in vest­ ment com panies seem to be caught in a paradox that has been sharpened by a shift in in vestors’ judgments. 
Most of the closed-end com panies, so called be­ c a u s e th e n u m b e r of s h a r e s th e y hav e o u t ­ sta n d in g is fixed, have tr a d itio n a lly tr a d e d at discounts from net asset value — below the m a r ­ ket value of the secur­ ities iii which they invest. 
The Lehman Corp,, tor exam ple, currently tr a d ­ ing at around IU a share, has a net asset value of

By RUTH WALKER 
Do your feet hurt? 
Like millions of others, you probably find it painful to walk any substantial distance or to stand for any length of tim e. You usually can’t wait to set home so you can take off your shoes. 
But your feet are not supposed to hurt any more than your elbow or head is supposed to ache, lf your feet bother you. something is wrong. 
The reason most of us accept aching feet as normal is that so many of us have them. In fact, scores of surveys have shown that seven out of IO adults suffer from foot problems. Why? 
The feet are masterpieces of engin­ eering. Of the human body’s 2o8 bones, 
52 are in the feet. The feet also contain 
HH joints, 2o4 ligaments, 4o m uscles and m illio n s of m uscle fib ers and blood vessels arranged in such a way as to not only support but to balance the weight of the entire body. Like any com plicated piece of m achinery, the two appliances at the end of our ankles are v u lnerable to m echanical prob­ lems. 
When we stand, for instance, the feet carry the dead weight of our bodies. In w alking, we jolt them with a force am ounting to several tons a day. A 
1511-pound man who walks a mile at three feet a step brings down on his feet a workload of 122 tons — 264,ooo pounds — in that distance. The aver­ age adult walks five miles per day. takes 2,4oo steps per mile, 8o,ooo steps a week or 4 million steps a year — that's equal to three times around the world. 
Our feet not only act as shock ab­ sorbers and supports as we walk, bu* as levers and catapults as well. 
Bul Mother Nature made a mistake and included an inborn fault in the stru ctu re of our feet. She fitted the bones together in such a way that the 
• principal weight-bearing area of the foot is off-center. Our full poundage co m es down through the ankle and strik es as the ankle joint and other closely related rear-foot bones tilt. 
This is called pronation, and it is the condition which is at the root of most aching feel. 
H ow ever, if we used our feet as 
M other N ature had intended — un­ ham pered by shoes on soft surfaces such as grass or sand — they would serve us well without pain or discom­ fort; providing, of course, there is not an inborn pathologic problem. Instead, we pound our feet daily on concrete surfaces, force them into poorly de­ signed prisons called shoes and ignore signals heralding crippling injury. 
By th e tim e the a v e ra g e child 

 reaches grade school, chances are one out of two that he or she has some foot ailment. 
The mothers of these children have an even greater chance of multiple foot problems. Once upon a time, women stayed home. They could get off their feet and rest during the day, and they could w ear slippers or go barefoot around the house. But now , women are in the labor force, standing or walking all day long in factories, stores, res­ taurants, hospitals and offices. 
Women are particularly prone to foot problem s, first of all. because they bear the children. When pregnant, a woman’s center of gravity shifts and her weight increases, putting a great strain on the delicate structures within her feet. 
Second, women are suspecting to fashion, no m atter how ridiculous and potentially dangerous the shoe style. 

Men, too. have their foot problems. 
A large percentage of rejections for the armed services were because of foot ailments, and surv eys have shown that one man in Kl is absent from work se­ veral days each month for the same reason. In fact, the auto industry has reported that foot problems are pre­ sent in half tin* men employed.

Footwords, foolisluiess, fool lore. 

Industrial experts maintain that sore feet are a frequent cause of accidents, not only to the lower extremities but to other parts of the body. Industry pays 
$5oo million a year for such work-re­ lated injuries. 
Most people think of corns, bunions, ingrown toenails and perhaps athlete's foot when you mention foot problems. 
But there are some 75 ailments affect­ ing the feet and at least 22 diseases producing foot symptoms. 
There are the congenital malforma­ tions such as clubfoot or flatfoot. There are circulatory problems such as 

 blood clots and narrowing of the leg areries. 
The nutritional deficiency disease, rickets, can misshape the foot bones and the complications of diabetes can cause loss of the foot if not treated properly. Gout usually makes its pain­ ful appearance in the big toe, and kid­ ney and heart disease may be diag­ nosed through swollen feet. 

Even your toenails can tell tales about your health. A striated one com­ bined with dry skin may signal a hor­ mone problem such as thyroid dys­ function. Numbness may be a sign of diabetes, anemia, low blood pressure or just fatigue. 

O verw eight? You m ay suffer the first consequences of too much food through symptoms in your feet which produce premature degenerative arth­ ritis due to the added wear and tear on the bones and joints and ingrown toenails because of excess flesh about the nails. 

Strains, sprains and fractures are common whether you are overweight or not but so are emotional symptoms. 
Those problems in your head can cause nervous tremors in your feet, excess sweating, skin disturbances such as rashes, itching and even p aralysis without a physical cause. 

On the other hand, painful feet can cau se emotional problems, lf your feet hurt, you may feel justifiably cranky. 
It you can't get around because of a foot disability, you may feel depressed. 

Most of the problems with our feet have been caused by neglect. Physical examinations usually stop at the knee. 
Fool ailments are either ignored or neglected. Shoes are improperly de­ signed and fitted, and do-it-yourself rem edies often com pound the prob­ lems.

Angels: God’s secret agents 

By BILLY GRAHAM 

My wife, who was born and raised in China, recalls that in her childhood days tigers lived in the mountains. One day a poor woman went up to the foothills to cut grass. To her back was tied a baby, and a little child walked beside her. In her hand she carried a sickle to cut grass. 
Just as she reached the top of a hill she heard a roar. Frightened almost speechless, she looked around to see a mother tigress springing at her, fol­ lowed by two cu b s. T h is illitera te 
Chinese mother had never attended school or entered a church. She had never seen a Bible. 
But a year or two earlier a mission­ ary had told her about Jesus, “who is able to help you when you are in trou­ ble." As the claws of the tigress tore her arm and shoulder, the woman cried out in a frenzy. "Oh Jesus, help m e!’’. This ferocious beats, instead of attacking again to get an easy meal, suddenly turned and ran away. 
The Bible says, “ He w ill give his angels charge of you, to guard you all vour ways" (Psalm BLH BSV). Had 
(iud sent an angel to help this poor ignorant Chinese woman? Are there supernatural beings today who are able to influence the affairs of men and nations? 
The Reverend John G. Paton, a m issionary in the New Hebrides Is­ lands, tells a thrilling story involving the protective care of angels. Hostile natives surrounded his mission head­ quarters one night, intent on burning the Batons out and killing them. 

A year later, the chief of the tribe was converted to Jesus Christ, and Mr. 
Baton, rem em bering what had hap­ pened, asked the chief what had kept him and his men from burning down the house arid killing them The chief replied in sui pi lac, ‘ Who were ail 
I 

Beginning a great new series 

 those men you had with you there?” 
The m issionary answered, "There were no men there; just my wife and 

The chief argued that they had seen many men standing guard — hundreds of big men in slanging garments with drawn swords in their hands. They seemed to circle the mission station so that the natives were afraid to attack. 
Only then did Mr. Baton realize that 
God had sent his angels to protect them. 
During World War ll. Captain Eddie 
Rickenbaeker was shot down over the 
Bacific Ocean. For weeks nothing was heard of him. The newspapers report­ ed his disappearance and across the country thousands of people prayed. 
Mayor LaGuardia asked the whole city of New York to pray for Rickenbaeker. 
Then he returned. The Sunday papers headlined the news, and in an article. Captain Rickenbaeker himself told what had happened. "And this part I would hesitate to tell,” he wrote, 
“except that there were six witnesses who saw it with rue. 

“A gull cam e out of nowhere, and lighted on my head — I reached up my hand very gently — I killed him and then we divided him equally among us. 
We ate every bit, even the little bones. 
Nothing ever tasted so good." This gull saved the lives of Rickenbaeker and his companions. 
Years later I asked him to tell me the story p erso n a lly , because it was through this experience that he came to know Christ. He said, “ I have no bee ANGELS, Rage 2H

R o n a ld A d le y was tra p p ed with nine other miners March I after water broke through a tunnel wall in the 
K ocher Coal Co. mine in Tower 
City9 Pa. 
He was buried alive f o r 122 hours. 
This is his story. 

By RONALD ADLEY 

AS TOED TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
I try to blunket all out. But someth­ ing like that you never wipe completely from your mind. 
Over and over again, I feel it hap­ pening ... choking for air, gasping for breath under cold, dirty, smelly mine water ... trapped with two dead bud­ dies in a black coal mine. 
I keep hearing that terrible sound of water, rising sw iftly. 
It cam e rolling stra ig h t at m e, crushing mine timbers, smashing into walls of coal, closing every possible escape hole with debris. 
What happened Tuesday morning, 
March I, a mile underground at Big 
Lick Mountain, still gives me night­ man's. Even when I’m awake. 
I can’t really rem em ber too much about that winter day before the water crashed in. Or even who I talked to. I guess it was the shock of seeing that unexpected force of nature. 
What bothers me though is why, or how, I alone was spared, while nine other men died deep in the earth. Later 
I would wonder if I had been spared only to die alone days after my friends. 
Anna Mac (my wife) woke me at 4 a.m. like she always does when I’m on the day shift. I had coffee, a couple of eggs and then went outside to wait for my ride to the Kocher Coal Co. mine. 
There I changed into work clothes, hooked on a freshly charged battery to my head lamp, and went into the tun­ nel. I was assigned to work with Ralph 
Renninger and Donald Shoffler. 
Down in the mine, we drilled test holes to check where there might be w ater above us. This is alw ays done for safety purposes. 
Most of the m orning we kept drilling. 
Then we hit rock. We stopped drilling to fire some dynamite near the ceiling of that deep coal chute. We wanted to clear away loose rock and coal so it couldn’t fall down on us. 
While the blast smoke was clearing. 
I ate the lunch that my wife had packed 
— pressed ham sandwiches, three of them, I think. There was also a pork chop left from dinner the night before, some cake and a fruit dessert. I had a 
Thermos of coffee. I really enjoyed it. 
Then we climbed back up the ladder to the top. I was on top, Renninger a notch below, and Shoffler just below him. 
Looking down, in the yellow glow of our lamps, I could see ham mers and picks and shovels piled on the dusty floor about HO feet below. 
Above, the sm oke from the blast hadn’t quite cleared. We decided to give it a couple of more seconds when 
— suddenly — it happened. 
We felt this terrific gush of air. 
Whooooosh! 
It was chilling. Like the feel of death. 
It came from somewhere down below us. It went everywhere. I thought it was top rock that broke some place that made this air. 
And then I saw the water. That was something I had never seen in my life. 
It looked like a great big dam that burst. Like a gusher of water forcing its way out of the ground. Force like I had never seen. 
We watched it for a couple of split seconds, not knowing what to do — or what it would do. 
Then it started to come up towards us. bringing up timber, and boards, and all that kind of stuff, (.'oui, too. 
The water roared up, and caught me in it, hitting with terrific force. It came so fast. So fast. 
I didn't know what happened to 
Ralph and Don. 

We didn t hear any warning when 
Du1 water cam e. I heard no alarm bells. I heard no sounds, I heard no 

 shouting from other men. Nothing. 
Even when the air had come first I heard nothing. 
The water went all the way up to the roof of that shaft, more than lit) feet. It covered everything. 
I was in it. I was just floating behind the tim b er, fighting the p re ssu re , holding my breath as long as I possibly could, searching for an air pocket ... 
Along the top. In a crevice of the coal. 
Someplace. Anyplace. 
I saw some bubbles, and grabbed some air, and then was yanked deeper into the swirling water w ith the junk banging into me. I was swinging my arm s like a windmill, and kicking, fighting the d rag from the heavy clothes and tools on me. I was holding my breath. And holding it. And holding it." fI was trapped. 
I should have been in a panic, but for some reason 
I had no fear/ 

I thought the end was there for me, that it was all over. But then 
I heard in my mind my little boy and my little girl saying to me, 
‘Daddy, hold your breath, hold it as long as you can, like you used to show us in our sw im m ing pool.’ 
And I did. For the longest time. I don't know how long. 
Then I felt the water going down, and I found a little space at the top, and I could breathe. 
I felt so good inside. I was so thank­ ful to Clod. 
As the water dropped. I found I was stuck where I had grabbed at some timber, at the top of the shaft. My light cord was caught in the coal. 
I took my battery off my belt, and I was looking around in tile blackness and I saw another light shining below. 
It was off Renninger who was lying on the coal. He was dead. 
So I took his light and I used that to look around to see what was going on, and where I was at.- 
I didn’t see Shuffler but I saw his light shining through the rocks aud timber down past Renninger. I actual­ ly didn't know he was there. I just felt he w as there. 
The whole thing happened before noon and lasted about five minutes. 
That’s all! 
There was coal falling all around me and I wasn’t getting touched. 
That was the part I d id n ’t u n d er­ stand It was like standing in the m id­ dle of a whole pile of coal com ing down. like I was in some kind of tube, and the coal couldn't hit me. T h at’s what it felt like. 
I sal down to get my breath for a minute or two. I didn’t know if there was going to be more water coming out. Or what was going to happen. 
That s when I was praying to Hod so bad to help me. 

After the flood hit, the first thing I did was listen for som e noise, any noise. But there was only silence. I was trapped in a coal mine. 
I should have been in a panic, I guess. But for some reason I had no fear. I don’t know how to explain that. 
Feet through the ages 

By RON WHITE 
The English language might well have been at a standstill without feet. 
Throughout the ages, the lowly foot has given rise to some of our most common and colorful expressions. 
And yet while everyone uses foot ex- prussians daily,jn a n y persons do not know the derivation '* of these pedestrian phrases. 
Here are the origins of some of the 
English language’s more common foot usages. 

FUSSY FOHT: A term that origin­ ated among federal revenue agents in the southern U. S. 
The agents, to avoid detection when surrounding un illegal still, would tie anesthetized house cats to the soles of their shoes. 
The technique allows the agents to move silently, and has since come to mean any sort of sneaking around. 

FEET OF CLAY: A term that ori­ ginated in the Bibbs in England when unpaved streets created a muddy clay to cling to shoes during the rainy sea­ son. 
To have “ feet of clay” was a sign that one could not afford a carriage, and one of the most devastating insults one could make was to shout, “ Feet of clay!" while simultaneously pretend­ ing to wipe his feet. 
A person thus insulted was bound to lash himself IO tunes with stiff rope and was not allow ed to attend the queen’s ball.

R O N A L D ADLEY can sm ile now th at h e ’s sa fe in a hospital, but he h asn’t fo rgo tte n his terror 

I guess God didn’t put fear in my head. But He had given me strength I never knew I had. 
The silence was broken by the thump of coal lumps falling. Otherwise it was quiet. 
Then I felt some air coming in and I started out to find where it was coming from. 
Holding my miner’s light in my hand 
— I lost my hardhat in the water — I went searching for the air, for a way out. for anyone who might have been trapped with me. 
I couldn't find anyone. And I couldn’t find any way out. 
I started to crawl down into the mine shaft. N early Kb feet down it was blocked by broken tim bers and rock and coal. 
I decided to head back up the shaft because it was the only place the res­ cue crews would know where I could be. 
I crawled past the body of Ren­ ninger. and found a safe place to sit. 
My light was still pretty bright. I looked around trying to think of what to do and that’s when I started praying to God. 
I ve prayed to God before but not like 
I did that day. I asked God also, Why me being left alive?’ 
I was getting pretty cold. I was soaking wet. I took off my boots and dumped the w ater out. After that I tried to get warm by shifting around a little bit but that didn’t do much good. 
I started doing push-ups and different leg and arm stretches, stuff I used to do when I was in my high school gym classes. 
'It was dead silence. It was like a tomb down there.' 

I didn’t have any food but I did fina a jug of w ater that had com e up from the flooding. It didn’t have much in it. 
I rationed that because.I had idea bow long I was oging to be in there. I only took a little sip at a time, to make my lips wet, and just a little to swal­ low I told myseflf that as long as I had w ater I could live utnil som eone reached me. 
I didn t look at my watch, but two hours m ust have passed since the water gushed in. I thought of my kids and my wife — what they must be go­ ing through and how they were taking it. It was really bothering me. 
As I was thinking of my family I 
.started getting groggy and tired. I fell

 asleep for a while but woke up cold and shaking. 
I began listening again. I wanted to see if i could hear any noise at all. Any kind of tapping. 
But it was dead silence. It was like a tomb down there. 
‘Ron,’ I said to myself, ‘you got to get a piece of metal, something real hard, and start tapping yourself.’ 
I found a six-foot piece of steel and I started tapping. I did it every five minutes at the start. Then sometimes every three minutes. Then every IO minutes. But no one answered. I was alone. 
I wasn’t scared. I didn’t cry. I just prayed. 
I started to doze off again but woke up cold. I think it was about 9 o’clock at night. 
I started to tap, but still no answer. 
So I tried to get some sleep. 
This time when I woke up I think it was morning. I started tapping again. 
What else could I do? 
My light was completely dead. I was in the dark. I kept doing pushups to warm up, and to keep my senses, and to stop shaking. 
I knew th e bodies of R alph and 
Shoffler were not far from me. I knew if I would think about them I would start imagining crazy things. 
I blanked everything out of my mind. 
I didn't have any fantasies. I didn’t see anything funny in the darkness. I had my head in pretty good shape. I didn’t hallucinate. 
I kept thinking about my wife and children, my father and mother, my brothers and sisters. I kept seeing myself laying on my lounge couch in my living room with my two kids in my arms watching television. 
My only hope was to get back to my family. 
I kept saying over and over, ‘Please 
God, help me.’ I didn’t know what was in store for me. I knew I couldn’t help myself. I felt like quitting. I felt like laying back and letting nature take its course. 
And I said, ‘Oh. God, did you let me live just to die like this here? Or wha!?’ 
I m ust have been dozing when I thought I heard some noise. But I w asn’t sure. I listened a g a in , and heard nothing. 
I grabbed the steel. And I started tapping. Hard. 
Very hard. 
I listened a second, and I Ijcard some tapping back. 
Tap. Tap. Tap. The m iner’s signal. 
You can’t imagine how I felt. 
I couldn’t see a thing. Not even my hand in front of me. It was pitch black. 
But I felt that I could see life again. 
We started tapping back and forth. I couldn’t hear any other sounds but the tapping, and I made sure it wasn’t an echo. 

We tapped different signals. I sent out 5 taps — dat, dat, datdat-dat. And they’d send back a message a couple of taps shorter, or a lot longer. 
I thanked God that somebody had finally heard me, and was coming to get me. 
I wasn’t tired, and I wasn’t scared. 
Well, maybe I was tired. I think I dozed off, and didn’t hear nothing for a while. 
Then — suddenly — a drill was cut­ ting towards me. 
It was like m u sic to my ea rs, through a 5o-foot wall of coal ... a wall so hard it took nearly five days to break through to me. 
Really, it was freedom what I felt. I was finally going to get out of this place. I just couldn’t wait. It was a wonderful feeling inside of me. I knew then I would see my family again. 

‘It’s Ronnie Adley! It’s Ronnie Ad­ ley ! ’ 
I must have yelled it about six times before I heard the voice of my for­ eman, Palmer Mervine. 
Ronnie, are you all right?’ 
‘Get me out of here!’ • 
‘B’s good to hear your voice, Ron­ nie.” 
Palmer’s voice was the first human being I heard since the water gushed through the mine and left me trapped in darkness. It seemed like a lifetime but it was only a little more than a day. 
It took about three hours after I heard the tapping to cut the first tiny hole through the 5o feet of coal above me. 
I barely saw' a pinpoint of light and it was even h a rd e r to hear anything clear. 
I shorted back to Palmer to tell my wife I was okay. 
I knew it was going to take some time. They told me to relax, to sit still, and they’d get food and water. 
Right off I told them about my bud­ dies who were dead below me. They asked me if I heard anybody else, any other tapping. 
‘No. Nothing.' 
And I had no idea where the five other missing men might be. 
They punched a second hole pretty quick, angling down from the other side of the pillar of coal that separated us. A couple of plastic tubes were pushed through and some orange juice was poured through. It tasted great. 
Then they s ta rte d d rillin g and drilling and drilling. Trying to get a hole big enough to pass me some food. 
It was the longest time. I went into the mine Tuesday morning. It was now 
Thursday morning and the hole was finished. 
Now I could talk better to them. 

'I was worried about another collapse as they drilled towards me.’ 

First they passed through a rope, and hooked on a m iners lamp connected to batteries on the other end. It felt good to see things again. The rope becam e a conveyer, carrying plastic bags of water, of coffee, of soup. 
After I ate I felt even better. 
I asked for a chewing tobacco, and got it. It tasted really good, made my mouth moist. 
I asked for a shot of whisky. 
‘We can’t give you that in the mine, 
Ronnie.’ 
‘I know that, I’m just kidding.’ 
They sent me blankets. And I got long underwear, a dry shirt and pants, a cap, and gloves. I changed nty clothes. 

They started drilling lots of holes. 
The plan was to drill enough holes and then break open a tunnel, about 2o inches wide. It would be wide enough for me to squeeze through. I couldn’t wait. 
Each shift that came on always sent in food and we would joke around. 
Don’t you have any candy b ars around?’ 

‘How about a good looking woman to keep you warm?’ or ‘How about a little lobster?’ 
I’d ask them what time it was, and what day it was, because my watch had stopped. And every day that passed the waiting got tougher. 

It seems that the closer they got the further away they felt. 
I d holler: ‘Hey, how far a re you now9’ 
And they’d say, ‘Ron, we are work­ ing as hard as we possibly can.’ 
‘I know that.’ 
‘The coal is very hard,’ 
‘I know that, too.’ 
I wouldn’t talk to them very much because they told me: ‘We can stand and blab all night and ifs not going to get you out.’ 
But it felt good that I could talk to somebody. 
I knew it was going to take a while, them cutting just inches every hour. 
They couldn’t fire any dynamite at all. 
They couldn’t chance shaking an y th ­ ing. They didn’t want to loose anything that might fall on me or them. 
I was worried about another collapse as they drilled toward me. 
As they came doser the noise of the drills and the air hammers got louder and louder. They’d name a day and a time they’d reach me, but the hardness of the coal, it was like iron, set them back again and again. 
So I just lay back on the b la n k et thinking of my wife and my kids, to keep my mind away from the mine. It was an experience I hope no one ever had to go through. 
Then on Saturday night, they finally punched through the escape tunnel but it had to be widened. 
‘Give yourself a break and let m e use that ham mer for a while,’ I told the guy with the air drill. 
So they passed it in and I was cutting that coal. 
Boy, it felt good to cut my ow n way out. I cut for the longest time and then they said they were going to try to pull m e out. 
I tried but my shoulders c o u ld n ’t make it. There wasn’t enough room. 
The hole was head high and I had to pull myself up and into it. 
So I got down again and they started drilling again and I started ripping all the stuff loose at my end, pulling at the coal with my bare hands. 
That’s how great I felt. 
It took about another 8 to IO hours to widen the hole. And wiien I squeezed through to the other side, to freedom, it felt so great — just like being born again. 
I shook hands with ev ery b o d y . I thanked them all. They told me to sit down, take a break. I sat getting my breath and calming myself down a lit- 
‘tle bit. 
I was in good shape. I wasn’t hurt. 
‘Do you want to be carried out on a stretcher?’ 
‘Hell no, I want to walk out of here.’ 
And I did. right to the mine cars that had carried me into the mine six days earlier. Riding out took just four m in­ utes. I got out and went into the a m ­ bulance. 
The ambulance people asked me if I wanted to lay down, and I said, ‘No.’ 
We pulled alongside the highway, not far from the mine, and my w ife got out of a police car and got into the a m ­ bulance. 
I hugged her. I kissed her. I was making her all dirty. But she didn't care how black she was getting. She just felt good inside. 
I didn’t want to go to the hospital. 
But I had to make sure there was no water in my lungs. 
Now I’m home. My 8-year old son asks me how it was down there. I try to explain it to him but he's too young to understand. 
I told him, and my little girl (she’s ll), they really helped me in there, when I was in the water: ‘You are the ones who helped me get here, where I am now, with you.’ 
Will I go back into th e m in e ? I couldn't tell you. Right now, I’m a lit­ tle afraid of it. I don’t know if I can ever go back into the mines again. 
At this point now I know I couldn’t do it because there’s too much fear of it. 
That fear came to me as I lay in my hospital bed, thinking back. 
Everybody must gamble through life no nuttier what kind of work they do. 
T h e y ’re taking a chance. But the thought that keeps coming back to my mind is getting trapped underground. 
That’s the part I don’t know if I could handle again

His angels." 

During my ministry I have heard or read literally thousands of sim ilar stories. Could it Ik* that these were all hallucinations or accidents or fate or luck? Or were real angels sent from 
God to perform certain tasks? 

.lust a few y ears ago such ideas would have been scorned by most edu­ cated people. The idea of supernatur­ al lyings was thought to be nonsense, the ravings of the lunatic fringe. 
All this has been changed. Think, for example, of the m orbid fascination modern society has for the occult. 
Walk into a book store in London; visit any newsstand at a modern air­ port; go to a university library. You will be confronted by shelves and ta­ bles packed with books about the devil, 
Satan worship and demon pssession. 
A num ber of Hollywood films, tele­ vision programs and as many as one in four hard-rock pop songs are devoted to, or thematically make reference to, the devil. 

The Exorcist has already proved to be one of the biggest m oney-m akers of any film iii history. 
Some polls indicate Blat 71) per cent of Americans believe in a personal de­ 

 vil. Walter Cronkite announced a poll over CBS network news showing that the num ber of Am ericans who now believe in a personal devil has in­ creased 12 per cent. 
It is ironic that a generation ago, scientists, psychologists, sociologists and even some theologians were pre­ dicting that by the late 197os there would be a sharp decline in the belief in the supernatural. The reverse is true. 
Even in the Christian world the pro­ cess has turned out a rash of books on the devil by both Catholic and Protes­ tant writers. I personally believe we have more than given the devil his due with too many books about him. I tend to think the devil is getting too much 

 attention. 
The Bible does teach that Satan is a real being who is at work in the world together with his emissaries, the de­ mons. 
The em inent British surgeon/psy- ehiatnst, Dr. Kenneth McAll, is an authority on the subject of sutanology. 
He spent many years in China, but was forced to return to England, where he took up psychiatry. When he became convinced that hundreds of bis patients would not be helped by his surgeon's scalpel or his psychiatrist’s couch, he rem em bered the dem onism he had observed firsth an d in China in tile 
193os.

Dr. Mc All is convinced that ostei bly innocent pastimes such as forti telling, Ouija boards, ta ro t c a r white magic, seance experiments •, astrology are but the thin edge of wedge into the realm of satanism , i should be studiously avoided by c dren and adults alike.

Why this book was written 

Billy Graham, known as the world’s most famous Protestant preacher, was born in 1918 in Charlotte, N.C. A reli­ gious convert at sixteen, be groomed himself for the pulpit by practicing before squirrels and frogs. 

Ordained as a minister of the South em Baptist C hurch, he started as a radio preacher in Chicago, where he was an overnight success. In 1943 he was invited to the White House by 

Harry Truman and later became a close friend of Richard Nixon. 
Regarding the subject of this book, 
“Angels,” he says: “ When I decided to preach a sermon on angels, I found practically nothing in my library. 
Upon investigation, I soon discovered that little had been written ou the sub 
Ject in this century. This seemed a strange and ominous omission. Book stores and libraries have shelves of books on demons, the occult and the devil and bls demons. Therefore, I un­ 

 dertook a Biblical study of the subject of angels. Net only has It been one of the most fascinating studies of my life, but I believe the subject Is more rele­ vant today than perhaps at any time in history. 

“ In the midst of the world crisis through which we are destined to live in the years ahead, the subject of an­ gels will be of great comfort and in­ spiration to believers in God — and a 
• challenge to unbelievers to believe."

Law 'n’ order Nabers isn’t what he appears 

Bv LEE JONES 
ASSOCIATED MESS 

AUSTIN - It looked like a stacked deck when Speaker Bill 
Clayton made Lynn Nabers of 
Brownwood chairm an of the 
House Criminal Jurisprudence 
Committee. 
There was C layton’s — and Gov. 
Dolph Briscoe’s — anti-crime package, which liberals said was a Draconian effort to get tough with criminals on the cheap and without due regard for civil rights. 
And there was the current chairman, black Rep. Craig Washington of Hous­ ton, who is so liberal that he attempted last session to legalize homosexual re­ lations between consenting adults. 
“They’re intent on getting that (ex­ pletive deleted) out on the floor,” Wa­ shington rem arked after the appoint­ ment was announced. Since then, he’s changed his attitude toward his pudgy, drawling replacement. 
T here’s no doubt Nabers is a law- and-order conservative. 
But being for law and order doesn’t mean Nabers uncritically accepts the 
Briscoe-CTayton bills. 
Commitments 
“ I don’t guess I am committed to anything,” Nabers said in an inter­ view. A moment earlier, he had been talking to a man wearing a large tin button depicting un X-ed out electric chair and bearing the words, “ Thou 
Shalt Not Kill.” 
This was the day when Nabers would preside calmly and even-handedly over a hearing on several bills to repeal the death penalty. You had to get in line to talk with him. 
The 36 year-old B a p tist Sunday school teacher favors the death penalty and believes those who oppose it this session are “ kind of spitting in the wind.” 
N abers said the C layton-B riscoe bills, with their emphasis on changes in crim inal court procedures, don’t fully deal with the problem of crime. 
” 1 think the bigger issue is rehabili­ tation,” he said. 
Brave 
Quite a statement for a conservative to make at a time when even liberal li*nologists are becoming punitive. 

REP. LYNN NABERS 

*‘1 don’t b e lie v e w e ’ll do t h a t / ’ N abers said w ith a laconic sm ile th a t said he k n e w and you k n e w th e re w asn ’t any point in forcing a flo o r v o te on th a t p o w - d e rk e g issue. 
“ H e ’s not a lib e ra l by any stretch o f the Im a g in ­ atio n , but he Is a populist kind o f guy . . . He is a decent p e rs o n /’ W ash in g ­ ton said. 

His committee already has voted to increase the Board of Pardons and 
Paroles budget to reduce the average parole officer’s caseload from 75 to .Hi 
C layton and B riscoe w ant such things as w arrants to search for evi­ dence that m ight incrim inate a s u ­ spect, the use of oral confessions iii court and legalized wiretapping. 
I “ I sure have mixed emotions about 

 wiretapping and oral confessions. If those bills come out of my committee, 
I think they will be workable, practical bills as far as possible,” Nabers said. 
As for the evidentiary search war­ rants, “ I have problems with that bill 
I don’t think we need a fishing expedi­ tion.” 
Spend 
Nailers, whose clients in his Brown­ wood law practice range from former 
Ll. Gov. Ben Barnes to accused killers, said the way to light crime is spend some money — a no-no this session — to increase the number of courts and strengthen district attorneys’ staffs 
“ (le t’em tried, g e t’em appealed, get’em over with As a deterrent to crime, you’ve got to get people tried, and to do that it takes investigators, prosecutors and courts,” he said 
He also supports a lull, costing more than $5o million over the next two years, to establish a statewide proba­ tion system in place of the often weak local systems operated by tax-starved county governments. 
Washington remains on the criminal jurisprudence committee and now says it doesn’t look as if the Clayton-Briscoe bills are greased after all. 
“ I think he Nabers is going to assure that the bills that came out are fair, He is not going to lay down, roll over, play dead and let all those bills come out,” said Washington. 
Barnes 
Nabers was elected to the House i i i 
1968, the year B arn es gave up his 
House seat and the speakership to run successfully for lieutenant governor, 
B arnes d id n ’t help his c a m p a ig n . 
Nabers said, but the two have a strong relationship “ both professionally and as good friends,” 
When Nabers fir^*t came to the House he probably got noticed first for his pecan thrashing bills — one that pro­ voked a lot of lau g h ter before it passed. Iii essence, it prohibited the use of long poles to knock pecans off trees growing on state highway rights of way. 
Nabers is taken seriously now, lioth as com m ittee chairm an and part of 
Clayton’s inner circle. 
His style and philosophy differ 18o degrees from Washington’s Would the committee send to the floor another 
Jtiill legalizing homosexual relations?

Good planning is essential 

R esp on se at h earin gs on planning for community growth over the next two or three de­ cades indicates general public support for com p reh en sive planning. 

Bexar County commissioners are seeking authority for county zoning, for exam ple, to avoid nuisance conditions that hurt otherwise unprotected residents who live outside of incorporated towns or cities in the county. 

An earlier move to limit in­ stant slums on fringes of Texas cities w as a law giving cities certain zoning power in a five- mile-wide band beyond city limits. This extraterritorial jur­ isdiction used to require stan ­ dards for installing w a ter mains, sewers, roads and other utilities. 

Because of federal law relat­ ing to water quality goals of the national government, cities — 
San Antonio — are completing 
•initial planning work aimed at reclaiming rivers and stream s. 
San A n to n io ’s planning c o m ­ mission has sent to City Council its proposed guidelines for fu­ ture growth patterns. These gui­ delines will become basis for extending sewer lines to handle growth for the next 25 years. 

Projected growth, by location as well as by population, is ne­ 

 cessary in order to commit funds to pay for sewer lines and treatment facilities. 

The lively debate over pro­ jections is part of the planning p ro cess. A nother p art is the continuing deadlock over City 
Water Board line-extension po­ licy. An earlier policy designed to serve the extraterritorial a r­ ea, as well as the city, was sig­ nificantly a ltered . That early policy conceded the city would require a la rg e r rate base in order to finance a surface water supply for the fu tu re. Such funding has been compromised by the new policy. 

Thus, the central issue of the planning debate is how to allo­ cate fairly and responsibly the public costs involved in meeting future grow th re q u ire m e n ts. 
Another issue, more explosive to most San Antonians, is how to protect the water quality in the aquifer in the face of pressure to extend urban growth into the aquifer’s recharge zone. 

The planning commission’s growth sketch is a carefully-de­ veloped first phase designed to guarantee adequate sewer ser­ vice in a r e a s of p rojected growth. It is responsible plan­ ning and, in our judgment, ne­ c e s s a ry to the c o m m u n ity ’s long-term best interests.

Penetrating senators’

Fam ily planning as sub for abortion 

President Carter told a town hall meeting in Clinton, Mass., last week that his w elfare re ­ form plans will include a pro­ vision for “ a p erm an en t, n a­ tionwide system of family plan­ ning” to deter abortions. 

Ile promised the welfare re­ form proposals by May I. 

Massachusetts has been one of the toughest resisting states on the m atter of family planning and it was fairly typical of Mr. 
Carter to announce his goals on that issue in that state. It may be recalled that he outlined his draft-resisters’ pardon plan be­ fore an organization of war ve­ terans. 

The abortion issue was one of 
Mr. C arter’s most-difficult ones of the election campaign. He had prom ised to try to prevent fe­ deral funds from being used for abortions. His remedy is to try to m a k e abortion s-of-conven- ience less numerous through fa­ mily planning. 

T h e public p roblem — in d o llar te r m s — of unw anted child ren is directly related to poverty and ignorance. Welfare fam ilie s which rem ain in the poverty cycle for m ore than a 

 generation or two are the prob­ lem welfare cases. They either lack the ability to break the cy­ cle or find a life style on welfare a desirable or, at least, accep­ table way to live. 

Reforming welfare laws and practices will be a tough chal­ lenge, but family planning ef­ fectively a d m in iste re d is im portant in trying to reduce the welfare rolls. 

Abortion rem ains an essen­ tial practice in selected cases. 
Laws against abortion had been too narrowly drawn for too many y e a rs and the relaxation is a public gain. E ffectiv e fam ily planning — for all persons — is just com m on sense education for their economic welfare and the good of the offspring they have planned to give a home and a chance to live in relatively-as­ sured safety and family securi­ 

 t y . 

Mr. ( 'a r t e r h a s n ’t defined term s for the family planning aspect of welfare reform, but we suppose it will have some sort of motivation requirement in it. It seems clear that a public that will support its welfare clients should set constructive rules for their generosity. 

A couple of Bexar County's state senators are playing a le­ gislative game that needs to be explained to those whom the la w m a k e rs think they a re fooling. 
The Kame revolves around Senate 
Hill 815, an obscene little bill which would raise interest charge ceilings on small loans. It would also do a number of other nasty things to those of us who buy on credit. Opponents call SBH 15 the loan shark bill. 

But the bill isn't the point here. The point is how our senators are reacting to it. 

Last week SBtilS's sponsor, Sen. Don 
Adams of .Jasper, tried to bring the bill up for consideration in the Senate. He failed by a narrow margin and will probably try again. 

Of the B exar County delegation, 
Sens. Glenn Kothmann and F ra n k 
Lombardino voted in favor of bringing up SB 815. Not in favor of the bill, mind you, just in favor of bringing it up for consideration. 
I dunno 
Kothm ann, apparently feigning wide-eyed innocence if not ignorance, told reporters in explaining his vote, “ I still have not had a chance to know what it s all about it." 

 lf that’s true then maybe Kothmann ought to stay home and read up on 
SBH 15, or at least abstain until he knows what he’s voting on. Maybe then he’d remember his favorite campaign boast, that he likes to kill bad bills. 

Sen. Lombardino, however, appears to be taking a more straightforward approach. "My position is clear on this issu e.” he declared to an E xpress- 
News reporter last week. " I ’m against the bill.” 

Well, baloney, 

 cuftmy a n yone . 

Jim 
Dolan 

Sun d ay Editor c 

Against the bill Lombardino may be, but why did he vote in favor of bringing it up? And why did Kothmann? And why will they probably get away with it without facing their c o n stitu en ts’ wrath? 

Because they are doing a pretty good job of hiding behind protective Senate rules, that's why. 

Texas senators have entangled their upper house in a set of barnacle-en­ crusted rules which seem to defy logic. 
In reality they are eminently logical from a politician’s viewpoint. 

The rules allow and sometimes even encourage senators to vote both sides of an issue. That’s a fine way to build an all-purpose voting record and play power games at the same time. 

Ask any senator in Lom bardino’s position to explain what’s going on and you will probably be told, ‘T m just voting to get the bill up for a fair hearing. Then we can kill it. I just want to give Adams his chance.” 

I ’ndcr the rules, senators must ap­ prove with a simple majority vote any bill they are passing. But to get most bills to that up-or-down final vote stag e, they have to obtain rules suspensions. 

Suspensions require a two-thirds vote of senators present. 

Thus it often takes more votes to bring a bill up for consideration than it 

 does to pass that same bill. 
Adams' hour of need for SBH15. then, is really note. Once he gets SB815 up for consideration then a few of his col­ leagues can vote against him without hurting the bill. 
He’s wily 
Adams is a powerful senator, a wily man and someone senators find it ne­ cessary to get along with in his position as chairman of the Senate Adminis­ tration Committee. 

Members of the Senate power club understand that Adams needs all the votes he can get on SBH15's procedural vote. And if SB815 is unpopular back home, as it may very well be, that’s quite all right. 

Senators can simply announce that the procedural vote isn’t the “ real” vote, and that they will certainly vote against that bad o l’ bill when the 
"real” vote comes up. 

So the game goes on, and if SB615 p asses, we pay. 
T h is happens hundreds of times each legislative session when countless bills are voted on and countless political favors are exchanged. 

Lombardino can go ahead and pro­ claim that his stand on the SB615 issue is clear hwen it really isn’t, and Koth­ mann can go ahead and shrug off his 
.vote as something he didn’t under­ stand. 

But a basic law of legislative tactics is this: 

 lf M o i a n * re a lly against a hill, you k ill it UUY n a y you can, a n y w h e re you c a n a ru i a n y tim e y o u c a n , in the co m m itte r> o r on the f l o o r o r tm a prat etlural point, 

Those who say they are against 
SB815 but vote with its sponsor any­ time on the bill are being a lot less than truthful with their constituents.

Bullock’s reply 

Sir: On page 2-H of your Sunday, 
March 13, edition is the following item: 
WILL BULLOCK RESIGN SOON? 
"Rumors persist here about the im­ pending resignation of 
State 
Comptroller Bob Bullock . . some sources say Bullock’s resignation for health reasons may only be a matter of days away.” 
I am sick. I’m sick and damned tired of reporters questioning me about my health, receiving emphatic denials, then still writing items that infer otherwise. 
I told your reporter. Robert Ochoa, that I ani not sick, that I am not going to resign and that, in fact, I am consi­ dering announcing in the near future my plans to run for reelection. He chose to use nothing I said even though, I might point out, he is the first reporter I have told about my pending reelection announcement. 
I again reiterate, even though it may disappoint Mr. Ochoa: I am not sick. I am not dying. I am not going to resign. 
I enjoy my work and plan to keep on doing it so long as it pleases me and the voters of Texas. 
Bob Bullock 
Comptroller of 
Public Accounts 

Editor’s note: Apparently Comptroller 
Bullock did not see reporter Ochoa’s story about Bullock’s reelection plans, which was published in last week’s 
Express. 
Apple George 

Sir: This is a letter concerning the death of Mr. George Kline, "Apple 
Ja c k ” as we called him in our youth. 
I felt at a great loss when I heard 
George had died a few weeks ago. I heard from my family that the Express and News ran an article on him, the day of his death Feb. ll, but that this article generally covered George’s outside and didn’t get to the George our family knew. I would like to tell what I saw in Mr. Kline. 
I’ve known George ever since I was four or five. My first memory is him giving me candy either at my dad’s store or on some downtown street corner. While I was growing up I thought George was just a funny old man, like most people exposed to him for the first few times. 
It wasn’t until reaching my teenage years that I developed an enormous respect for this unique man. His kind­ ness for those he loved and the chil­ dren he came across was inexhausti­ ble. The characteristic I admired the most in him was his ability to speak his mind without any hesitation or reser­ vation. He gave hell to those who usually needed it, including some mayors, councilmen, judges, police­ men and businessmen. 
George was someone who cared about San Antonio, its people, wildlife, and future. And with Mr. Kline’s death dies an era of San Antonio. 
Downtown and my fa th e r’s store 
(Fawcett Furniture) just won t be the same without George Kline.

Joh n Hill girds for The Big Battle 

Cave-ins 

Sir: It is interesting to note that the 
U.S. Dept. of Labor is concerned about the recent ditch cave-ins here that took the lives of four men. We have a son who works at Fort Ord, Calif., and in 
October he was almost caught in a ditch when it caved in on him. For­ tunately, only his leg was caught and his ankle sprained. 
It would be reassuring to a parent to know that the federal agency is con­ cerned about safety on federal bases as well as civilian situations. 
Mrs. Clyde Berryhlll 
Civil rights 

Sir. The puritanical Muslim leader, ilaamas Abdul Khaalis, can now add another title to his self-assumed one of 
’ Khalifa", that of Almansur in token of his victory over the forces of law and order in the District of Columbia. 
Only the petty and the carping would deign to hint that he violated the civil rights of his hostages in earning the title of "Victorious One.’’ 
C.K. Arnold 

Paddling 

T he political headlines last week dealt with City Hall, but some of the most decisive action was at the Austin and Washing­ ton levels. 
The event of the week may well have been a quiet agreement that brought 
Bob Heller, the Houston-based media magician, on board as a member of the campaign team being shaped by Atty. 
Gen. John Hill. 
Heller was retained as of mid-week and Austin insiders saw the move as bringing Hill very close to an irrevo­ cable decision to get into the race for governor. 
Especially suggestive is the fact that 
Heller was a key performer in the 1972 ca m p a ig n which put Gov. Dolph 
Briscoe into office.

Railroad Commissioner Jon Newton and Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz. 
The fact that the attorney general has made a commitment to him is signficant. It scents to mean that he is ready to go all out for governor, even if it means a head-to-head battle with 
Briscoe. 
“ Heller is an expensive item to have around if you’re not going to follow his advice,” muse one state politico. 
The developm ent confirm s what newsmen have suspected. 
H ill’s soundings and pulse-feelings iii a round of trips about the state in the past few weeks have been productive. 

One positive feedback: A Hill query went out to some 1,5(1o old contribu­ tors. As of this point there have been only three detections of Hill people to 
Briscoe.

As expected for some tune, Garry 
Mauro, who left his post as No. 2 man to State Comptroller Bob Bullock at the start of the year, joined Krueger’s staff here. 
Local politicos learned three years ago that Mauro is one of the most ta­ lented political managers and organ­ izers in the state. 
That was when he directed the troops iii 
Krueger’s surprise victory over 
Nelson Wolff in the Democratic con­ gressional primary, and followed with a repeat performance in the general election battle with Republican Diwig 
Harlan 

Mauro has long made no secret of his belief that Krueger should chal­ lenge Republican Seu 
John Tower next year. It is doubtful that he would have rejoined the Krueger team unless he fully expected the congressman to bid for the higher office. 
Still hurts 
City politicians are finding that the carving of San Antonio into IO compact districts hasn’t reduced their costs of campaigning all that much. 
Part of the problem, of course, is the swift inflation of campaign costs. And sortie of the crucial new tools of politics carry high price tags, as well. 
One council campaigner who has a good track record reports that it will take $13.o(1o for him to mount a mo­ derate campaign. 
"Ju st a ’walk list’," he comments, 
"costs $5oo." 

He was referring to computerized lists of a district’s voters, broken down by street numbers — an essential tool for candidates who want to doorbell their precincts 

Not only thai, but the district-type race virtually rules out a television campaign as a wasteful luxury Mailed literature becomes a vital means of approach to voters. 

Yet candidates can no longer resort to cheap bulk m ailings. They must panic a full-cost 13 cent stamp on every item — up from K cents in campaigns just a few years back. 
Take such an essential for a grass roots campaign as yard signs. Not only is the cost of printing rising, hut the wooden stakes used for mounting signs now cost It) to 18 cents each. 
"They used to cost a dime,” reports the discouraged candidate. 

With TV too costly for most district candidates, the approach to air war­ fare should be through radio. 
But there are big problems in that area, too. It seems that the most po­ pular “ kicker" stations have decided not to sell time to council hopefuls. 
Arid Spanish-languuge stations are reportedly swamped with demands of the mayor’s race alone. 

Sir: Sunday’s paper (M arch 13) states that a South Texas school prin­ cipal was humiliated when he was arrested for paddling a 1o-year-old's bottom. 
Oh, how terrible, since it happened to him, a dyed-in-the-wool gringo. 
It does not say what the child had done, or what the problem was. But no 
1o-year-old child should be paddled by a principal or teacher. 

 lf one knows about some child being punished or anyway abused by the parents, call police or do something, get involved, don’t just stand there saying, oh, isn’t that terrible 

When I was going to school, a bearded principal paddled my bottom raw for not being able to make a music symbol on a blackboard. I still re­ member his name. 
He was a huge bruiser. I try after all the years to not hate tile man, only his act. but to no avail.

ERA 

Sir: 
In response to 
"A n oth er thought about the (ERA ” from Marion 
Beadles — it is a fact that Congress in 
1945 was considering drafting women for the armed services; however the end of the war brought the matter to a halt. Had the war continued, women would probably have been drafted — and there was no ERA. With or without 
ERA, women can be drafted if the U.S. 
Congress so decides.

Taxpayers tend to trip over two sorts of tax provisions — the rules that have changed since last year and the rules that ha­ ven’t. With the 1976 Tax Reform 
Act, an unusually large number of tax provisions affecting 1976 returns w ere revam ped. A c­ cording to tax accountants and the Internal Revenue Service, many taxpayers among the ear­ ly filers are mishandling some of them. 
By the same token, some tax rules cause problems in season and out. Sidney Ross, a tax partner with Main Lafrentz & 
Co., a national accounting firm, helped The New York Tim es revise and freshen thi<$ list of common tax errors from past years. 
K ale Schedules 
Failing to use the new tax tables co rre c tly w here ta x ab le incom e 
(rather than adjusted gross income) is 
$2o,ooo or less. 
Using the wrong tax table. For ex­ ample, a m arried taxpayer filing se­ parately but m istakenly using the table for single people. 
Using figures from the wrong line or column of the right tax table. 
Claim ing surviving spouse status without qualifying. A surviving spouse must maintain a household for a de­ pendent child or children. 
Failing to claim head of household status. For example, if a taxpayer supports an aged mother in a nursing home, she is a dependent, and the taxpayer is head of household. 
Trying to claim a standard deduction or low income allowance against un­ earned income on a dependent’s re­ turn. A dependent can only make the claim against earned income. 
E xem ptions 

Forgetting to note a change in the num ber of exem ptions applicable. 
Failing to compute the general tax credit correctly. It is the greater of $25 an exemption or 2 per cent of the first 
$9,ooU of taxable income. 
D ividends and Interest lf gross dividend or interest income exceeds $4oo, failing to file Schedule B. 
Claiming the wrong dividend exclu­ sion or none at all. 
Not determ ining the non-taxable portion of certain utility dividends. 
Improperly claiming as dividends the earnings from building and loan association, savings or other thrift accounts. They are interest income. 
Failing to report the interest or dividend income indicated im form 
1o99. The IHS is chocking them. 
Sick Pay 

Failure to recognize that new rules on sick pay eliminate most employes who used to be eligible for the exclu­ sion. lf still eligible as disabled, attach a doctor’s certificate. 
Capital Cains and L osses 
Not taking a capital loss for worth­ less stock. 
Failing to deduct an uncollectible personal loan as a short-term capital loss. 

Income tax is bad enough without making mistakes 

Overlooking a possible capital loss carry forward. 
O verp ay in g by ta k in g a stock transfer tax as an offset against selling price (Schedule D) rather than as a tax expense deduction (Schedule A). 
M edical E xpenses 

Forgetting to deduct transportation costs related to medical needs. The mileage deduction is 7 cents a mile. 
Parking and tolls are also deductible. 
Being unaware that Medicare pay­ ments are deductible up to $83.4o a year — as medical care insurance. 
Failing to enter on line 5 of Schedule 
A the excess of medical care insurance not claimed on line I. 
Failing to offset medical expenses by the amount of any reimbursement. 
Failing to deduct medical expenses paid for an individual who does not qualify as a dependent but for whom more than one-half of support is pro­ vided. 
Stale and 
Local T axes 
In using the table to compute sales tax deductions, failing to add taxes for large purchases, like a car or boat. 
Neglecting to add local taxes which are footnoted in tax tables. 
In computing the sales tax deduc­ tion, failing to add to income shown on line 15c of the first page of Form 1o4o any non-taxable income, such as Social 
Security receipts, disability income of the untaxed portion of long-term capital gains. 
Failing to deduct part of state or city income taxes paid last year — through withholding, estimated tuxes or defi­ ciencies paid at filing. 
Claiming a deduction for paying someone else’s tax liability. No m atter how close the relationship, that is not allowed. 
C ontributions 
Not realizing that transportation in this context is also deductible, at seven cents a mile plus parking and tolls. 
Overlooking out-of-pocket expenses for charity, such of the cost of special uniforms. 
Failing to value charitable gifts of short-term stock at the taxpayer’s cost and of long-term stock at fair market value when donated. 
Interest E xpense 

Forgetting to deduct credit card finance charges as interest. 
F ailin g to take a deduction on 
“ points” paid to mortgage lenders. when they are charged for the use of money. No deduction is allowed on points for specific services performed by the lender. 
Neglecting to claim a public utility's late paym ent charge us deductible interest. 
Failing to pro-rate the deduction of pre-paid interest over the life of the loan. 
» 
Casualty Losses 

Failing to realize that the $1oo offset for deductible casualty losses does not apply to business property or to pro­ perty held for the production of income 
(such as securities). 
Adding the $1oo offset instead of 

 subtracting it. 
Forgetting that the casualty loss may not exceed the cost of the proper­ ty. 

H om e O ffice and 
R ental V acation 
H om es 

Continuing to take deductions with­ out checking the severe restrictions enacted in the Tax Reform Act. 

Standard 
D eduction 

Itemizing when the standard deduc­ tion would mean less tax. 
Incorrectly computing the standard deduction by line 44b. Both percentage standard deduction and low income allowance increase. 

Incom e A veraging 

Overlooking the benefit entirely, not realizing that one may qualify by virtue of a rapidly rising income. 
Failing to realize that long-term capital gains and gambling winnings qualify for income averaging. 

T ax Credits 
Failing to claim an earned income credit. 
Improperly making an entry on line 
27 if an overpayment is entered on line 
2o and is to be refunded. 
Being unaware that a credit up to 
SI .IMM) may be claimed for hiring a former recipient of welfare or aid for dependent children. 

Child Care 

Failure to recognize that it is a credit now, rather than an itemized deduction. 
Failure to realize that many more families may qualify for the new credit than for the previous deduction and that the credit applies to all of 1976

City living is his dream 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DALLAS — “ Inner city” pro­ vokes im ages of squalor and crim e, jam m ed-togeth er dwellings and people circled in a seedy wagon train against the glittering nearby skyscrapers. 
But Dallas hom ebuilder Davis Fox conjures up a different picture — one of pleasant homes in suburban a m ­ bience and of ex ecu tiv es stro llin g leisurely to work in nearby office buildings. 
Dallas doesn’t have — in classic terms — an “ inner city.” but the area about a mile aud a half east of down­ town conies close. 
It is this area — a hodgepodge of ear lots, vacant lots, a few a p a rtm en t houses and fewer single family dw ellings — w here Fox is co n c en ­ trating his new project. 
• The president of Fox & Jacobs began acquiring property in the area three years ago at a tedious pace. Because the 36o pieces of property in tin* area 

'A compact little jewel" 

*o that’s w here the jerk cam e from 

WASHINGTON — One of the many scientific controversies rag­ ing in the country right now has to do with genetic research. It appears possible that, in the not too distant future, geneticists will be able to 
Join genetic material from different organisms in combinations un­ known to us today. 

Where the genetic research will lead no one knows. The scientists claim the unlocking of genetic se­ crets will benefit mankind in its fight against disease. The other school says they’re messing around with something they know nothing about and could come up with the 
Werewolf of London (no disrespect to the Anglish, of course). 

It is a worrisome thing to eon template and I must admit I’m rather nervous about it. At the same time, if done right, the commercial possibilities are infinite. 

The >ear is 198a and we’re visiting the showroom of Genetic Labora­ tories, Inc., where the salesman in a white jacket is showing us around. 

“ You really have a nice selection of people,” I say. 

"We’re wholesale,” he warns us. 
“ We don't take orders for less than a gross.” 

“I understand,” I reply. “ Could I see some of the models?" A beauti­ ful blonde in a low-cut gown conies out. “ Why, that looks exactly like 
Angie Dicksonsop!” I exclaim. “ It is an exact replica, including the same color eyes, hair and skin tex-

 lure. Ifs one of our most popular models. Sears Roebuck features it in their catalogue. We’re turning out 1o,ooo a month.” 

“ Fantastic," I say. “There should be one in ever) home.” 

“ Here is our Robert Redford me del. He is also one of our best sellers. We put an advertisement in 
Cosmopolitan and we’ve had back orders (or six months.” 

A tall man in a Green Beret uni­ form cam e out from behind the screen. 

“ You haven’t duplicated John 
Wa>ne?” I say in astonishment. 

“ Down to the twang in his voice. 
The U.S. Army has ordered 25o,ooo and the U.S. Marines will take all we can make.” 

“ What a breakthrough,” I tell him. “An Army and Marine Corps made up of John Waynes Is invin­ cible.” 

“ Ihe government seems to think so. We’re not allowed to sell any lo 

 foreign powers." 

“ I should hope not. Is that O.J. 
Simpson I see over there?" 

“ T h a t’s c o rrec t. T hrough the m iracle of science every football team in the countrv can now have an O.J. Simpson in the backfield. 
We have a license with the National 
Football League to duplicate him, for a rovalty, of course.” 

“ And 
N ureyev, the b atle t dancer?" 

“ We Just cam e out with him . 
We're hoping to do a big promotion job at Christmas when every ballet com pany docs ’The N u tc ra c k e r 
Suite.’” 

"A re im e>es deceiving m e," I say, “ or is that Lassie sitting over there?” 

The salesman replies, “ They said we couldn't do it, but we can now turn out 1,ooo Lassies an hour. I don’t think th ere is a I a i i i i I > in 
America that doesn't have one.” 
“ lad me ask >ou something. Have 
>ou ever tried to duplicate someone and come up with a m inster?" 
"Off the record?” he asks. 

“ My lips are sealed." 
“ Someone in the lab once acci­ dentally mixed the genes of Jack the Ripper with a donkey aud we had a catastrophe.” 

“ What was the result?” 

“ We reproduced Id! Amin,” 

 have 3oo owners, land acquisition has netted Fox only 3o of the 7o acres he feels are necessary for project. 
"W e’re still optim istic,” Fox said. 
“ But if we don’t have the land to start building sometime in 1978. then we’ll just forget about it." 
Fox is convinced there is a market for homes in the $4o,ooo $8o,ooo price range that are close to the city’s work center downtown. He admits a lot of his colleagues think he’s wrong 
The City of Dallas would like to see 
Fox succeed. 
City fathers would like so much to see such a project, they’ve entered into an agreement wherein the city would buy hack the land from F’ox should things fall th ro u g h , lf the project works. F’ox kl cps the laud and pays a penalty. 
“ We su re would like to pay that penalty,” F’ox said. 
The city’s offer was nut tailor-made for F'ox, but was intended to entice a builder into a downtown restoration. 
One of the preconditions was that such 

 a project be within two miles of what is considered the heart of downtown. 
“ Our conception is that it s where people want to go," F’ox said. “ The - option just hasn’t been available.” 
Because of the length of tim e in­ volved and the uncertainties of the economy and to other factors, the planned homes can be described only in the broadest terms. 
They will number 6oo-1 . ( M M I and will cost from $4o,ooo to $8o,ooo. Chances are they will have no more than three bedrooms. They will have small, per­ haps enclosed yards and will be* de­ signed to keep maintenance at a mini­ mum. There will be* no extraordinary security measures. “ We don't want to build a “ walled city," Fox said, be­ cause of their proximity to downtown. 
Little jewel’ 
“ We want to build a compact little jewel," F’ox said 
F’ox cited a “ regeneration of inter­ est" iii the downtown area, including a new hotel-plaza complex and a civie 

 square. "The odds are still tough. . . but there’s more happening downtown now,” he* said. 
Despite* the long and involved pro­ cess and the lifted eyebrows of some others in the business, Fox said the operation has been fun. 
“ We’re not trying to prove anything lo anybody,” F’ox said. “ I’m m ore convinced of tin* project’s success now than when we* started.” 

Chairman 
He is quick to point out that while he currently serves as chairm an of the 
Dallas Chamber of Commerce, the project was begun liefore he was a chamtier official. 
“There will be* no comdemnations or exercising of eminent domain rights,” 
F’ox said. “ We d drop it first.” 
Although F’ox said his concept of a compact home parallels the current switch to sm aller cars, the obvious energy-saving (mtential of living close to the job was “ not an overriding con­ cern.” 
Several people are watc hing with in­ terest, and Fox acknowledges inquiries about the project from other c ities. 
Business titans don’t like to reveal taxes 

The nation’s tax laws have sprung innumerable leaks and loopholes. More than half the money due the government es­ capes into the pockets of the privileged. The taxes they don’t pay must be made up by the rest of us. 

We thought the public* was entitled to know how much taxes the* nation’s top executives pay. F irst, we tried to identify the* corporale executives with the highest incomes. 
To do this, our staff inspected stock­ holder reports urn! other public* docu­ ments. 
Of course, the tax returns ol tin* lop executives aren’t open to the public. 
So we* simply called them and asked how much taxes they pay. 
The results were interesting. 
Tai* top paid executive iii the nation, so far as we could determine, is Me- shulam Riklis, ch a irm an of Rapul- 
A mer lea, a giant holding company. 

Nowhere 
Last year, he earned almost $1 mil­ lion But we got nowhere* with him. 
He refused even to return our calls.

Harry Gray, the chairman of United

He claimed he paid 55 per cent to 
Uncle Sam. This would add up to about 
$313,5oo.

Robert Anderson of Atlantic Rich­ field aud (‘buries Bludboru of Gulf and

 were personal and none of the public’s business. 
C D. Branch, chairman of Dow Che­ mical. earned $491.1)oo last year. He paid $313,357 of this, lie said, to the federal government 
So some of the nation’s richest exe­ cutives paid a fair tax. 
Others, we suspect, did not. The rest of us had lo pay the taxes they didn t pay. 
We d o n ’t sec* m uch d iffe ren ce between paying their taxes and giving them outright welfare. lf we were paying them welfare, we would have the right to know how much. But when we pay their taxes, it s kept sec ret from us.

'The Kingfish’ sparks furor 

N fW SD A Y 
In the history of American p olitics, probably no other fi­ gure has been the subject of more hostile labels than the populist-oriented Louisiana go­ vernor and U.S. Senator, Huey 
P. Long. 
He am assed power that reached as­ tounding proportions and. to this day, especially in the ru ra l a re a s of Lo­ uisiana, Long is still considered a folk hero. 
In an in cid en t th a t m ore than 4o y ears later is still m ired in eontro- 
\ e r s \ . Long's spiraling career cam e to a violent end when tie was gunned down iii the halls of the stale capitol in 
Baton Bouge. Ills alleged assassin, a y o un g d o c to r n a m e d C arl A u stin 
Weiss, was im mediately riddled with b u lle ts by Long s c o te r ie of b o d y ­ guards. 
E d w a r d 
A sn er s t a r s in a made-for-television movie, “ The Life and A ssassination of the K ing fish," which will be shown on the NIU -TV 
Monday at K p.m. 
The film focuses on Long s m urder 

 in 
1 o B5 a n d , th ro u g h f la s h b a c k s , chronicles his rapid rise to power and the m ystery surrounding the m otiva­ tion of his alleged assassin. Most of thi dram a centers on the final three years of the s e n a to r ’s life, follow ing him through cam paign tours and the fierce political infighting that generated en ­ emies for Long both in Louisiana and 
Washington. 
Location 
P roduced by T om orrow E n te rta in ­ ment, the “ NHC Monday Night at tin 
Movies” feature was shot entirely on location in Baton Rouge, including the actual site w here Long was killed, The controversy attached to Long was ren­ ewed recen tly w hen NBC a b ru p tly w ith d rew th e p r o g r a m fro m its schedule and then, a few hours later, reinstated it. 
Thomas Moore, president of Tom or­ row Entertainm ent, charged that NHC had pulled the show because of pres sure from liney Long’s son. Son. Bus­ sell B. Long (D-La.) chairm an of the 
Senate Finance Committee. 
Both NHC an d Long d e n ie d the charges.

Salinas said he, Ins parents and his coach. Earl 
Meyer, a re screening schools now “ I have to look at a lot m ore places yet. I want to talk to head coaches from now on. 
"I will not be going anyw here to visit for awhile. I would like to have the coaches com e here. Then, over sp rin g break in early April. I m ay take another few trills." 
T he Bulldog star. an E x p ress-N ew s unanim ous all-city player this year, is also a candidate for the all-secrecy team . He would not divulge the names of the schools he is considering. Ile would not even m ention the schools he has discarded. 
" I w ould ra th e r not say a n y th in g ," he stated. 
"O nce before I said som ething and my words came hack to haunt m c." 
S alin as, however, did say that he w as thinking about out-of-state schools.

Indications arc Kentucky. F lorid a. Notre Dame.

"I ju st do not want to say a n y th in g ." he said. m aintaining Ins vow of silence. 
P lay ers m ay begin to sign national letters of intent by April 13. but Salinas is in no hurry. 

"I really have until May fir J u n e to decide.’’ he reported. "I do not want to rush into things. I am studying each school. After all, I am going to live there for Hie next four years. 

"W hen I was younger. I never realized that lurk­ ing a college would he so com plicated, I figured you just took the school with the m ost prestige, the one that won the most.

Ta ro Ii na-Cha riot ti carved its niche am ong majot college basketball’s clite Satur­ day by stunning top-ranked Mi chivari 75-68 in the Mideast Re­ gional final of the NCAA bas­ ketball championships. 

" T h i s is just an u n b elief cab le e x ­ p erien ce,’’ said Lee Rose, coach of the

Nevada-Las Vegas, the top scoring team in th*- country at an average of 
1o8 points a gam e, pulled away from surprising Idaho State iii the second half and posted a 1o7-9o trium ph in the

The shocking upset of Michigan was the latest c h a p te r in C harlotte’s m e ­ teoric rise in the sport. The school of

It is recruiting season. And Salinas is a rare breed around these parts. He is the most sought-after high school basketball player in San Antonio history. 
And, q uite possibly, tile most sought-after athlete ever hero. 
His phone rin g s co n stan tly and th e re will be a s te a d y p a ra d e of college folks to his door soon. In fa c t, th e r e h a v e b e e n so m e 2(1(1 schools that have contacted him al­ ready. 
“ Sure, it has changed my way of life," Salinas said, w aking from a short nap to answ er this reporter s phone call. "I would like to be abit* to slip out to a movie, but I have to put e v e r y t h in g a s i d e an d think 
O’K E E F F E about my college p lan s.” 

Salinas, the all-time scoring leader in the city’s history with 2.11(12 points, enjoys all this attention, though. 
"It is a good feeling having everybody calling on m e." he said. "I know there a re a lot of guvs out there who arc just sitting ut hom e and w aiting.” 
L im ited to just six visits to various colleges. Sa­ linas is being very selective. He has taken one trip, journeying to the Texas-EI Paso cam p u s last week. 
"It is a nice place,” Salinas said of U T E ?. "And they run the sam e defense (m un-to-m an) we did at B urbank. Coach (Don) H askins is a good coach and they will be needing people next season.

 between the two team s. The four games were decided by a total of 17 points. 
The first significant break came in the final 1:25 of the first half when the 
Cavs ran off eight straight points for a 
51-42 halftime edge. 
Two steals and subsequent layups by 
Foots Walker sparked that surge 
A 2o-6 run by the Spurs over the first half of the third quarter gave them a 
62-57 lead. But the shooting of Jim 
( hones pulled the Cavs ahead by one, 
67-66, after three, and it was close the rest of the way. 
“ We couldn't put the hall in when we got up,” said Spurs’ Coach Doug Moo. 
“ In fact. Elmore (Smith) was the only guy from either team who could put the ball in at the end. 
“ He was the difference." 
In 15 minutes of play, the seven-foot 
Smith scored 12 points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked three shots. 
“ Elmore played w ell," said Spurs’ center Billy Paultz, who had 17 points and 13 rebounds despite playing with a had cold. 
A missed shot by Larry Kenon and a 
24-second violation by the Spurs coin­ 

 cided with two futile trips downcourt by the Cavs with the score 89-88. E l­ more's short turnaround put Cleveland ahead by one with 1:o3 left. 
Paultz and Snyder traded missed shots, and then Gervin came rumbling down the right side on a fast break. 
Only Walker, eight inches shorter than the 6-7 Gervin. stood between Ice and the basket. 
Gervin’s 12-foot baseline shot hit the back of the rim with 19 seconds loft. 
Still the Spurs were only one down. 
Mike Gale tried to foul Walker, but missed, and had to tag Snyder with four seconds left Walker shoots 72 per cent from the line, Snyder cans 84 per cent of his. 
Kenon paced the Spurs with 28 points, while Ice added 2o. ( hones led 
Cleveland with 23 points, but made an early exit. 
( hones was called for an offensive foul by referee Earl Strom with 3:38 left, and then charged him, saying, 
“ You stupid bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep." 
“ I deserved one technical, but not two,” said ( hones, whose pair of tech­ nic als caused his ejection and cost him 
$225.

NEW O R L E A N S (A P ) 
— Three New Orleans 
Jazz basketball players returned home Saturday to be examined by the team physician after they were injured in a taxicab accident in 
Phoenix, 
Ari/ , a Jazz spokesman said. 
The players — for­ wards Aaron James. Bud 
Stallworth and Nate W il­ liam s — were injured when the cab they were 

 riding in crashed into another car Friday after­ noon. The spokesman said none of them ap­ peared to have broken bones but more X-rays will be taken here as a precautionary measure. 
Guard Jim M cElro y and center Otto Moore also were slightly injured in the collision but they are expected to be in un­ iform for Sunday's game

The spokesman said team managers have not received a copy of the accident report yet and don t know what caused the accident. 

But Jazz Coach Elgin 
Baylor told a reporter he heard the cab run a red light He said the cab was totally demolished. 

Trainer Don Sparks said Williams and M cEl­ roy were thrown against the dashboard, banging their knees. 
Moore reportedly hurt his hip. and Stallworth’s ankles were wedged under the seat. 

Jazz Executive Vice- 
President Barry Mendel- son said he doesn’t know whether the team would file a lawsuit because of the wreck. But he said the accident w ill be in­ vestigated because “ the success of of our club depends on the health and condition of its players."

 among the most fearless of NBA re­ ferees had a rough night. When Ger­ vin was awarded the free throws for 
( hones’ technicals. Strom led Ice to the* wrong basket. 
Earlier. Smith, angered by a call, grabbed Strom’s wrist. The mountain­ ous center drew a look that scared even him. 
When Moe argued a call in the first half. Strom came over to the bench and said. " I have a terrible headache, and all that shouting isn't helping it. 
You don't want to give me a complex. do you?" 
Kenon stole the ball and scored to pull the Spurs within one, 84-83. He adm itted, however, he was out of bounds on the claw another call which angered the Cavs. 
F itc h ’s club, m eanw hile, pulled within 2>2 games of the Spurs, and they are still a force in the Central ract* 
“ There’s going to be no easy draw in the playoffs," said Filch. “ Washington is an NBA power, and San Antonio is tied with them, so you know what that says. And Boston is always tough with their playoff experience. 
“ Who would I like to face? Call me in a couple of weeks if a couple of guys 

 break their legs. Then maybe I can give you a preference."

CORPUS CHRISTI — Alamo Heights won three matches and tied another over the weekend to win the Corpus Christi Spring Team Tennis Champion­ ships. 

The Mules stopped Victoria, 7-1; tied Corpus 
Christi Carroll, 4-4; whipped Churchill in the semis, 
6-2, then won a 5-3 title victory over Corpus Christi 
King. 

In the other semi, King tied U>e, 4-4. while in the third place match, Lee again tied 4-4, this time with 
Churchill 

Alt tie matches were decided on total games, with 
Heights bealing Carroll, King beating Lee and Lee getting the edge over Churchill. 
Each match had two boys singles, two girls’ singles, two boys doubles aud two girls doubles, 

Flight No. 432, providing dir­ ect service from Buffalo to 
Chicago, was descending towards O’Hare International when the captain came on the intercom. 

It was one of those landings that makes you feel like you're being sent over Niagara Falls in a barrel, so per­ haps the captain felt some information of note would soothe the passengers’ nerves. 
“ We thank you for flying with us today." he said. “ And we d especially like to welcome the San Antonio Spurs 
Soccer Club, who are also on board." 
It’s bad enough when a group of tall men traveling togeether are constantly asked if they are basketball players. 
One star, fed up with the oft repeated query, replied to a lady. “ No, I ’m no basketball player. I clean giraffes’ teeth for a living.” 
Skeptics aware 
True, hardcore basketball people knew of the Spurs’ potential before the season began. And since, many skep­ tics, especially in former bastions of 
NBA chauvinism like Philadelphia’s 
Spectrum and Madison Square G ar­ den. have become aware of the Spurs. 
" I remember when we were in Phi­ ladelphia to play the 76ers in the opener." says Spurs’ forward Allan 
Bn tow, once a 76er himself “ All they wrote about was getting Dr J. They didn t even mention who Philadelphia was playing." 
And you all remember the outcome til that game. 
As the Spurs have moved into con­ tention for the Central Division title, even the golden throats at CBS have decided the Spurs are worth viewing 
At the start of the season, the Spurs were scheduled for three regional telecasts. With three weeks left in the season. San Antonio has been on tele­ vision seven times. At least one more telecast, the game against Kansas City at the Arena March 27. will bt* tele­ vised. The starting tim e has been moved up to 12:45 p m. 
The director of C BS Sports. Herb 
Gross, says the television schedule that was devised right before the season

N EW YO RK (A P ) - 
Lonnie Shelton and Walt 
Frazier led New York to a 19-point lead in the first quarter and the Knieks held on to trim the At­ lanta Hawks 11)7*1o1 in a 
National Basketball As- soeiation game Saturday night. 
Atlanta, which trailed by at* many as 22 (joints in the second quarter, rallied behind forwards 
13*n Robinson and John 
Drew and pulled within lour with three minutes to go. 

 was tentative, at best. Sure it was. 
When Dr. J was with New York, CBS was ready to put the Nets on as often as 
Walter Cronkite 
"No one had any idea of how good or how bad certain teams would be," said 
Gross, “ what kind of injuries would come up. what kinds of trades would be made. It was certainly a tentative schedule. 
“ The Spurs have probably been on the second most times behind Phila­ delphia. Denver and Golden State are right up there, too." 
Why? 
“ Because the Spurs are exciting and good," (iross said. “ They are a con­ tender, so that's an easy question to answer.” W hat about the excitable na­ ture of the San Antonio fans? 
“ No, that really has nothing to do with it," (iross replied “ Better not tell them that, though, or they might scalp me. Hah, hah. hah.” 
The sad irony of this is the Spurs, like their three ABA counterparts, do not share in the money CBS pays the 
NBA for the rights to the telecasts. 
That package is worth $5o9,99(1 per team, so you can understand what that money means to a team’s finances as well as its chances of surv ival 
Concession 
One of the concessions the A BA learns had to make when they entered into the merger agreement was not to collect any television money for four years. 
Secondly, the A BA ’s constant strug­ gle and ultimate demise was attribu­ table. to a very large extent, to its inability to come up with a television package. If it’s not on television, it doesn t exist, right? 
Now two form er A B A teams are among C B S’ very best drawing cards. 
Indiana is not far away from being another one. 
All of this has to make you wonder if the N BA wasn’t just as lucky as the 
ABA when it came to merger, lf noth­ ing else. the infusion of talent has made the division races tighter than ever. 
Sure, the NBA always had that most powerful of weapons, a television con­ tract. But who would you rather watch. 
Julius Erving or Dale Schlueter?

— Tom Watson’s wildly-errutic, two-over-par 74 — including bo­ geys on two of his last three holes and an earlier double-bo- gey seven — was good enough to tie faltering Mike McCullough for the third-round lead 
Saturday in the $3oo,ooo Tour­ nament Players Golf Champion­ ship. 

McCullough, the outsider ut a field of tile game's greatest players, had held a surprising lead through the first tun rounds of this ambitious event.

Snead wheeled into position for a shot at the title in this annual championship of the touring players. 
Watson, already a two-time winner this year. and McCullough, who hasn t even challenged seriously i i i five years of tour aeti\ ity, were tied for the top al

Snakes surge to win 

Bv CLIFFORD BROYLES 
O f THE EXPRESS NEWS STAff 
The* St. M ary’s Rattlers proved once again Saturday that it is not how you play the game that counts, but whether you win or lose. 

The Rattlers rallied to beat Texas Lutheran. 1(1-9, at V .J. Keefe Field to open defense of their Big State 
Conference title on shaky ground. 
The game was not an artistic success on either side. unless you like abstract art. 
But nonetheless it counts as a win fur th** Snakes and a hitter defeat for the Bulldogs, who saw an 7-2 lead slip away as the marathon waddled along at a snail s pace. 
St Mary's led for the first time in th** game when 
.lules Monier scored the game’s decisive run in the last of the eighth on a wild pitch by Boy Mims, the last of three TLF pitchers. 
Not until Danny Hoop, the fourth St. M ary’s pitcher, put down the Bulldogs in order in th** top of the ninth, did any pitcher have a 1-2-3 inning 
Wild game 

It was a wild and woozy as the score sounded. 
T LF outhit the Rattlers. 15-1o, garnering a 13-3 edge iti hits over the initial four and one-half innings as an unpredictable wind played trick with fly hulls on both sides 
St 
Mary's scored a run or more in six of eight turns at iii** plat** while TLF scored in five of nine innings. 
Southpaw dreg Kruciuk. who allowed the Bulldogs two runs a ne! only one of them earned in four in­ nings. picked up the win for St. Mary's 
Been Maldonado, who relieved starter Bill Miller in th** sixth, suffered the defeat, although he carried a 9-6 lead into the bottom of th** seventh. 
Mims replaced Maldonado with the bases loaded and none out in the eighth, and except for th** wild pitch, did his job. ll** faced only three batters and struck out the first two. But the* damage had been done, 
St. Mary’s tied it 9-9 with three runs in the bottom of the seventh, after inching closer with two tallies each rn th** fifth and sixth 
Homer 

( Ilaclit* Migl’s two-run homer in tin* sixth pushed th** Rattlers within, K-H The towering drive, just to lh** left of th** solid hill** Centerfield wall. was Migl's second home run of the year and the only two hit by a Rattler this season. 
TLF opened th** lead to 9-6. in the top of lh** se­ venth after Mark Clark tripled and cam** home when 
Ronnie Acosta's grounder got past second baseman 
Baul Tejeda, who was drawn i i i tight 
An error by shortstop Kevin Ott ignited the Rattler outburst and M arty Zolkoski followed with a screaming double that scored Mike Zamora 

Baul S/ymarek's double, which was misjudged by the second baseman and fell between he and the rightfielder. scored Zolkoski. Migl’s single to right plated S/ymarek with the tying run. 
Molder drove in St. Mary's first run of the day with a bases loaded walk off starter Bill Miller, whose w ildness eventually caught up with him. 

Miller had a 7-2 lead going into the bottom of the fifth and had allowed only one hit. Szymarek's se- cond-inning triple But In* had thrown a ton of pitches

Gottfried in finals 

WASHINGTON (A B) — Bruin Gottfried ad­ vanced to the finals of the $1oo.OOO Grand Brix 
Tennis Tournament Saturday with a strong come-from-behind victory over his doubles partner. Haul Ramirez 
The No. 3 seed Gottfried, of Bonaventure. 
Fla., plays the winner of the Tom Gorman-Bob 
Lutz match in Sunday’s final, The winner will take away $2o,ooo. 
Gottfried defeated Ramirez, the No. 2 seed from Mexico, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 in a match that lasted 
2 hours 39 minutes, and had 14 service breaks, nine by Gottfried, out of a possible 29. 
The 25-year-old Gottfried, already the winner of two tournaments this year in Long Beach and 
Baltimore, started off slowly in the first set with an erratic backhand, but managed to come from 
Ix'ing down 4-2 to go ahead 5-4 before Ramirez 

 broke his service and went up 6-5. 
Gottfried tied the match 6-6 with two sensa­ tional points to break Ramirez, but the Mexican won the 12-point tiebreaker 7-4 
Gottfried broke Ramirez three times in the second and third sets. The third game of the second set went 21 points, seven deuces, before 
Ramirez held Ins service 

Ramirez said both played well in th** begin­ ning of th** match, “ but he got better in the end. 
He played a little better on th** important points and broke my serve.’’ 

Gottfried said Ramirez ‘ seemed lo Im* hang­ ing back in the beginning. The surface was slow and the flails were heavy...It was almost like clay. He feels he plays better from the baseline under those conditions.”

Schoolboy baseball 

The sweeping winds at Edgewood 
Stadium Saturday afternoon were not stiff enough to prevent the breaking of four records and the establishment of another in the girls’ division of the 
Edgewood Invitational Track and 
Field meet. 
After six marks fell by the wayside 
Friday in the field events and running prelims, the winning Holmes girls and 
McCollum’s half miler Kathy Ayala assaulted the record book once again 
Saturday. 
The Huskies’ 44(1 relay unit bettered a 51.o mark, which was set Friday, with a 5o.9 showing and smashed a year old standard in the mile relay w itll a 4:23.6 clocking. 
Holmes’ Karen Rucker broke a 26.o mark in the 22o. which she had set in the prelims Friday, by a tenth of a second with a winning effort Saturday. 
Ayala set the only other individual record Saturday with a 2:38.o finish in the 88o. 
While tile records were evaporating in the meet, two city bests were also established, both in Friday’s prelims. 
Robin Southern, of Kennedy put her­ self at the top of the list in the 8o-yard hurdles with an 11.1 time and Memor­ ial’s Verlena Mooney did the same in the 44o with a 58.9. 
The Holmes’ girls ran away with the team title with 169 points, while Lanier edged out Holmes (78Vi) and Wheatley 
(76) in the boys’ division with 94.

 training programs, the curriculum and the climate. 
I have to see how I will fit in the community. I am interested in the coach, the players and the disci­ pline. 
“ Even though my folks and Coach Meyer are helping me now . the final decision is mine.” 
Good grades 
Salinas, a B student at Burbank, said his grades have enhanced his value to schools. “ My grades have helped. I think if they had been lower, some schools would not have been as interested in me.” 
Gilbert said he wants to study business iii college, getting into personal finance work "I want to work with people," lie said. 
Although Burbank's season ended last weekend in the semifinals of the state playoffs, Salinas will he playing more basketball again soon. lie will compete at the Dapper Dan Classic in 
Pittsburgh on April I. Ile billows that with a per­ formance in the Midwestern All-Star game in Day­ ton, Ohio, April 2. 
Salinas is most excited about an all-star came May 
12 in Albuquerque, N M., against a team from Rus­ sia. 
Olympics 

“ it will be a lot like the Olympics," he said “ I think it will be a great experience for me. You see, I want to play in the 198o Olympics in Moscow." 
He is also ticketed for another all-star game in 
New York on May 27-28. However, Salinas will not play til the Texas High School Coaches All-Star game this July. 
“ There is a rule that if you play in that game, you can not play in any others,” he explained. “ But why should I only play in one game and miss the others.” 
Salinas, who is a sleek 185-pounder, believes his lack of bulk will not hinder him in college. 
“ I think as long as they cannot catch me, I am okay.” he laughed, referring to the 25o-pound tvpes who normally hang out under the basket, “ lf I move around, they won t he pounding on my head. I have to use my quickness and my finesse.” 
Salinas does not emulate any pro players, hut says others have compared hts style to Alvan Adams, second-year center for the Phoenix Suns. 
Hun ami pass 
“ People have told me that I run and pass like him,” Salinas said. “ Some folks have said I play a little like Bill Walton (former UCLA great and now center for the Portland Trail Blazers) did when he was younger. 
“ I admire the inside moves of George G en in 
(Spurs' star). His moves are incredible. He is so fluid " 
Salinas, a religious young man who indicated that 
Sunday morning Mass will continue to be a part of his routine, fancies a career in pro hall 
“ I think everyone who plays college basketball thinks of tin* pros." he said. "Who knows. I might even wind up with tin' Spurs someday." 
JC stars nam ed 

Seven players from Texas werejiamed Saturday to participate in the 3rd Annual National Junior Col­ lege players, who who will play on the East and West squads, were announced ut the National JC tour­ nament in Hutchinson, Kau.

HAMPTON. Ga 
(AP) 
— Veteran G.C. Spencer and rookie Jody Ridley, driving a Mercury pur­ chased last month from 
Roger Penske, turned in the two fastest qualifying times Saturday as time trials ended for Sunday's 
SI 7o. DOO 
Atlanta 
5oo 
Grand National stock car race. 
Spencer, an antique dealer from Bluff City. 
Tenn.. earned the 31st starting position with a speed of 159.353 miles an hour in his Dodge. 1oth fastest overall. 
RUI ley’n speed of 
158.735 m p h actually exceeded the qualifying speed of Penskc’s own entry here. put in the 
-12-car field Thursday bv 
Dave Marcis at 158.o48 m ph 
Improved track condi­ tions were credited with helping speeds climb Sa­ turday. 
Gusty winds hampered track activity 
Friday. Humid, warm weather prevailed 
Thursday when Richard 
Petty won the pole posi­ tion with a record-break­ ing run at 162 5o1 m p h. 
Two extra cars start because non-NASFAR drivers A J 
Foyt and 
Johnny Rutherford made the starting lineup. NAS­ 
CAR regulars Cecil OR­ 
DON AND Tighe Scott got the positions. 
Janet Guthrie was also one of the final 12 quail tiers. Her Chevrolet lost an engine in practice Sa­ turday morning, hut re­ pairs were made in time 

 tor her to make a quali­ fying run at 
157.5o3 rn p h. 
“ I felt some pressure because I ran 156 the first day. and only 153 yester­ day." Miss Guthrie said. 
"Naturally I wondered and fretted about that." 
Miss Guthrie said she changed her driving style 
Saturday, and that ap­ parently resulted in most of t e extra speed 
"Yesterday I tried to get through the turns without liftin g .” she said. “ It just didn't work. 
The car would drift to the 

 wall and I’d have to get out of the throttle to keep from crunching. 
Also Saturday. J A . 
Reins, who was involved in a spectacular wreck two weeks ago at Rock­ ingham. N C., took a runaway victory in a 
45-minute race for NAS­ 
CAR Baby Grand stock cars — compacts painted up as lookalikes to their 
Grand 
National big brothers.

Grote. ‘ lie s a good ballplayer. You can't take it away from him.” 
Maxwell, who got his nicknaiMt be­ cause he resembles the star of the movie “ Cornbread, Earl and Ale,” pro player .laniaal Wilkes, said he learned t»i handle the ball in the streets of his hometown, Kingston, N C . 
“ Street ball teaches something a coach can’t,” he observed. 
Best 
Rose called Maxwell the best player in the country, “ pound for pound," saying he “ does more things well than any other big man in the nation." 
Phil Hubbard, M ichigan’s center and a member of the Olympic gold medal team, agreed. “ Ile ranks right up there with the finest I saw all year," 
Hubbard said. 
The 49ers raced to a 4o-27 halftime lead, but Michigan got untracked after the intermission and pulled in front 
49-4H with 12:o8 to go. The two teams stayed close for tin* next seven minutes before Charlotte broke the game open with IO straight points to take a 73-o1 lead. 
Forward Lou Massey, who added 19 points for the 49ers, started the burst with two free throws with 5:o1 remain­ ing. Then guard Melvin Watkins hit a layup and with four minutes remaining to make it o7-61. Charlotte went into a stall, which led to two free throws by 
Maxwell and a layup and two free throws by freshman guard Chad Kineh that made it 73-o1 with 2:34 remaining and sealed the fate of the heavily fa­ vored Wolverines. 

26-4 
Michigan, beaten iii the NCAA finals by Indiana last season, finished with a 
2o-4 record. All-American guard Rick­ ey Green topped the Wolverines with 2o points. 
“ We had chances, but it just wasn't our day,” said Michigan Coach Johnny 
Orr. “ We tried to get the tempo going but it was difficult. We just didn’t seem to do it." 
North Carolina opened a 15-point lead in the first half and was ahead 
53-41 at halftim e before Kentucky pulled within six with 15 minutes to go, 
The Tar Heels then went to their four- corner offense and held on thanks to some stunning free throw shooting, hitting 33 of 3o from the foul line — including their last 21 in a row and IO straight in the second half. 
Seni John Kuester ran North Caro- lulus offense in the absence of injured, foul-plagued All-American Phil Ford and scored eight of his 19 points i i i the closing 5Mi minutes. 
Ford, playing with a painful hyper­ extended right elbow, committed his fourth foul in the first minute of the second half and went to the bench for good But Kuester took command and 

 sank four free throws in the final 72 seconds, after Kentucky closed to within 71-7o, to put the game away. 
“ The important thing is we kept our liaise,” said Kuester. “ Phil is the fin­ est guard in the nation. It's too bad we had to go without him.” 
Walter Davis led the Tar Heels with 
21 points, 15 of them in the first half. 
Jack (liven scored 2o points and led 
Kent ucky’s comeback. 
Work 
Marquette Coach McGuire, who has announced his retirement for the end of this season, will have to work an­ other week thanks to a second-half comeback that erased a 35-31 halftime deficit. 
Bo E llis led Marquette with 2o points, Butch Lee had 19 and Toone finished with 15. Je rry Schellenberg topped Wake Forest with 19 points. 
Nevada-Las Vegas, another schoyl which has climbed to national pro­ minence only recently and has never made*!he final four, trailed 52-51 at the half to unranked Idaho State, which had eliminated UCLA in its previous outing. 
But the Rebels pushed their running game into high gear in the second half and wore diiwn the Bengals. 
Forward feddie Owens, who scored 
13 of his 24 points in the second half, had a steal and a stuff shot, then forced another turnover and hit a jumper to move Nevada-Las Vegas to a o5-57 lead with 14:21 left and the Rebels were off and running. Eight minutes later, the 
Rebels were ahead by 21 and only a four-corner control offense in the final minutes kept the score down.

SAN H AN. P H (A P ) — Grinning and waving to a small crowd of fans, 
George Foreman strolled out of a local hospital Saturday a day and a half after suffering heat prostration and a mild concussion during his upset loss to Jim m y 
Young. 
The former heavyweight champion took time to autograph a picture for one of his supporters and chatted with several ;>f them before departing for his Texas ration 
The 28-year-old Foreman said he ll take at least a month off to rest before resuming training Ho said he was feeling fine and that he hadn't been hurt during the 12-round bout Thursday night with Young, a fight that has devalued his fortunes in the heavyweight picture. 
Foreman, looking relaxed in a blue jumpsuit, said he doesn’t expect any trouble in lining up another fight after his unexpected loss.

Racer dies in crash 

. heads for Texas 

SAO PAULO. Brazil (A P) - 
Carlos Pace of Brazil, off to a good start in what promised to be the best year of his Formula 
One racing career, was killed in a crash of a small plane near his home here Friday night. He was 
32. 

The Sao Paulo medical exam! er’s office said Saturday that Pace’s body was identified by fingerprints. Two others died in the crash of the single- engine plane. 
They were identified as Marivaldo 

Fernandes, the pilot, and Carlos Ito- berto de Oliveira. Fernandes, a former race driver, had helped Pace get his start in racing 15 years ago. 
Pace was flying to join his wife and their two small children at a farm near 
Araraquara, a city about nearly 2o1) miles from here. 

Pace had been taking flying lessons and only last Thursday had taken the written exams for his private pilot’s license. 
The race car driver was scheduled to leave Sunday for Long Beach, Calif., where he was to drive in a race April 3. 
Burial will be Sunday in San Paulo. 
Pace, who was under contract to the 

British Brabham racing team, had been tied for fifth in the World Driving 
Championship competition with fellow 
Brazilian Em erson F ittip a ld i, a former world champion, after three races this year. 
In Brands Hatch, England, on 
Saturday. Pace’s Brabham teammate, 
John Watson, qualified first for Sun­ day's Race of Champions 
' Yes, I knew Carlos was dead,” said 
Watson. “ I had been told before I went out to practice. Just when everything seemed to be going well for our team, something like this had to hajlp’rtV” 
Bernard Ecclestone. Brab ham 's managing director, said Watson would race Sunday.

I 
By DAN KLEPPER en 

OUTDOOR EDITOR 
Ultralight spinning tackle has its disadvantages, but miniature rods and reels, when matched with thread-like line and small lures, do something that more than balances the scales in their favor. 

T W O K IN D S of u ltraligh t tackle, o p e n -tace d spinning an a c lo se d -fa c e sp in cast, w e re u se d to catch these la r g e - m outh bass. The h e a v ie st w e igh e d 3 poun ds 4 ounces 

A L A R G E M O U T H is cau gh t su sp e n d e d horizontally in the air as it le ap s n e a r the b oat p h o t o s by d a n k lep p er 

They put a little extra fun in fishing. 
On ultralight, a four-pound fish is a prize, because the fish isn’t going to be cranked to the boat effortlessly. 
The fish will have to be played, and if it is to bt* caught, the an g ler's equip­ m ent m ust be first class and in top shape 
I lt r a lig h t sp in n in g g e n e r a l l y implies a rod weighing less than three ounces and a line with a breaking test of less than three pounds. 
Open 
T h a t s p id e r-w e b line is fin e for 
“ open” w ater where few su b m erg ed o b stru c tio n s exist. If an a n g le r can follow his fish, and if the line doesn’t becom e ab raidcd on an o b stru c tio n , if s possible to land a fish w eighing lh or 2o tim es as heavy as the pound test of tin* line. 
B u t w hen fish in g b r u s h - f i lle d w aters, I'm not brave enough to use su c h light line. I p re fe r so m e th in g h eav ie r, four to six-pound test, and even with this I know I'm going to lose som e lures and some fish 
I know. too, that a real trophy bass pf six pounds ar more probably will be lost in the brush, because even though the line, tin4 rod and reel a re quite capable of handling the fish, the b a ss is g o in g to dive for cover 
And if there is one thing light line won’t w ith sta n d , it's being dragged across a limb. 
Ultralight equipment cannot be used to “ horse” a fish away from obstruc­ tions. Once the angler is hooked up to a good fish, he can hang on and hope. Ile can ex ert pressu re on the rod in an attem pt to guide tin* fish in a certain direction, hut he cannot force the issue or the line will break 
His d ra g will not o ffer too m u ch help, because it should be set on the light side. If the slip clutch is set close to the breaking strength of the line, the angler is walking on thin ice. • 
He m ust rem em ber tlitit, first, the knot he has used to attach his lure has reduced to some extent the strength of the line. 
Second, the force req u ired to start the drag working is at right angles to the spool over the roller m echanism . 
T h e re fo re , all the im p a c t s tr a in is confined to a few inches of line. 

A N G LER using ultralight ta ck le lets the rod do m o st o f the w ork w h e n p la y in g a fish 

PHOTO BY DAN KLEPPER 
Never point the rod directly at fish 

If a line breaks at the reel, chances are the dra g is too tight or there is a rough spot on the reel itself. 
It is im perative that the angler cheek his line often for nicks, the first 12 to 18 inches in p a rtic u la r. T his is w here most of the nicks occur, especially if the fish is hi Hiked near obstructions or has w rapped the line around its fins or gill plates when jumping. 
The lure often becomes wrapped up in the line, and the points and barbs of hooks can nick the monofilament and weaken the line. 
F in ge r 

When fighting a fish with ultralight equipm ent, don’t crank the reel handle furiously If the fish is taking line, all you’re doing is creating a twist in the m onofilament, a twist that will come back to haunt vou. 

P u m p the rod with a slow , stroking motion. Gently sweep the rod upward 
— w ithout tu rn in g th e re e l h andle. 
( ra n k the reel handle a s th e rod is lowered to take up slack line. 
As the fish begins to tire and if you are using an open-faced spinning reel, press your forefinger a g a in st the spool and pum p gently. The elasticity of the line, coupled with the ben din g of the rod, acts like a shock abso rber. 
Never point the rod directly at the fish T his elim inates th e im p act a b ­ sorbing ability of the rod and puts line strain from the fish directly to the reel 
The result might be a broken line. 
If the fish refuses to g ive ground, prod it with gentle but firm pum ps of th e rod, nev er by t u r n i n g th e reel handle. 
Line twist which results from reeling against unyielding p ressu re can break

SPECIAL tO IME EXPRESS NEWS 

AUSTIN — Tilt* fur-trapping industry in Texas started to boom two or three years due to the swing back to clothing trimmed with natural fur. 
In 1975-78, th e T ex as P a r k s a n d 
Wildlife D epartm ent sold some 12.ooo trapping licenses, an increase of 2,(UMI from the previous year. Figures for the current y ear indicate that this rate of increase is continuing. 
An e x a m p le of the benefit to local econom ies is seen from records kept for 22 counties of west-central T ex as where there is heavy trapping. In this 

 region during the 1978-77 season a total of IHI..187 furs sold for m o re than $2 million. Value of the furs brought in th e p re v io u s y e a r a m o u n t e d to 
S1.2INI.UIMI. 
Raccoons head tin* list of an im als harvested for pelts. O ther m ajor furs are red and gray fox. coyotes and bob­ cats. Raccoon pelts sell for $11-24; red fox, $35; g ra y fox, $2o-25; coyotes, 
$15-25; bobcats, $oo-8o; rin g tails, $4-H and skunks. $2-3. 
Q uestion s have been ra is e d as to possible co nsequ ences of con tin ued heavy harvest of fo rbearers. Concern has been expressed th at tra p p in g or hunting pressure might lower popula­ tions of specific forbearers to the poult 

 of th e ir b ein g e n d a n g e re d and th a t there might be an explosion of rodents that n o rm ally a re kept in cheek by such predators. 
The odds against these eventualities are high enough that experts believe th e re is no re a l c a u se for an x iety . 
P r o b l e m s c o n fr o n tin g e n d a n g e r e d species are closely monitored and c u r­ rent indications are that trap p in g is not one of them . 
T he tr a p p in g boom is seen to be more beneficial than harmful, accord­ ing to Bill Brownlee, P&WD non-game program leader. F orbearers are prone to natural die-offs in the su m m er due to disease, parasites, or other factors, and culling the surplus each winter by 

 trapping actually leads to a healthier overall population. 
S ta tis tic s for ra c c o o n s , tin* m ost heavily trapped a n im als, point to an increase of seven per cen t in nation­ wide populations i i i the past year or so. 
Brownlee also pointed out that proba­ bly a large percentage of persons who buy tra p p in g lic e n se s a r e a m a te u r trap p ers who have relatively limited s u c c e s s. T he c o m p a r a ti v e ly sm a ll num ber of expert trap p ers do not pose a danger of overharvesting forbearers at this time. 

 light line. E v e n if th e line d o e s n ’t break, the tw ist causes the line to coil when the p ressu re is released, and the coils m aking eastin g a nightmare. 
Depending on the line and the rod. lures w eighing an eighth of un ounce and lighter can be used with ultralight equipment. A quarter-ounce lure is a real heavyweight. Many ultralight rods will handle only a q u arter of an ounce of w e ig h t o r le s s w ith o u t b e in g stressed to the b reak ing point. 
Although it m ight appear difficult to set the hook w ith this type of eq u ip ­ ment, in m ost cases the fish actually will do the hook setting when it strikes, and unless th e a n g le r lias too m uch slack in his line, tin* initial pressure of th e b a ttle i m b e d s th e hook p o in t beyond the barb 
It should bt* obvious that the u ltra­ light user doesn't attem pt to “ break a fish's neck,” as the saying goes. If he does, th e m o s t lik e ly thing he will break is his lint*.

On the strik e th e rod is swept u p ­ ward i i i a sm ooth motion without any harsh jerks that will pop the light line. 
This upw ard sw eep does no more than assist in taking up slack which might occur d uring the shrike and put pres­ sure on the fish

SPECTATORS watch arm-wrestling contestants during Saturday's action at North Star Mall. For results, 

Rangers fall 

POMPANO BEACH, Flu. (AP) — Clarence Gaston’s two-run single and four innings of shutout relief by Buzz Capra helped the Atlanta Braves beat the 
Texas Rangers 9-5 Saturday afternoon in a Grapefruit League exhibition game. 
Capra came on for starter Phil Niekro with the score knotted at 5-5 and permitted only one hit over the final four frames. Gaston, meanwhile, keyed a three-run uprising in the seventh that broke the tie against Ranger reliefer 
Andy Devine. 
The Braves had jumped Texas starter Berty Blyleven for three runs in the first inning when the first four batters in the lineup stroked hits. Biff Poeoroba nicked Blyleven for a solo home run in the third to make it 5-2. 
The Rangers tied it on five lilts in the fifth, the key blow a two-run single by 
Tom Grieve. But in the Atlanta seventh, an error opened the door for the 
Braves, whose three runs were all unearned.

Of THE EXPRESS NEWS STAff 

There must have been some pretty inconspicuous termites at work between games of Satur­ day’s Trinity and Hardin-Sim­ mons doubleheader. 

In game one. Trinity pounded out nine hits, batted around in a seven-run fourth inning and posted an 8-6 victory. 
Then, there was game two. Those same bats, except for two lineup changes, got just three hits and lost a 
4-o decision. The defeat lowered the TU record to 7-13 for the year. Trinity lost the three-game series to Har- din-Simmons, 2-1. 
The Tigers got a solid performance from pitcher Eddie Weiss (2-6) in the opener. Weiss gave up just one run and four hits in the first five innings. He began to tire, however, and gave way to Jay Moritz iii the seventh inning. 
“ I could tell I was tired because my arni was aching when I warmed up in the fifth,'' Weiss said. ‘But I felt really easy out there. My fastball and curve were going well for me. 
“ I was keeping the ball down and just let one* slip (a homer by Phillip 
Tippen in the fourth) a little.” 
T ro u b le 

Weiss was in trouble in the first in*v mug when two Trinity errors and a sacrifice bunt put runners at second and third with one out. But Weiss struck out Tippen and got Alan Lakatta to ground out to end the threat. 
Trinity took the lead in the third when Ruben L o z a n o walked, moved to second on a balk and scored on Sergio 
Trevino’s double lo center. But Tip­ pet! s homer evened things in the top of the fourth. 
The tie was a short-lived one as 12 
TU batters knocked out six hits and seven runs to flatten Cowboys’ starter 
Larry Martindale (3-2) and reliever 
Doug Huddleston. A second relief pitcher. Don Lawson, finally caged the 
Bengals. 
Mike Gutierrez had a two-run single* and Lozano slammed a two-run double in the enslaught. Rich Squilla and John 
Kaufman also added run-scoring sin­ gles Kaufman, in fact, got two hits in the inning. 
Hardin-Simmons got one back in the sixth . And the Cowboys scored four in the seventh before making an out. This is when Weiss left and Moritz entered. 
Montz walked the first batter, but re- tired the next three to end the game. 
Cowboys’ pitcher Ken McLeod (3-1) was staked to a 2-o lead in the first inning and needed little else in putting down Trinity, He pitched hitless ball through the first three innings until 
Frank Oakes whac ked a two-out single in the fourth

Four Hardin-Simmons hits and an error by TU shortstop Trevino ac­ counted for the* two tallies iii the first inning. Hardin-Simmons got another run in the third off Tiger hurler I).J. 
Webb <(1-2) when Tippen hit a two-run double, driving home Larry Tatum who had walked. 
Trinity’s only real chance in the second game came in the fifth. Hector 
Rodriguez and Paul Phillips both walked and moved up on a wild pitch. 
Following an out, the second of the inning, Oscar Perez walked, loading the bases. But Lozano, who got two quick strikes, grounded to short to end the inning. 
Webb, who struck out four and walked only two, gave up his fourth run in the sixth when Rusty Hamric walked, stole second and scored on an error by second baseman Squilla.

NEW VOUK (A P) - 
Houston’s Cougars arc slight favorites to beat 
St. Bonaventure Sunday for the championship (if the new-look National In­ vitation Tournament — the nation’s oldest post­ season collegiate basket­ ball classic. 
Houston’s hopes, say both Cougar Coach Guy 
Lewis and St. Bonaven­ ture mentor Jim Satalin, could rise or fall on the play of Houston’s Otis 
Birdsong, the tourna­ ment’s leading scorer with 78 points in three games. 
Despite 
Birdsong’s point production. Lewis laments that the 6-foot-4 guard is not playing up to par. Birdsong’s 26-point pcr-game average for tin1 tourney is four shy of his season average. 
Birdsong 

“ lf Birdsong is having a bad tournament and he has a good game against us, then we are in for bad, bad trouble,’’ said 
Satalin. “ He is one super player.” 
The Bonnies appear to be peaking as they move into the NIT final against 
Houston. Satalin’s squad, 
23-6, has won 17 of its last 
2o games. 
“ We’ve played exceop- t ion ally well in getting here,” Satalin said iii as­ sessing St. Bonaven­ ture^ route to the NIT championship show­ down. “ We played our last six games on the road and won five of them. We’re playing the best we have all season.” 
3 
Even if St. Bonnie finds a way to contain B ird ­ song. Satalin's quintet will find that Houston, 
29-7, isn’t strictly a one- man outfit. 
Lewis points to the play of Mike Schultz 
(47 points and a tourney-high 
46 rebounds) and Cecil 
Hose (43 points) as fac­ tors in the three earlier 
Houston victories in the 
NIT 
“ They've come through for us and picked up any slack left bs 
Otis," said Lewis, one of the nation's veteran col­ lege basketball coaches. 
He is looking for career coaching victory No. 4o1 in Sunday's final. 
"It wasn't easy getting here,” said Lewis. “ We started with a one-point w in, had another one- point win and then had to struggle against Alaba­ ma (by six points) in a real exciting semi ” 
Alabama 

Alabama, tin* pre-tour- ney favorite upset by 
Houston in the semifinals 
Thursday night, meets 
Villanova, beaten by St. 
Bonaventure tin* same evening, in Sunday’s consolation final, with game time at Madison 
Square Garden at ll a.m., EST. The cham ­ pionship match follows, starting al about I pm 
Lewis cites 
St, 
Bonaventure players 
Glenn 
Hagen, 
Greg 
Sanders and Essie Hol­ lins as some of the rea­ sons the NIT final “ will be a very hard game.” 
Sanders is the j bunnies' top scorer in the tourney with 64 points while Hagen and Hollins each have contributed 6o points. 
This year marked a format change for the 
NIT. First-round games were played at different sites around the country instead of New York and the eight surviving teams then came into Madison 
Square Garden for the quarter-final, semifinal aud championship games.

NEW YORK (A P) - Houston 
Coach Guy Lewis was discussing college basketball defenses. He qualifies as an expert after 21 years and 4oo victories as bench boss of the Cougars. 

“ I think I ’d rather play against a zone than a tough man to man,” de­ cided Lewis. 
When the conversation turned to St. 
Bonaventure Coach Jim Satalin, so­ meone asked how he’d handle Hous­ ton’s hot shooters in Sunday’s National 
Invitation Tournament championship game. 
“ Man to man,” said Satalin. 
St. Bonaventure, you see, isn t in the 
NIT finale to make things comfortable for Lewis and the Cougars. The 
Bonnies would like that title for themselves, and Satalin thinks his club 

 can take it. 
“ This is the first time we’ve been in the finals in any ournament,” said Sa­ talin. “ It’s a great opportunity ... maybe once in a lifetime.” 
The Bonnies seem to he peaking as they move into the title game against 
Houston. “ We’re playing the best we have all season right now,” Satalin said. “ We’ve won 17 of the last 2o. Our last six games have been on the road and we’ve won five of them.” 
To win the championship, the 
Bonnies will have to find a way to contain Houston's Otis Birdsong, the tournament’s leading scorer with 78 points, and the Cougars’ Mike Schultz, tho top rebounder with 46. 

Schultz, a New York native who never bothered going to the NIT in the days when he was growing up just a short subway ride away, thinks the 
Cougars can handle anything the 

Bonnies throw at them. 
“ I believe we can beat them if we play our game,” he said. “ We have to play our own style and stay with it.” 
That style is built around running. 
“ We run, we move the ball and we play a team game.” said Schultz. “ We can set up too if we have to, but we prefer the running game.” 
The job of controlling Birdsong will go to Jim m y Baron, said Satalin. 
“ Jimmy is a good physical player and 
I think he’ll play Birdsong tough." 
Lewis thinks the whole tournament has been tough for Birdsong, a second team All American. 
“ Otis Birdsong is an All American if 
I ever saw one,” Lewis said. “ But he’d be the first one to tell you that lit* hasn’t had a good tournament.” 
Part of the problem has been tough, physical defenses played throughout the NIT.

RO NALD IBBS 
Hamlet' Director Ibbs guides lead Richard Jones in scene with Tim laughter. 

#M O fO S «V COM M M U 
RICHARD JONES 
Jones as the reflective and morose 
Hamlet' in Ibbs' production of the classic. 

I bbs ponders the thought. 
“ If there s anything to that idea, it m ight be that we try to create an atmosphere that is a help to working creatively. 
“ But look at it another way. I search these people out I want to work with them .’’ 
If Ibbs hadn t been able to find the people he has cast in “ H am let,” he might never have done the show. 
“ I d on’t believe you even think about doing 
‘Ham let’ until you’ve found the right Ham let for the role." 
Ibbs found his Hamlet in Richard .Tones, a ve­ teran of the original Melodrama T heater and San 
Antonio T heater Club and of professional Shake­ speare festivals in NewEngland. Tones and his w ife, 
K aren, w orked w ith Ibbs in “ Shadow and Sub­ stance,” and Jones will be on the IWC faculty next year 
“ If I don’t do 
Hamlet’ now,” Ibbs told himself. I'll lose him .” The decision to stage 
“ H am lett” grew into a possession. Although he had acted in the show Ibbs admits he had never looked at the play beyond his own roles. Now he was ob­ sessed with the dire to do “ H am let” up right. 
On Dec. 23 Maureen Reft ti* visis some friends in 
Brownsville, and Ibbs locked the doors to his home, got as far away from the telephone as possible, and settled down 12 hours a day for seven days with 35 books about “ Ham let,” a model of the set designed by Timothy Laughter, and the play itself. 
When he em erged, Ibbs had his vision of “ H am ­ le t’’ as “ yo u th re b e llin g a g a in st h y p o c risy , dishonesty, infidelity and the lack of tru th and integrity they see in their elders.” 
When the play was announced, there were fast rum ors that Ibbs would play Polonius or perhaps the ghost of H am let’s father. “ It’s w rong for a director to play a part at all. Either the role or the direction suffer.” 
Ibbs is m ore known to the public for his acting. 
He and Halligan worked for years in Dublin and 
London th e a te rs. Ibbs began as a second-line chorus boy bouncing a rubber reach ball in a m usical. He has gone on to work with Sir John 
Guilgud and Sir Tyrone G uthrie, and he was a regular on “ The Saint” television series at the time he agreed to join his wife as a m em ber of the 
IWC faculty in 19Wi 
While he has spent much of his tim e since then acting (in addition to teaching classes), Ibbs con­ fesser to an even greater enjoyment in directing. 
“ It's a strange rew ard,’’ he says. “ You only get isolated m om ents as a director. But when they come to flow er, when they work, i f s so m uch better than the applause you receive as an actor. 

H E K N O W S IT A L L / 
“ I wish I were a better director. The responsi­ bility i-> enormous. And a director needs so many talents.” 
Actors who have worked with Ibbs feel he ha-. those talents “ He knows it all,” one of them says 
“ Working with him in a play is worth any num ber 

The Charming 
Mr. Ibbs 

‘W e try to create an atm o sp h e re that is a help to w o rk in g cre ative ly.' 

 tonio has had to an all-star cast tor a production of 
“ Shadow and Substance.” This week they're doing it again with “ H am let.” in which practically every good perform er in the city not tied down to another theater is taking a part. 
But Ibbs. who is directing “ H am let” for the first time (he has played the title role 25o times in four productions), seem s rather astonished at the sug­ gestion he is some sort of genteel Sol Hurok. 
“ It’s an am azing theory,” Ibbs says. “ I’m sur­ prised myself that people want to work here For 
H amlet’ we have Jeanette Morneau walking on as a court lady One of the best actresses in the city, and she’s doing a walk-on. 
“ Rosencrantz and (iuildenstern are two sm all roles that are usually filled by tail-cnders, what the 
English call your weak a cto rs. But we’ve got Bon 
Davis and Steve Ross, twit of San Antonio’-, best actors, in the roles Yes, I suppose it is true, isn t it?” 

By RON WHITE 
ONE ARTS ED'TO* 

He is a genuine Mr. Nice Guy. Ronald 
Ibbs wouldn’t think about saying an un­ kind word about someone. Why, of course not. That’d be like . . . well, picking one’s nose in front of the Queen. Of course, one wouldn't do it. 
Ronnie Ibbs even looks the part of Mr. Nice Guy. 
Suited: Nothing too flashy, mind you. Light red hair combed back over the ears in a fashion one associates with Shakespearian actors in mid-soli­ loquy. 
He even moves nicely. His hands wave constantly to punctuate conversation. But the movement is graceful and gentle, as though the listener is a gitterish bird easily frightened 

‘H A M L E T N E X T W E E K . 
(.ast year the pattern became more pronounced as the pair brought together the closest San An­ 

P E O P L E A R E C H A R M E D . 
Ibb’s manner has an entrancing effect on visitors. 
He and his wife, M aureen Halligan, are artists- in-residence at Incarn ate Word College. People find themselves charm ed by this man whose most commonplace greeting comes across as heart felt invitation. And som etim es they are infatuated. 
“ Every girl in Ronnie’s dram a classes is in love with him ,” a form er student says. “ All he has to do is to say, ‘My dear’ to them aud they’re swooning." 
O.K., he’s Channing. But is that what one wants w ritten down in th e record books — “ He was charm ing” ? Those won t be the last words on Ibbs. 
More than likely it will be said that Ibbs and 
H alligan are cre a tiv e geniuses; low-keyed but powerful m anipulators of San Antonio theater who have been responsible for the most consistently fine theater the city has seen. 
For years the conventional wishful thinking among folks interested in live theater went so­ mething like this; “ Oh. wouldn’t it be nice if all the good actors in San Antonio could get together at the sam e th e a ter to do one really fine, really spectacular, really beautiful show.” 
While others were thinking it, Ibbs and Halligan have been doing it. A n o ticab le p a tte rn h as emerged in San Antonio. Sooner or later p racti­ cally every local theater person with that spark of true talent winds up working at Incarnate Word 
College. 

D avid A llan Coe: 
A real lo o t stom per

It is not m al tough to

Nearly every tim e he has been in te rv lowed. In* has found an opportunity to th re a te n to sto m p som e p a rt of the re ­ porter's hotly. W hile it may he a m in o rity view, for personal reasons I am generally opposed to reporters helm: stomped. 
I’ rov im : * hat so m e ­ tim es you can't please a n y b o d y , m any o th e r w rite rs n e ve r forgave 
Coe for not m urdering someone. 
A year or so ago. far m ore people than had ever heard Coe's m usic w ere tre ate d lo sto ry after story about him in national publications.

I think he threatened to dti some mon* stom ping.

Classical record review 
Horacio G utierrez: 
Talent vs. slugworm 
Bv DAVID ANTHONY R ICH ELIEU 

Something awful happened to p ia n ic Horacio 
Gutierrez on the way to the recording studio for his record debut — he ran into Andre Previn. 
Previn and the London Sym phony O rchestra team up with this young Cuban-American pianist in what should be a dynam ite offering, but is a disaster. 
One might really ask why a new recording artist would pick two of the m ost-recorded pieces ever to make his debut. The competition is simply over­ whelming when you are trying to muscle into the crowded listings for Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto 
No. I in B-Flat Minor and Liszt’s Concerto No. I in 
E Flat. 
There is no really definitive recording of the 
Tchaikovsky — but the Van Cliburn-Kiril Kondra- shin on RCA would certainly have still to be the best. That recording helped launch Ciliium on the road to fame and for month after month it was the top-selling LF in the United States. 
The secret is the conductor. K ondrashin is a genius. C liburn’s playing happens to be pretty good too. But other recordings like the Richter- 
Karajan on DGG shows the m aturity and brilliance of a real w orld-rank pianist who, in that case, pretty much carries an uninspired conductor along for the ride. 
The definitive recording would be a Richter- 
Kondrashin match-up. But even in the company that is available, G utierrez has to swim upstream in some pretty fast current. 
Surprisingly, the pianist has nothing to apologize for. His playing is excellent throughout E and superb in many sections. He has it, there is no question at all of his abilities and artistry. 
But to G utierrez’s eternal lam ent, Previn also happens to have something to do with this performance. 
Previn’s style is akin to that of a slugworm. He is the only conductor I have ever heard who managed to make Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony sound like a gypsy dance. He did that while conducting the 
San Antonio Symphony. He does worse things to the Tchaikovsky and Liszt on this Angel release 
(S-37177). 
There is no orchestral control at all The horns sound out of tune in the Tchaikovsky finale and the strings have a wavering effect that in worse than some of the interference you pick up on your FM tuner. The orchestra has no bite, no color, just a lot of distracting tempos and interpretations 
To Gutierrez's other misfortune there happens to be a Richter-Kondrashin version of the Liszt that is 
THE recording of this piece (it’s on Philips). 
Compared to the electrifying Russian version, 
Previn manages to transform one of the most exhilarating concert showpieces ever written into a funeral dirge. G utierrez, at tim es, seem s to be trying to pick up the tempo — alm ost as if he is playing one piece and the conductor is leading another in a nightm are not completely unlike the 
( oneerto Populaire at the Hoffnung Music Festival 
(a gem of musical profundity available on Angel), 
I certainly hope Angel gives G utierrez another chance with some more Tchaikovsky — he seem s particularly good at that. The Tchaikovsky second would be a good choice. But they need to get him a new conductor. 
Previn, meanwhile, ought to be relegated back to movie scores where he belongs. 
This disc is worthy of collecting only if you want to have the first recording by a very talen ted pianist who obviously has better tunes ahead — as long as he doesn’t again cross paths with the likes of Andre Prev in.

Thinking Small 

For some people, the smaller the better, lf you enjoy tininees, you'll have a hard time finding things smaller than they come at the City 
Lumber Company. 
In addition to selling lumber, the company also has a selection of hundreds of miniature pieces of furni­ ture for dollhouses. 
The pieces 
— from tubs to cub-, boards to beds to dishes to wallpaper and flooring 
— are all carefully detailed and built to scale. 
Even if you don’t have a dollhouse, the miniatures make in­ teresting items for a what-not shelf.

Cruisin’ Down the River 

 lf the idea of another vacation to the G ran d Canyon this summer gives you the yawns, then how about a boat trip down the 
Am azon? 
A group called the American 
River Touring Association is spon­ soring several river trips, including the Amazon, River Tara in Yugos­ lavia, and even some domestic river journeys. 

The trips are designed for camping enthusiasts, although no prior experience is required. There is no upper age limit, but you should be in good health, the association advises. 
The Amazon trip is a 15-day journey from the headwaters of the river on rubber paddle rafts through the Sacred Valley of the 
Incas. The trip ends at Machu 

Picchu. 
The cost of the trips begins at 
$77o (less air fare). The Amazon trip is $1,o64 (less airfare). You can get details on any of the trips by writing the address below.

JOSEPH GONZALES 
1218 Texas Ave. 
HOLY CROSS HIGH SCHOOL 
Joe Gonzales has received a host of awards at Holy Cross High 
School. He has been elected president of his class two years, is president of the student council, but the one which holds the most importance for him was his election as eucharistic minister by his peers, enabling him to serve communion. 
The son of Gilbert and Consuelo Gonzales is ranked fourth in his class with a 3.51 grade point average. A member of the National Honor 
Society, hi* is a recipient of the Honor monogram and Theology I award. 
He pursues an active interest in drama, now in his fourth year on the speech and debate team. Joe took first place in the 1974 Optimist In­ ternational Zone Oratorical Contest. 
Scouting also occupies a great deal of Joe’s time. He holds the rank of 
Life Scout and has taught the Junior Leader Development Course and served on the staff of Bear Creek summer camp. 
Perhaps Joe’s greatest interests lie in his career goals, music and writing. He hopes to earn degrees in music and English from North Texas 
State University. He lists playing the guitar and studying music as his m<)st pleasurable pastimes, hoping to become an accomplished jazz guitarist. A secondary interest is writing short stories and poetry. 
Currently he plays the guitar and leads the Little Flower Parish combo during Sunday Mass, and also plays in a combo at Holy Cross. He has been involved two years with the Little Flower Church Youth Club. 
He will soon be honored by the Optimist 
Club of San Antonio for his achievements.

 next year. The d iffer­ ences in prices per miles flown now is ridiculous. 
“You can fill a plane from the West Coast to 
Honolulu. So if you only 
HALF fill it Honolulu to 
Tahiti — same distance 
— you must double the price.” 
T riangle fares are becoming a big seller. 
The 
Honolulu agent mapped it on a cocktail napkin: 
“ I hook you from San 
Francisco or Los Angeles to Honolulu. Round-trip. 
Say $3<MI For $4(1 more you can go by way of 

Alaska with a stopover in 
Anchorage. 
“ That’s Western Air. 
Any airline can feed you into the Western system. 
“ Now Western has a new route: Between West 
Coast to Miami. You fly to Miami lf you buy a round trip ticket, you can get some extra milage by retu rn ing via Mexico 
FREE. With stopovers in 
Cancun, 
M erida and 
Mexico, which they will let you have at no extra charge.

 at B rink’s, you could certainly confuse the FBI and spend very little on air fare." 
“We’ve been told of so many low-cost air fares we hardly know w here to start . . .” 
The idea behind these special fares is to FILL 
THAT AIRPLANE! You pay a month or so in advance. (T hat m uch advance money also brings the price down ) 
There are so many of these m u lti-in itial flights, I d go through a travel agent. Not because the airline reservation girl doesn't know 
But the travel agent knows the top-of-the line girl. 
The sharpest girl in the shop. 
He calls her, makes the booking, verifies his figures. (And we hope sends her a Christmas present during the jolly season.) 
“ How many cigarettes can we take into 
Europe?" 
Different rules 
Most countries print it a one carton. However, they rarely push it. "Are you bringing in any cigarettes?” “ Just en­ 

 ough for the week I’m here, Inspector.” 
In French airports, there are two exits. 
Marked “Nothing to De­ clare." ‘‘Something to 
Declare.” Walk out the 
“Nothing" gate. Try to look nonchalant. 
Local cigarettes aren’t as bad as you may imagine. Try some. Sin- tras and Estorils in Por­ tugal are much like ours. 
American cigarettes are sold duty-free on a ir ­ planes Also i i i airports on departure. So if you keep moving, you'll keep supplied. 
“ You’ve m entioned before that the English serve break fast toast cold. We were given hot, 
BUTTERED toast every day at tin* Dorchester.” 
Maybe you’re The Last of the Big-Time Tippers. 
I’ve been assured by 
Englishm en: 
“ We 
P R E F E R our toast cold." (They said it in a voice chill enough to match the toast 
“ Show these ruddy Yanks a thing or two!")

The dus the light and the trained eye 

After shoveling five pounds of fine (lust out of my camera bag it occurred to me that last weekend presented a new kind of light to San Antonio photographers. 
Did you take any pictures during the dust storm? 
Notice the light meter reading? 
At the storm ’s height (about IO a m.) the sky was completely overcast. The sun was completely obscured. But the light reading was only one stop less than on a clear day. 
Hmm. 
With clouds causing the overcast the light would have been down three stops. Interesting. 
Another point about dust storms. While they haze out and obscure distant objects, the vail is dark — not light as it is with pollution or fog 
How about skin tones and gram The lighting is completely flat. Much flatter than with totally overcast skies. Even during a heavy ram, film records more contrast than in a dust storm. 
My film showed an increase in grain comparable to pushing four stops Why? If someone knows for sure please drop me a note and I will pass the information along Dust is new to my experiences. 

THIS LAST VARIABLE, light, is the one photo­ graphers try hardest to control and fail most often to understand 
Placing light under complete control moves a photographer out of the throng of really good camera jockies and places him in the top echelon of the craft. 
In photography , working with lighting is what the game is all about A competent photographer should understand his film, cameras, lenses and de­ velopers. These things are only the tools for recording light. Handling them should become instinctual to a photographer. With practice and a very little effort the mechanics will no longer matter 
The* it is time for real photography. The record­ ing of light. Making this stuff work for you and tell your story rather than the other way around. 
Some master photographers such as Irving Penn of Vogue Magazine fame, go so far in their control of light as to avoid entirely shooting with available light. Penn used to tote around a tent and portable studio. 
Even in the backwoods of New Guinea, Penn shot the natives in his portable studio. This gave him complete and final control of the one overwhelming variable. 
Ansel Adams has built a reputation for balancing two variables, film developer and light, in such a way that the two cancel out. He calls it "zone system ” 

Photo Tips 

W ith Ron 
Jones 

IT IS VERY DIFFICULT but zone system works 
Thousands of Ansel Adams’ students and disciples live by the system. It requires different development for each contrast situation and the placement of three tones (black, white and neutral gray) in a precise relationship on the negative 
This is done with slight changes in development times for each negative. A difficult task with 35 nim film where as many as 36 negatives appear on one roll 
The serious am ateur may not be as deeply committed as Penn or Adams. However, there is something he can do to master lighting without dedicating his life to its control. 
The amateur should study light and recognize what it does to film. He should know the difference between contrasty and flat lighting He should see the difference in light quality during rain, snow, overcast sky, north window or high noon — and, cough, dust 
Make a project of studying lighting. It makes a great excuse for sitting quietly under a tree and sure beats cutting the grass 

TELEVISION IS A GREAT teacher of lighting technique In a few hours you should see at least five different lighting situations 
My wife and I have lost the ability simply to watch television. We comment on and criticize lighting and camera techniques. 
“Did you see that back lit shot9 What do you suppose he used for fill?" 
"Probably a piece of crumpled aluminum foil. 
Hey, look at that lens flair. I wonder when was the last time he cleaned his lens." 
Understanding not the quantity but the quality of light, is the path to previsualizing your finished print. 
Light quality is not something easily measured with a meter. Contrast, color and harshness are difficult to record on any meter an amateur would likely have. 
A trained eye can give outstanding readings for all light quality problems. The training is easy. Just keep your eyes open.

 of acting classes But he’" very quiet about it. 
When you do something he likes, Ronnie’U just say. ‘Yes. That’s nice.” ’ 
One begins to wonder two things: Is Ronald Ibbs always so consistently pleasant, so charming? 
Doesn't he have days when he wants to snarl at the world? And if he is always so gentlemanly, how can he control something so often in need of a gruff voice as a pack of actors? 
"Yes,” he says, "I happen to have a very equi­ table temperament Pm very adaptable and also blessed with genuine patience. I don’t have to work at it. 
"Oh, I can get angry, but I can’t put it on as an act for the benefit of my actors. But I do get angry at laziness, at not caring Luckily that happens so rarely.” 
The only problem lie has had with the production is curing some of the actors ut the idea that they are "acting Shakespeare." 
"Rubbish! There’s no such thing! ” Ibbs says. 
"Shakespeare just wrote characters. You have to get the actors to portray those people with truth, integrity and reality. It must bt1 strong to cope with the grandeur of the verse, but it mustn't be rhe­ torical or declamatory.” Although Ibbs has drawn from th** community for many of the roles, he has cast the two main female roles, Ophelia and Ger­ trude, with IWC students. 
"I’m tempted to do what's best for the show, but 
I have a Responsibility to the students. They need to work in shows with experienced actors. You can’t teach acting in the classroom.” 
Ibbs admits to not liking teaching when he first came to IW C, hut he h a s since come to value his relationships with his students. 
"They teach me, can you believe that? When you’re a professional actor, you develop tech­ niques, a slickness It’s safe, but it lacks a heart and soul. 
"The youngsters here have always pulled me up when I'm slipping in my work They stop me from being phoney I’m much more honest than when I came here." 
He has no doubts about the futures of drama students who really love the art. 
"Those who get their degrees ‘to have something to fall back on aren’t going to make it But those who think of nothing but working in theater will. 
"There can be heartbreak in the early days. I was turned down 2o tim es a day — literally. But I lived on soup and cheese and never questioned that somehow I would make a living in the theater.”

Massacre source for ‘Vendetta’ 

By MALBY MAVERICK 
Jr. 

As m easured by the num ber of people ille­ gally killed in one place at one time, NAAC'P re­ cords confirm that it was done, not to blacks, but to Italian immigrants. 

The massacre is de­ tailed in VENDETTA by 
R ich ard 
G am bino 
(Doubleday; $7.95). 

The s la u g h te r took place on March 14, 1891, in New Orleans through the efforts of a mob led by some of the finest gentlemen of the Cres­ cent City while members of the weaker sex flut­ tered their handkerchiefs in dainty approvals. The ladies were quality folks, not the whores of Bour­ bon Street, but the best 

 of Southern womanhood. 

On the night of Oct. 15 
189o, Police Superm en dent David C. Hennessv began walking home with his friend Bill 
O'Connor. 

Suddenly am bushed, 
H ennessy fell to the ground with a mortal bullet wound. 

“ Who did it to you, 
Dave?" O’Connor asked. 

The claim ed reply: 
“ Dagoes.” 

United States, subject 
Italian-Americans to dis­ crim ination which con­ tinues to the present and close the gates against im m ig ra tio n of the

The 

Committee of Fifty after giving a statement to the press that Italian immi­ g ra n ts w ere 
“ idle, worthless, without honor, truth, pride, religion of any quality that goes to make a good citizen.” 
Then The Committee of Fifty, with no blacks 

 or Italian-Americans on it, issued what was to be a proclamation of death. 
The “ g u ilty ” w ere asked to come forward and confess, for “ to this we intend to put an end, peaceably and lawfully if

“ Ehrlichm an: That s right. 
"Nixon: Of course, the trouble is . . . you can’t find one that’s honest. . “ 

The ju ry could not reach a verdict on three of the defendants, and found six not guilty. It was then that the mob began to form. 
On th e following morning the new papers of New Orleans had ad- 

 his own humble story by recounting, as the book opens, the ord eal of w orking 
58 stra ig h t hours in a h ospital emergency room. 
He somehow managed to make a situation filled with potential dram a as in te re stin g as boiled liver. That comparison may be a disservice to boiled liver 
In je rk y but vague flashbacks, Dr. Horowitz takes us back to his youth in the B ronx, where be liked to tear apart earthw orm s and play Ping Pong. 
He assures us he was never pressured by his middleclass Jewish par­ ents to become a doctor. 
In the sam e breath, however, he recalls his parents calling him “ Dr.

Dr. Horowitz’ credibility. 
In a rush of detail too boring to mention, Hor­ owitz zooms down to

Dr. Horowitz tries to cry, but can’t quite work it up. He wants to, but there’s no time. Besides, as Dr. Horowitz charm ­ ingly puts it. as Anna is being readied for the cooler, he has o th e r emergencies to attend to. 
Dr. Horowitz spends the last third of this book detailing an example of hospital politics only the most depraved Health

She’s a high-kicking Reinking 

NEW YORK — Dancer 
Ann Reinking is said to be the highest kicker on 
Broadway, bot the leggy 
27-year-old, blue-eyed beauty from Seattle and 
San Francisco, says, “ I don’t know. 
“ I ’ve alw ays seen 
Owen Verden kick up to her ear. I saw a man who had very good ’e x te n ­ sion,’ as they call it, kick himself in the face, and knock himself out. 
“ I’ve gotten so I can get close to my nose, but kicking high is not a real criterion ao how good a dancer you are.” 
When Owen V erden decided at 5o to quit dancing for a while, Ann 
Reinking replaced her as 
“ Roxie Hart” in the mu­ sical, “Chicago.” 
Owen p ra c tic a lly handed her the crown of queen of the dancers by saying, “ Ann can kick her legs higher and keep them up longer th an I can.” 
“ dem ured I d o n ’t know about all of that,” 
Ann the other day, “ If 
Owen was w orking I ’d have to work real hard.” 
Anyway, being queen

By EARL WILSON 

 of the Broadway dancers, or only a candidate for it, is no bed of roaes, she soon demonstrated. 
“ I’m injured a g a in ,” ehe admitted. “ I pulled the h am strin g in the back of my thigh. It hurts every time I kick. I can get my leg up there, but it hurts.” 
She waved the injury aside, because it was in­ consequential compared to the time she cracked a vertebra — equivalent to break in g her back — when she was doing a flip with the Andrew Sisters in “ Over Here!” 
She crawled off stage, passed out, and couldn’t 

 bend her back for six weeks. . 
"Being a dancer," she said, “ is being an a th ­ lete. 
“ A prima ballerina can have more injuries than any athlete. A 1o-minute dance is the equivalent of to run ning fast for IO minutes. 
“ You s ta rt g e ttin g 
In ju ries when y o u ’re about 25. You have to warm up more. 
“ Mikhail Baryshnikov says when he was 2o, he never warmed up. Then he did five m in u te s warm-up for each year. 
At 2o he w a rm s up 45 minutes.” 

Ann is becom ing a leadin g lady of the 
B roadw ay th e a te r by playing “ Roxie Hart.” 
“ T his p a rt is a big stre tc h for m e ,” Ann said, "playing somebody who’s a cross betw een 
Lucille Ball and Charlie 
Chaplin. 
“ She’s really a rotten person, but you have to like her. She killed her boyfriend and took ad ­ vantage of the murder by becoming a celebrity.” 
Ann has a face th at’s unique, she says — a lit­ tle nose and big jaw . 
She’s photogenic and sexy looking. Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, observed that about four years ago and cast her in a featured role in “ P ip­ 

 pin,” and she was off. 
“ I love doing Bob 
F o ss e ’s w ork — h e ’s brilliant!” she said. 
“ She gets plenty of op­ portunity in “ Chicago.” 
Ile choreographed new dances for her. 
When (Iwen and Fosse separated after 12 years of marriage, Ann Reink­ ing was soon observed being the Fosse date ar­ ound town. 
Ann had been married oncel to s in g e r L arry 
Small. 
Fosse had been m a r ­ ried to Mary Ann Niles and .loan McCraken, be­ fore Gwen Verden. 
“ Bob loves dancers. He has such respect for the and he is a great dancer himself. 
“ When he put me in 

‘Pippin,’ I blossomed. I was so much better. Bob told Shirley McLaine she was g re a t and she b e ­ came a star.” 
“ Are you and Bob 
Fosse still hav in g a 

 romance? 
“ So far.” 
“ How long?” 
“ F our y e a rs — four- and-a-half.” 
“ And it’s still o n ?” 
“ Yes — what time is It?”

Last y ear you could have becom e an o v er­ night sensation with a song about CBers. 
This year a major film studio hopes the sam e w ill hold tru e about movies. 
P a ram o u n t p lan s to release ’‘Citizens Band” later this year and then start counting the money it will make on it. 
T he m ovie is being bilk'd as “ the first Hol­ lywood feature about the current phenomenon of 
CB radio and its effects on people s lives.” 
W hether it will deliver all that rem ains to be seen. 
Very little information h as a c tu a lly been re ­ leased about what hap­ pens in “Citizens Band.” 
According to Param ount publicists, the company is try in g to keep the story line a secret so no one else will jum p in with the sam e idea. 
P a ra m o u n t w ill say this much. The comedy- d ra m a co n c ern s the 
CBing-type lifestyle of a group of characters in a sm all American town. 
It will revolve around common CBing happen­ in g s, have a sea reh - and-rescue portion and, of course, the inevitable love story.

When Patrick Wayne needs fatherly advice he talks to The Duke 
* 
WITH The Duke, John Wayne, slowly riding off into the sunset, it s comforting there is a six foot four, square-jawed, dead-eye named 
Wayne ready to keep law and order in the westerns. 
With JO movies and two TV series under his belt. Patrick Wayne (above) looks fit for the job, He has an excellent mentor. 
“ I began my film career with Dad and I nev­ er accept a part without discussing it with him first,” said Patrick from the Canary Islands where he is filming The People That Time For­ got 

SAYINGS 
OF THE 
WEEK ... 
• RINGO STARR, former 
Beatle, talking about prob­ lems he has as an actor: 
‘‘Getting a job is the hardest part. Producers don’t trust me as an actor; they think 
I’m some sort of rock and roller. I don't need top of the bill, I just want a job.” 
• JIM WRIGHT, Majority 
Leader of the House of Rep­ resentatives: “I think if the members of this body were to take the vows of poverty, abolish our offices, abandon our homes, and pitch tents on the Capitol lawn, we d still be criticized for something — maybe walking on the grass.” 
• BETTE 
DAVIS, first woman to receive the Ameri­ can 
Film 
Institute’s 
Life 
Achievement Award: 
‘‘The actor who lives his profession and loves his part is a suck­ er. He’ll work for free. Joan 
Crawford and I were paid very little for Whatever Hap­ pened To Baby Jane? Nobody wanted to pay two old broads a lot of money.” 
• ROSAL YNN 
CARTER, commenting on the effect of publicity on her nine-year-old daughter Amy: ‘‘She doesnt 
E ay any attention to the pub- city. She doesn’t read news­ papers; she doesn’t watch the news, and she has learned to ignore reporters.” 

• KEITH RICHARD, gui 
Urn st for the Rolling Stones, commenting on legal prob­ lems in Canada. ‘‘I don’t know how anyone can accuse me of trafficking in drugs. I can’t even pack bag ” even pack my own 

Beaver Cleaver is a banker now 
WHERE is Beaver Cleaver, 15 years later? 
Jerry 
Mathers 
(right), 28, is a bank executive in 
Ijo s Angeles and married to a schoolteacher. 
Brother Wally, Tony Dow. 33, owns a Southern California con­ struction company and does occa­ sional TV work. 
I .eave It To Beaver is one of the most popular sitcoms of all time and still shows around the world. 
Why? Said Tony: “The series looks at an adult world from a kid’s point of view.” Said Jerry: 
“The world is gripped in a fever of nostalgia.” 
®|? Carol Burnett and Dick Van Dyke play 
Harry and Barbara just for the laughs 

BEFORE beginning his new jobs as college professor and 
TV commentator, Henry Kissinger whisked wife Nancy off to Acapulco for a honeymoon re-do. 
The couple shunned crowds most of the visit, but when their host, former Mexican president Miguel Aleman, threw a wing-ding party for 15o assorted Beautiful People at his Continental Hotel, Henry and Nancy stepped out. 

CHERRY RIE SETS 
A WORLD RECORD 

A U S town claims to have baked the world’s largest cherry p ie- weighing in at 646 pounds 

The pie, more than eight feet in diameter, was unveiled in a ceremony at Fairfield, Conn , and cut with a sabre. The town is trying to get the feat recognized by the Guinness Book of World 
Records 

The 
53-year-old former Secretary of 
State looked robust in his newly-acquired golden tan and white 
Mexican wedding shirt. Party guests commented he looked like a Jewish 
Spencer Tracy. 
‘‘I’m catching up on my reading," Dr 
K. said of his second honeymoon. “I ha­ ven’t read anything but state documents the past eight years.” 

IS this a new CBS news team to counter 
ABC’s feuding prima donnas, Harry Rea­ soner and Barbara Walters? 
Not exactly, Dick Van Dyke and Carol 
Burnett teamed up behind a news desk for a skit at the International Radio and 
Television Society’s awards banquet re­ cently in New York City 
In spite of the obvious gags, CBS loyal­ 

 ists Dick and Carol refused to mention 
ABC, Harry, or Barbara during their comedy routine about a married news- casting team. 
Commented syndicated columnist Earl 
Wilson: ‘‘It was a funny skit, blk you couldn't tell if they were making fun of 
Walters and Reasoner or not. I guess tiiat was left up to your imagination. 

Camera’s click worth $5o,ooo 
SEVERAL top photographers failed to produce the right promo­ tion photo for A Star Is Bom. 
Then Cosmopolitan cover photog­ rapher Francesco Scavullo got his chance to click. 
The result was the photo above, which earned Scavullo $5o,ooo and has become the hit movie’s trade­ mark. How was it done? He stripped Barbra Streisand and 
Kris Kristofferson to the waist. 
‘‘They were joking and ribbing each other for the whole half-day session,” Scavullo said. “I took a whole lot of photographs. This captured the effect we wanted 
The secret was patience ” 

AH, the trials and tribulations of a fairy princess. Take 2o-year-old Princess Caro­ line of Monaco, who is sick of being fol­ lowed by photographers and refuses to smile for the cameras. 
In photo above, even the antics of mom, 
Princess Grace, and dad. Prince Rainier 
— plus the family’s poodle — couldn't help. 
Caroline still put on her worst face for shutter bugs during the family’s skiing hoi- 

Can’t anyone get Princess Caroline to smile? iday, producing the sourpuss photo at iday, producing the sourpuss photo right. Caroline frequently complains about photographers. “They are always trying to catch me in a bikini,’’ she moaned. 
“ I really don't go to a lot of parties, it only seems that way because so many pho­ tographs are taken when I do. Then they show up in magazines for months.’’ 

Peter Sellers’ in-law outraged 
SURE Peter Sellers is a funny co­ median, but would you want your daughter to marry nim? Mrs. Iris 
Frederick was faced with that problem and came up with an an­ swer; No. 
Iris’ daughter, Lynn, 22, and 
Sellers, SI, (above) married any­ way in a civil ceremony in Paris. 
At which point Iris, a London casting director, said: 
“ I will never talk to him There is an age difference 
But more important, there is Mr. Sellers’ track record He has three failed marriages behind him 
(Anne 
Hayes, 
Britt 
Ekland, 
Miranda 
Quarry). Three women can’t be that wrong ” 

Coal miner union mad at Loretta 
COUNTRY singer Lor­ etta Lynn’s autobiogra­ phy is titled, I Was A 
Coal Miner’s Daughter. 
Now the United Mine 
Workers are talking about boycotting Loret­ ta, 39, for “betraying her heritage.” 
It seems Loretta does 
TV commercials (photo at left) for Amax, a chemical company that recently bought into mining. 
“ Loretta has been hurt personally,” said her manager 
David 
Skeptner. “ But she still sings to packed houses, even in coal mining dis­ tricts.” 

Band master spites hits eleven ways 

THERE are ll instruments in 
Sgt. Pepperoni’s band but he doesn’t have to split his fee with anyone—he plays them all him­ self. 
Sgt. Pepperoni is the stage name of Paul Cole, 39, a one-man band from Boston, Mass. 
“ I play Sgt. Pepperoni for a liv­ ing,” Cole told THE STAR “ I ve been doing the act for four years and I manage to get bread on the table for my family of six.” 
Cole makes about $15o for each performance. 
He plays at colleges, pubs and on the streets of Boston, banging and puffing his way through such old favorites as When The Saints 
Go Marching In. 
Among the instruments Cole plays are the trumpet, kazoo, tambourine, bass drum, accordi­ on and banjo. 
With so many pieces of musical equipment strapped to his frame. ifs often difficult to see his cloth­ ing. 
But at one recent concert he wore a red shirt and black pants with yellow stripes down the sides. 
Cole’s performances consist of more than music, though; Limer­ icks are among the show stop­ pers. 
And some of them are so funny that members of the audience will often respond with limericks of their own. 
They've found that a little pep­ peroni can sure spice up an eve­ ning. 

Iris Frederick refuses to speak to her new son-in-law, Peter Sellers. 

TV villain can’t shake his image 
ACTOR William Smith was just too convincingly evil as Falconets in TV’s Rich Man, Poor Man. 
Last season he earned viewer’s loathing by murdering Nick Nolte. 
This season he pursued Peter 
Strauss until the two killed each other in the last episode 
As a result, Smith has had bot­ tles thrown at him and receives strange hate mail. “ Some people can’t understand that what hap­ pens on TV isn t real,” Smith, 44, said 
A paper-villtan, Smith was once a linguist with the National Secu­ rity Agency and speaks five lan­ guages 

New drug fights killer blood dots 

DEADLY blood clots—which kill thousands of Americans every year—could be sharply reduced with a new drug now widely used in Europe, says the American 
Heart Association. 
The AHA said the drug called heparin, could also help women on birth control pills, who run an abnormally high risk of blood clots. 
Heparin is a carbohydrate ex­ tracted from the livers of Lags and other animals. While it is on the U S. market, it is not widely used by doctors here. 
But 
European doctors have been using it successfully for years to prevent clots, especially lung clots resulting from surgery, 
[according to the AHA. 
Lung clots, which originate in the deep veins of the legs, are a frequent complication of surgery. 
In a British study, only two of 
53 autopsied patients treated with heparin died of lung clots while 16 of 72 who did not get heparin had lung clots. 
Women taking birth control pills are blood clot risks because the pills reduce anti-clotting agents in their blood Studies have shawm, they could be helped with heparin, said the AHA.

Kick that saccharin habit 
-and stay sweet and slim 

 hips, orange peel, peach and red clover. 
Herbal teas are free of tannin and caffein, but full of vitamins and miner- 

By CHRISTINA KIRK 
CALOR IE-conscious 
Americans have about 6o days to find a substi­ tute for saccharin, the artificial sweetener the government has de­ creed must be removed from all food and drink. 
With no other artificial sweetener on the market, no-calorie soft drinks, arti­ ficially sweetened foods, and sugar sub­ stitutes used in coffee and tea will dis­ appear from grocers’ shelves once the saccharin ban goes into effect by late 
July. 
So what can the conscientious dieter do to put a bit of sweetness into his or her lite? 
Lois L. Lmdauer, international direc­ tor of the Diet Workshop's weight con­ trol groups, and her nutritional consul­ tant, Dr Morton L. Glenn, give this ad­ vice to dieters: 
1. Be cool but be realistic and plan ahead. 
2. Take advantage of the period until the ban takes affect to train your taste- buds to require less sweetener lf you have been using three packs of sweete­ ner in your coffee, begin today to cut back. There is nothing else a dieter can put in his coffee that is not high in calories. 
3. Begin now to invent new diet drinks for yourself. Experiment with club soda and fruit juice or iced tea with a wedge of orange rather than lemon. 
4. Another diet luxury — artifically sweetened desserts — will go. In their place, have ready a recipe for unfla vored gelatin made sweet by adding fruit juice and fruit. 
5. When the need for a sweet becomes overwhelming, go bananas’ The banana is one of the sweetest fruits and all good diets permit them. We allow you three a week. Pineapple is another possibility. 
The only good thing about this ban is that it will fall in the summer when fruits are in season and naturally sweet. 
Elaine Rose-Ruderman, of the Cor­ nell Co-operative Extension Service, recommended the ultimate solution: “ i think people should learn to do without sweeteners. We had to during World 
War ll when we had a sugar shortage. ” 
She suggested that one way around the problem of drinks is to substitute fruit juice for sugar 
“Mix a half glass of iced tea with a half glass of apple or pineapple juice It gives a delicious tang like the tang in soda.” 
“What’s more, iced tea has no calor ies, and a half glass of juice with per­ haps a wedge of orange is about 65 ca­ lories. It’s not rock bottom, but it gives nutrition, which diet soda does not.” 

EXPERTS TELL HOW 
TO BEAT BAN ON 
LOW-CAL FOODS 

Mrs. Rose-Ruderman noted that some vegetables also provide sweetness — sweet potatoes, winter squash, carrots and yellow vegetables. They provide good nutrition at about IOO calories 
She recommends against turning to honey, com syrup or maple syrup to sweeten foods because “they are all high in calories and not at all good for the teeth.” 
But William Dufty, the author (rf Sug ar Blues and an outspoken opponent of both sugar and artificial sweetners, be lieves there is a place for honey and molasses in the diet. 
“Tile goal should be to get to the point where you can appreciate the nat­ ural taste of foods,” he told THE STAR. 
“But in getting there, many people go through a honey phase. 
“For one thing, it is impossible to gorge on honey or molasses, so it is easy to taper off.” 
He warned, however, that diabetics and pre-diabetics should not eat honey, molasses, or even dried fruits which have a heavy concentration of natural sugars. 
Here are some additional tips from the food experts on how to kick the sac­ charin habit while still satisfying your taste buds: 
TEA: lf you think you don’t like tea, it may be because you have always used tea bags. Dirfty recommends trying some fresh Chinese tea or Japa­ nese bancha tea—either leaf or twig. 
You roast bancha tea lightly in a pan and brew it in a Pyrex pot on the stove for 15 to 2o minutes. Make a huge pot and reheat it when you want it. 
HERBAL TEAS: There are many herbal teas to choose from. Some of the most popular are alfalfa, camomile, sassafras, spearmint, peppermint, rese­ 

 als. 
According to Marceline A. Newton, author of The New Life Cookbook, they make a delicious beverage when you add a squeeze of lemon or a bit of hon­ ey. 
ICE CREAM: Try ice cream made with honey only, says Dufty. It is avail­ able almost everywhere in the country, but be careful not to buy the kind with sugar and honey. 
Gradually wean yourself off the ice cream habit by cutting the amount in half. Save honey ice cream as a reward or for special occasions. 
HOMEMADE DESSERTS: 
In any recipe that calls for sugar or an artifi­ cial sweetener, you can use date sugar. 
It comes in pellet form and is made from ground elates and has all the nutri­ tion of dates. 
Carob, which is rich in minerals and has no fat, is a tasty substitute for cho­ colate when used in a recipe 
FRUITS: Fruit that has been sun­ dried without chemical preservatives has a spectacular flavor and can be used in many dessert combinations. 
“Start with dried apples, raisins, and a little lemon peel,” says Dufty. “Soak a handful of dried apples in cool water. 
If they absorb all the water, add more. 
Chop the raisins with a knife, so that their sweetness is let loose through the whole compote. Add dried lemon peel and simmer. 
“Let the mixture bubble for some 2o minutes, then turn off the heat and let the pot stand. Use the concoction as it is; or put it through the blender .” 
FRESH FRUIT: When you find good fresh fruit in season, eat it that way and savor the flavor. lf you think you can’t enjoy strawber­ ries without sugar or a sweetener, Duf­ fy suggests: 
“Wash the strawberries, leaving the stems on; add a teaspoon of sea salt to a pint of cold water; leave the straw­ berries in the cold salt water mixture for half an hour or so. Now taste."

3 talented sisters hit the big time as writers 
THREE sisters are making big names for themselves in the book business. So much so that they have been dubbed “the Black 
Brontes." 
Their names are Flo, Joy and 
Faye Kennedy and they’ve just had three books published almost simultaneously. The eldest and best known, Flo Kennedy, 61, is a fiery lawyer and TV personality who likes to wear stetsons while campaigning for minority groups such as beaten wives, prostitutes, drug-takers and blacks. 
The cover of her autobiography, 
Color 
Me 
Flo 
(Prentice-Hall, 
$4.95) features her covered in slo­ gans and wearing a stetson. 
Her vivacious sister Joy, 25 years younger, has just liad her book published by Jackie Kenne­ dy’s company. Viking. 
It’s called The Neurotic Wom­ an’s Guide To Non-Fulfillment 
(How Not To Get A Man), and is a compilation of the things she did wrong when trying to find a hus­ band. 
Joy’s reason for writing the book, she says, was money. “I was living in a $lOO-a-month apartment in Harlem, and fight­ ing with the landlord. One day I wrote all over the wall ‘$1o,ooo by 
Christmas.’ 
“By Christmas I had the mon­ ey. I wrote and sold my book.” 
She had more than that. She tiad a $1oo,ooo house with an in­ door pool in a wooded section of suburban New Jersey, which she part owns with Flo. 
“I concentrate on thinking my way to whatever I want," said 
Joy. “A Rolls-Royce is next." 
The third sister, Faye, a parole officer, was inspired to write her book Good-bye Diane (Berkley, 
$1.5o) by a murder a few blocks from her large apartment in Man­ hattan—the same murder that inspired the hit novel Looking For 
Mr. Goodbar. 
She and her husband, who works for a drug abuse center, al­ so have a 52-acre farm in upstate 
New York. 
The three sisters (and two non­ writing sisters, Lynn and Grace) were daughters of a Pullman porter in Kansas City who saw to it that his kids got a good educa­ tion. 
Now the three writing sisters are working on their next books. 
Joy’s is appropriately titled The 
Other Kennedys. Ifs all about her family.

By WAYNE DARWEN 
AN ELITE new club has been formed in Hollywood — the television million­ aires. 
They are the superstar actors and ac­ tresses who make more money doing one 
TV show than many Americans earn in IO years. 
They’re headed by the four super-earn­ ers Peter Falk, Rock Hudson. Dennis 
Weaver and Carroll O’Connor. 
But behind them come 16 other big names whose salaries from TV have either passed the $1 million-a-year mark or are close to it. 
Their popularity with viewers is so great that they can hold studios to ransom by demanding higher and higher salaries or refusing, at the last moment, to renew their contracts. 
A top Hollywood accountant, who st cializes in negotiating salaries for stars, told THE STAR: “They can now earn as much as big-screen movie actors like Robert Redford or Steve McQueen 
“Television payments are following the same path as those for theatrical films — they’re going sky high.” 
Peter Falk, the shabbily-dressed, but sharp-minded Detective Columbo, has the best (teal in the business He gets $2 mil­ lion for four 9o-minute episodes-a-year. 
That is $5oo,ooo an episode. 
The second of the super-earners is veter­ an Rock Hudson. He gets $265,ooo for each of the six McMillan stories he stars in each year. 
Then there’s Dennis Weaver, the $15o,- 
ooo-a-time star of McCloud. There are also only six of those a year. 
Bi! it’s Carroll O’Connor, star of All In 
The Family, who is the king of the super- eamers. He gets more than Falk, Hudson or Weaver But he works a lot longer. 
He has to appear in 22 episodes of the top-rated comedy series show. That’s an annual million. 
And chrome-domed Telly Salvalas gets 
$15~million-a-year starring in about 22 epi- 

- at $11o,ooo a income of $2.42

HOW TO KEEP FROM GETTING BORED 
EVERYBODY gets bored but nobody has to stay that way, a leading psychiatrist said this week. 
“Boredom has almost become an American way of life but you can beat it with some simple but little-used advice," Dr. Harry 
Panjwani told THE STAR, 
Dr. Panjwani, who practices in 
New Jersey, said while you can’t always change boring circum­ stances — such as your job or doing housework — it helps to change your attitude toward them. “Get a new perspective," 

Dr. Panjwani said. “Try to be more optimistic. Look on the good side of bad happenings. 
“If you are a housewife and your husband comes home late, and the dinner is ice-cold, be posi­ tive. You and he can now be alone together, with the kids sleeping. It can be a special time for you.” 
Dr. Paniwani said these other tips can also help beat boredom: 
• Watch less TV Too much of the tube feeds boredom and rest­ lessness. Set aside evenings away from the TV to go to a movie, play tennis or be with friends. 

• Take a break from your rou­ tine. Hire a babysitter, for exam­ ple, and go to lunch with friends or shopping for bargains. Go old to dinner with your husband. 
• Keep in touch with friends and relatives. Everybody needs human contact. Invite a neighbor for coffee. Or phone a friend you haven’t recently heard from. 
At work, find friends among co­ workers and give yourself breaks to chat with them Or invite them to your home for dinner. 

• If you enjoy reading, read 

 more. You’ll find new attitudes and new possibilities for your life. 
• Where possible, change your routine. Do your Thursday chores 
(XI Wednesday and vice versa. 
And while you’re busy at your tasks, listen to music. 
• Give yourself a “private hour” each day to do only what you want — read, re^lo your hair, polish your nails, or just sit quiet ly and think. 
• Try to see the funny side* of your Ute. Laughter is the best ton- 
•ic for boredom The more you laugh, the less bored you'll be. 

 cause she owns the company that produced it and other hits, her real earnings were considerably higher. 
Other stars of weekly series in the 
$45,ooo-a-show bracket include Robert 
Blake of Baretta and Redd Foxx of San­ ford And Son. 
Jack Lord, of Hawaii Five-O, makes 
$35,ooo a show But because he also owns the company which produces the weekly series, his annual income is in the millions. 
On top of their salaries, many stars make huge sums from commercials. 
Robert Blake was paid $36o,ooo for plug­ ging STP motor oil. The commercial was less than a morning’s work. 
Peter Falk broke new barriers with his 
$2 million deal with NBC. He is now the most expensive TV star in the world. 
Falk refused a $3oo,ooo offer to continue as Columbo, and was quite content to sit back and concentrate on his first love — feature movies. 
But the offer was subsequently increased to $5oo,ooo an episode, and was too tempt­ ing for him to knock back. “It happens every year.’’ said one NBG executive. 
“Peter says he is leaving, and we offer him half of California, and he comes back.” 
Columbo — which not only has the high­ est paid star in Peter Falk, but the high­ est production budget — actually loses money for NBG 
The show’s losses on each episode come to about $5oo,ooo. Production costs total about $1.2 million. The advertising return is between $6oo,ooo and $8oo,ooo 
The network screens the show, despite tile losses, simply because it is a prestige product. It also increases viewers — and advertising revenues — for the shows that proceed it. 
Carroll O’Connor used a similar ploy to 
Falk. He threatened to quit All in The 
Family until his weekly salary was boost­ ed to $11o,ooo It was. 
Most of the super-earners receive no residuals and no percentage of the show’s profit. 
But others with less impressive pay packets can push themselves over the million-mark if their series rate well and they have a percentage agreement in their contracts. 
THE STAR’S survey did not include hosts of variety or talk shows. 
Rudolph 
Altobelli, personal manager for Valerie Harper — 
TV’s Rhoda — said: “Actors or actresses are worth whatever they can create for themselves. 
You can't put a price on talent.” 
But of this year’s top money makers, only two will definitely not be making another series of their current shows. 
Mary Tyler Moore will make a greater profit from syndication of her half hour comedy, while Foxx will be making an extra third of his current salary by abandoning 
Sanford And Son to do his own half-hour show The new show will be made by his own produc­ tion company. 
Those with question marks over their immediate futures are Rock 
Hudson and Bob Newhart 
On the day Hudson was to have told producers if he would appear in McMillan for another year, he embarked on a boat cruise. 
But he is expected to agree to continue, for a considerable in­ crease on his current $265,ooo. 
Comedian Bob Newhart does not want another year of his half-hour comedy series. But he is obliged under his contract with 
Mary Tyler Moore Enterprises.

AMERICA’S energy’ of the future will come from the stars, the sun, the sea and the earth’s core. 
That's the opinion of IO leading psychics who studied the energy crisis for THE STAR 
The good news is that the crisis will be solved. America will not decline or be forced to a standstill because of lack of energy. 
But the bad news is that the so­ lutions will take time and sacri­ fices will be necessary. 
There also will be national and international scandals even big­ ger than Watergate as disclosures of selfish elements exploiting the energy crunch come to light. 
These developments will dis­ hearten and anger people. But 
Americans will put such feelings behind them and concentrate their will and ingenuity on finding ways to meet the energy demand. 
Some solutions will be scientific and some will be social, involving new lifestyles and a massive re­ distribution of population. 
But, taken together, they will work. The energy problem — like many other problems of the past 
— will be surmounted. Here are the psychics’ predictions:

Within the next five years, the government will sponsor enor­ mous solar energy plants through­ out the nation. 
Ocean tides will also be suc­ cessfully utilized, as will nuclear energy’ when ways are developed to render the waste material harmless. 
Future automobiles will be pow­ ered by pollution-free solar or nu­ clear batteries. The atomic unit will be available within five years and will also be used for a vast monorail system to reduce the million of cars on our highways. 

Scientists will consider tapping the cosmic magnetism which emanates from the stars and is the energy which causes the earth and moon to revolve. Our space­ ships operate under this principle. 
We will have a breakthrough, starting a new era in energy sources through magnetism.

The predicted power sources are not so weird, say scientists 

SOME of the energy solutions pre­ dicted by THE STAR’S panel of psychics may sound far-fetched. 
They’re not. 
Phil Keif, spokesman for the 
U.S. Energy Research and Devel­ opment Administration (ERDA) said scientists arc already work­ ing on versions of ut least nine of the predictions. 
Here’s where the psychics say the energy of the future will come from: 
SOLAR 
ENERGY 
# 
A THOUSAND U S. buildings al­ ready have solar heating and cooling systems Many more are expected by the year 2ooo ERDA is studying an electric power sta­ tion that would drive turbines. 

ELECTRIC 
CARS 

SOME vehicles are on the market now, but problems with cost, range and speed, persist 
Con­ gress has authorized $16o million for research. Electric cars would be used mainly by urban commut­ ers. 
EA RTH S 
ENERGY 

MANY scientists believe the earth's core consists of molten nickel and other metals The U .S. 
Project Mole, aimed at drilling deeper into the earth than ever before, was abandoned several years ago 
But 
The Geysers, 

 where volcanic action is close to the surface, provides half the electricity for San Francisco. 
SEA 
ENERGY 
CONTROLLED fusion research­ ers are getting heavy water —- water molecules with extra hy­ drogen atoms — for their experi­ ments from sea water. But practi­ cal fusion generators aren't likely until the 21st century. French scientists are working on generat­ ing electricity from the extreme tides of the Bay of Biscay. 
SHALE 
THIS oil-rich rock is abundant in 
Colorado, but there are such prob­ lems as how to dispose of waste shale and the great amount of precious Western water required to process shale.r 

OIL 
WELLS 

THE Chinese have announced dis­ coveries of new oil but the U.S. doesn't know how much was found Meanwhile, exploration for new oil continues, often unsuc cessfully, in the rest of the world. 
U.S. firms are using manmade chemicals, called polymers, to extract mere oil from existing wells. 
LASER POWER 
CALIFORNIA researchers are us­ ing a $25 million super-laser in ex­ 

 periments with controlled fusion

AN experimental windmill for producing electricity at NASA’s 
Lewis Research Center in Ohio may be the forerunner of thou­ sands more that would help pro­ duce the nation s electricity. 

MICROW AVES 

THE Soviet Union is trying to transmit electricity via these ra­ dio signals. They are developing ideas of Nicola Tesla, whose methods carry electricity to re­ mote areas of western Canada.

THE only new energy that can be effectively harnessed in a very short time is solar energy. The government will make a massive effort to turn out an efficient, low cost solar energy cell in the shor­ test period of time. 
Many millions will be spent and within five years solar energy will be widely available at a price everyone can afford. It will end most of our dependence on for­ eign oil. 
Canada will discover huge new oil fields but will be eclipsed by 
China, whose findings of oil depos­ its will easily eclipse the Arabian fields

SOLVING the energy crisis is a long term matter. Between 1984 and 1994, a system will be devel­ oped to exploit the heat at the center of the earth. 
For years to come, oil shor­ tages will continue to be political, with problems in Alaska and Aba­ dan Violence in Mideast coun tries will add to the shortage 
July of 1977 will bring further problems and whatever oil we get as an aftermath will have strings attached 
We will learn of the criminal element involved in oil, and that shortages have been caused by 

 misplacing our trust in OPEC leaders. 
President Carter will speak out against the internation­ al dishonesty of oil-producing na­ tions. 
The year 1979 will mark a cru­ cial point for world energy.

RATIONING of natural gas and oil will become a way of life with­ in the next two years in the 
United States. 
Manufacturing plants will be re­ stricted to a set number of hours they can use available power, as we recently saw happen in the

THE current energy problems are a ploy by which the power trust, by using fear and scare tactics, get a higher price for their prod­ ucts. We have been, and are being, sold a bill of goods on gas. oil, the works. Note — as soon as the price of gasoline was raised, there was enough to go around! 
Solar energy will be the up and coming thing, with public and pri­ vate projects representing invest ments in the multimillion dollar level. Many private home owners will go into it, propelled by the same fear that made them invest in bomb shelters. 
By April of this year, we will see changes start in an attempt to ease the situation We will learn the sea can furnish a source of en- ergy we haven’t fully understood or developed 
Major break throughs are coming.

Among them will be sustaining electrostatic units. We will try for a cheaper solar energy unit. Re­ strictions will be lifted on the ex­ ploration of oil and shale deposits and on the amount of oil that can be taken from existing wells. 
The government will also assist financially in drilling new wells and absorbing part of the loss when drillers nit a dry hole.

Margaret Trudeau: Why 
I’m leaving my husband to work in New York 

Margaret and Pierre Trudeau with their third child, Michel: She wants to leave the spotlight. 

By ADAM EDWARDS 

Photographer 
Margaret: 
She wants to be a photo-journalist. 

Mick 
Jagger: 
Margaret scotched rumors of a romance. marriage to Pierre Trudeau. But 
I didn't prepare myself for mar­ riage to the Prime Minister.’’ 
Husband Pierre Trudeau is still protecting his wife and has so far offered no criticism for her re­ cent unusual behavior. 
“ I don’t expect her to stop going to rock concerts or visiting 
Friends in New York.” he said, “u other people judge it wrong, well, that's too bad. 
“So a lady goes to a rock con­ cert and then she goes to New 
York to see a ballet, visit friends and do some photography. I don’t think she can be faulted for disap­ pointing the Canadian people.” 
But he admitted that his wife had cancelled a few of her official engagements And in New York 
Mrs. Trudeau hinted that she may not be returning to Canada for some time. 
Manv of her problems have come from the pressures of being thrown into the world of power politics. 
She has always claimed to be a flower child more than an ambi­ tious wife of a Prime Minister. 
“It was difficult going through the tremendous metamorphosis from a flower child to the Prime 
Minister’s lady,” she said once. 
“I started building things up in­ side which came out in such an­ ger and hostility and fury that it became a bloody revolution of my mind. 
‘‘I feel that I’ve had tremendous growing opportunities in the last six years that perhaps a lot of my peers haven’t. 
’’The only thing that has caused me not regrets but concern is that at 22 I was not a finished, com­ plete person. I was still growing and I nope I’ll still be growing for many years to come ” 

MARGARET TRUDEAU, Canada’s controver­ sial first lady, this week revealed why she is leaving her husband, bowing out of public life and moving to New York. 
“I have resigned as the Prime Minister’s wife be­ cause I’m a human being,” the attractive 28-year- old said. 
“People try to put me in a position of power. I am not interested in that because I am my own person. 
“ People think of me as a weirdo, a wacko and an eccentric. I am none of these things. I just do not want fame, fortune or power.” 
Mrs. Trudeau was romantically linked to Rolling 
Stone Mick Jagger after her mystery trip to New 
York to be with the British rock group. 
She scotched all the rumors of an affair with Jag­ ger, but she was adamant that she was leaving her public role as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau and moving to New York. 
“I have had six years of being a spectator as the 
Prime Minister’s wife,” she said. “Although there is no bitterness or anger on my part, it is time for 
.. id I ............................ 
Prime Minister. me to resign so I have stopped being the wife of a 

“ I am a 28-year-old woman, an independent wom­ an, that believes in people being themselves and my husband supports me,” she said. 
Since she has been in New York. Mrs. Trudeau has spent much of her time at the studio of top pho­ tographer Richard Avedon. 
She has always been a photographic enthusiast and now she wants to become a professional photo­ journalist 
She has been apartment-hunting in Manhattan and plans to spend her weekdays in New York and commute to Ottawa each weekend 
“I am going to be a working commuter,” she said “ My husband is doing fine work as Prime 
Minister. I just want to do good work myself day to day. I cannot plan for the future.“ 
Mrs. Trudeau has in the past frequently com­ plained of simply being “a rose in her husband’s la­ pel .” And there have teen constant rumors that she has been on the verge of a break-up with her 
57-year-old husband. 
Her eccentric public behavior has been a source of rifts between her husband and the Canadian pub­ lic. 
Last year she spent 25 minutes on a talk-back radio show defend­ ing her activities while touring 
South America. She broke proto­ col several times during the 
11-day journey, to the embarrass­ ment of accompanying officials 
Her husband’s political oppo­ nents hinted that Mrs. Truoeau was suffering from mental prob­ lems that put her in a hospital in 
1974, but she hit back at her crit­ ics on the radio show 
“People say I’m a Peter Pan,” she said “They tell me I should grow up Well, I think that is a mistake that people make I don’t think you have to. 
“My actions have given people a spoonful of courage to develop their own personalities. 
“ My mission is to tell people how to live and I will do it any way I can.” 
More recently she broke White 
House protocol when she wore a short dress to a State dinner with 
President Carter. 

Margaret Trudeau (left) strolls down New York’s Fifth Avenue with Yasmin Kahn, daughter of Rita Hayworth: “My actions have given people a spoonful of courage.” 
‘ People think of me as a weirdo—I just do not want fame or fortune9 

“I didn’t think about wearing a short dress or wearing a long dress,” she said later. “I was thinking about going to the White 
House, which I was thrilled about, and wearing something that’s very meaningful 
“The dress was made for me as part of my trousseau and I have worn it once before I wanted to wear something white and I want­ ed to wear something that had meaning for me ” 
Canadians were further out­ raged by reports that she stayed in the same Toronto hotel as the 
Rolling Stones only 24 hours be­ fore 
Stones guitarist 
Keith 
Richard was to appear in court on drug charges. 
Then soon after Mick Jagger and guitarist Ron Wood left Cana­ 

 da for New York, Mrs Trudeau followed 
Rolling Stones manager Peter 
Rudge denied any romance and said that the first lady was more of a nuisance than a welcome guest 
“We even telephoned Canada to try and get her sent home,” he said. 
Mrs. Trudeau, the daughter of a former Canadian Cabinet Minister, has constantly assured the public that her marriage to the Prime 
Minister is as strong as over. 
BU she said this week: “Just because I am married does not mean I cannot talk to other men. 
I am my own person and will not be judged by the press and the people win) read the papers. 

“ I am a free spirit that does not seem to be allowed to survive in a free world. I am not Mrs Prime 
Minister, I am Mrs. Margaret 
Trudeau." 
She admitted that she and her husband are very different people who are not necessarily compati­ ble: 
“He’s a very disciplined, ration­ al kind of person. He works very strongly He and I are really op­ posites because i’m spontaneous and impulsive. 
“He’s very reasoned and thoughtful. But I don't in all cases agree that thought leads to the best action.” 
Mrs. Trudeau, who has three sons aged five, three and one, added: “ I prepared myself for

A DAY in the life of America s First 
Family begins with an early morning telephone call. 
‘Good morning, Mr. President,” says a male aide. ‘‘It is 6:3o a m , sir.” 
Jimmy Carter thanks the caller and slips quietly from the double bed and out of the darkened room. 
His wife, Rosalynn, is awakened by the call, but she dozes fitfully for another half hour or so before rising. 
The sun is beginning to flood the mas­ ter bedroom which Rosalynn has redone in bright yellow walls, draperies and rugs with touches of white. 
Down the hall on the second floor of the White House, daughter Amy, 9, sleeps in the pink and white bedroom last used by Tricia Nixon. 
On the third floor of the private family quarters, two Carter sons and their wives sleep undisturbed until the new Carter grandson, James Earl IV, demands his first feeding. For the President, however, another tightly-scheduled 18-hour day has begun. 
Like his predecessors, Jimmy 
Carter labors long and hard at the nation's business But to a greater degree than any in recent memo­ ry, he makes a determined effort to stay close to his family and in­ volve them in his daily life. 
Mr. 
Carter has designed a 
55-hour work week for himself which allows him the time he needs for study, rest and family affairs 
Having nearly all of his imme diate family under one roof for the first time in years has made it easier for him to achieve the to­ getherness he values and other 
Americans might envy. Here, in hour-by-hour detail, is how the 
Carter family goes about making a home out of the White House. 
The President sips a glass of or­ ange juice as he dresses, and is usually in his office before 7 a rn. 
He may come in as early as 6 a rn. if he has a state dinner scheduled that will subtract from his evening reading time. 
On his desk every morning is a neatly typed schedule of the day’s agenda There are few surprises in it. 
Mr. Carter’s appointments sec­ retary, Tim 
Kraft said: 
“ He wants things planned thoroughly. 

‘He wants things to go as planned. He doesn’t like surprises’ 

 third floors of the President catches up on the day’s news. 

 and he wants things to go as they’ve been planned. He doesn’t like surprises.” 
The daily agenda is drafted two weeks in advance, and while there is necessarily some flexibility, almost every single minute is filled 
The schedule is roughly five 
1o-hour days and a five-nour day on Saturday. The President keeps 
Sunday free to attend church with his family and get a bit of recrea­ tion. 
Mr. Carter prefers to work in a small study adjacent to the Oval 
Office on the first floor of the 
White House He retreats there between appointments with visi­ tors to read the 4o to 5o memoran­ dums he gets every day. 
At 8:3o a m , Zbigniew Breze- zinski, his national security af­ fairs adviser, arrives to give Mr. 
Carter a 15-minute intelligence briefing. 
His next appointment is usually with his press secretary, Jody 
Powell. 
Then comes 
Frank 
Moore, an assistant for Congres­ sional liaison 
The rest of his day is filled with regular weekly commitments

 such as senior staff meetings. 
Cabinet sessions and luncheons with Vice President Walter Mon- dale on Mondays and biweekly breakfasts with 
Congressional leaders. 
On days when he does not have a working lunch, the President usually eats with Mrs. Carter in the family dining room at 12:3o pm 
Lunch is usually a salad or soup and a sandwich made of leftovers from the previous night’s dinner. 
Rosalynn often eats her sand­ wich open-faced to save calories. 

Amy takes the same sort of luncheon fare to school with her 
— a sandwich of cold left over meat, a thermos of soup and a bag of potato chips. 
Occasionally she buys lunch at school, and often she buys milk and chocolate or vanilla ice cream to top off her homemade lunch. 
After lunch, the President re­ turns lo his office and works there until 6 or 6:3o p.m. 
The other Carters, meanwhile, are busy with their own activities. 
Rosalynn, who is a night per- 
WHITE HOUSE LIFE IS ‘JUST LIKE IN PLAINS’ 
THE CARTER sons and their wives maintain separate living quarters across the hall from each other on the third floor of the White House and each sched­ ules their own activities. 
Each couple has a three-room suite with bath. Both suites are decorated in the Carters’ favorite color, mint green 
Jeff, 24. and his wife, Annette, 
24, favor antiques. They sleep in an old-fashioned canopy bed An­ nette brought her pet parakeet. 
Blueberry, to share the room. and from the White House warehouse she has added Abraham Lincoln's straight backed chair and Thomas 
Jefferson’s inkwell. 
Chip. 26, and his wife, Caron, 
25, have gone into modern fur­ nishings One room of their suite has been* decorated as a nursery for their newborn son, James to ri Carter IV. 
The baby—known as James not 
Jimmy—sleeps in a crib used by 
John Kennedy Jr. The room is al­ 

 so tumisnea wun a cue si ut mow­ ers used by Caroline Kennedy, a changing table bought by his par­ ents, and a rocking chair used by 
Caron’s mother to rock all her babies. 
“When we’re upstairs at the 
White House, it s just like being back home in Plains," said Caron. 
“We don’t think, 
We’re at the 
White House ’ Upstairs is home.’’ 
Only bigger, added Chip with a laugh Down in Plains he and his wife lived in an $8,1oo mobile home. “The second house trailer from the post office,” he ex­ plained. 
Chip also appreciates having daily access to his father after months of being separated from him during the campaign 
Dad makes a conscious effort to involve us in what’s going on,” 
Chip explained “ For instance, he got Brzezinski to do an over all policy thing for us, for top staff and family.” The President has also arranged for State Depart­ 

 ment instructors to provide tree 
Spanish lessons three mornings a week for Rosalynn and Caron. 
Tile young Carters breakfast at staggered hours and then go their separate ways. 
Jeff is completing his education at George Washington University, just a few blocks from the White 
House The equivalent of a junior, 
Jeff is majoring in geography. 
The youngest-looking 
Secret 
Service men have been assigned to Jeff so they can blend in with the college students. 
Annette, who has a degree in home economics and interior de­ sign from the University of Geor­ gia, is helping Jeff become accli­ mated to being a student again and doing occasional stand-in du­ ty for her mother-in-law. 
Annette’s mother, Dorothy Dav­ is of Arlington, Ga , says: “ With no cooking, no washing and no beds to make, she s really anxious to do something. But she’ll do whatever Rosalynn wants her to.” 

Chip Carter has an $8,ooo-a- year, part-time iob with the Dem­ ocratic National Committee rais­ ing funds and finding speakers for congressional candidates. 
Chip has also taken on assignments for his father since coming to the White House. In one month, he traveled to Buffalo, 
N Y., to inspect the winter storm damage and to Bombay, India, to escort his grandmother, Miss Lil­ lian Carter, to the funeral of the president of India. 
Only one of President and Mrs. 
Carter’s four children is not living in the White House with them. 
Their oldest son, John William 
(Jack) Carter, 29, decided to re­ main in Calhoun, Ga., with wife, 
Judy, and their infant son, Jason 
James Jack, who it was revealed was booted out of the Navy for smoking marijuana, worked tire­ lessly for his father during the campaign. But after the election, he wanted no part of Washington life. 

 son, likes to stay in bed in the morning until the 
President leaves for work. But she is always up in time to join Amy in the din­ ing room for 8 a m. breakfast. 
On cold mornings this winter when the White House thermostat was set at a chilly 65 degrees, 
Rosalynn found comfort in an old treadmill that used to belong to 
Lady Bird Johnson. 
She told friends she ran on it for about a minute and a half — 
“not for the exercise but to keep warm.” 
Breakfast for 
Rosalynn is usually coffee, grape juice or mel­ on and occasionally a piece of lightly buttered toast. Amy eats a variety of cold, unsugared cereals and milk. Her favorite is com flakes. None of the Carters like a big breakfast during the week, but sometimes splurge on the weekend. 
Amy is driven six long blocks to her fourth grade classes at Thad­ deus Stevens Public School. She is accompanied by two Secret Ser­ vice agents, who wait outside of her classroom and drive her home. 
About 9.15. Rosalynn goes to her office in the East Wing, dressed in pants suit or skirt and sweater to ward off the chill. Her first task is to go over paper work with her personal assistant, 
Madeline Mac Be an. 
Twice a week, Rosalynn holds a meeting with key members of her staff of 16 women and two men. 
Lately, she has been spending much time on the telephone, trying to persuade key state legis­ lators to ratify the Equal Rights 
Amendment 
Rosalynn maintains a separate office for her work as honorary chairman of the President’s Com­ mission on Mental Health. There are 2o members on that commit­ tee to assist her. 
If there are no official func­ tions, the First tody returns to her office after lunch and works until Amy returns from school at 
3 3o p.m. 
She then devotes herself to fam­ ily matters from the time Amv returns from school until bedtime. 
Amy usually plays on the south lawn with Grits, the puppy given to her by her school teacher as a welcoming present. Grits lives in

Some afternoons, Amy brings a classmate home to the White

The President greeted the pres­ ident of Mexico with “ Hi, every­ body.” And when Canadian Prim e 
Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife, M argaret, decided to walk the short distance back to Blair

How 23o people earned $2oo,ooo-plus 
...and didn’t pay Uncle Sam one penny 

By ROGER LANGLEY 
A NEW U.S. Treasury report has made official what millions of Americans have long suspect­ ed: The rich don’t pay their fair share of taxes. 
A study just completed by the Department reveals that last year 23o persons, earning $2oo,ooo or more, escaped without having to pay Uncle Sam a penny. 
A further 327 big shots in the same earnings bracket only lost two percent of their income in Fed­ eral income tax. But a typical family of four, strug­ gling to m ake ends meet on $15,ooo a year, has to pay a whopping 18 percent tax to the U.S.

Under a complex formula, people who claim more than $1o,ooo in deductions for such items as capital gains, stock options or real estate depreciation will nave to pay a minimum tax. 
The Treasury Department study, carried out dur­ ing 1974 and 1975, revealed that: 
• The 23o persons who escaped paying U S. taxes claimed more than $2o6 million in legal deductions for such items as local taxes, political and chan table contributions and medical expenses; 
• 15 percent of other persons earning $2oo,ooo or more paid less than 2o percent in taxes. 
They. too, claimed heavily for tax deductable items amounting to an incredible $1o9 billion 
But that family man on $15,- 
ooo-a-vear can claim only $3,12o for his four dependants plus standard deduction of $2,1oo He’ll have to pay $1,771 to Uncle S a m - 
18 percent of his taxable income. 
’ Basically there are four methods by which high income persons may reduce their taxes,” says the 
Treasury Department. 

• Only half (rf the money made through capital gains is taxed. If

• Tax credits for items such as taxes paid to foreign countries. 
• Special tax computations such as income averaging, which allows a taxpayer receiving an extra large amount in one year to average the income out over sev­ eral years and pay a lesser tax rate.

“I feel everyone ought to bear the brunt of our taxes .” 

It’s a family night out for Mia and her mom 

OLD time movie fans will remember her swinging through the jungle as Jane in the Tarzan movies. But today, Maureen O’Sul­ livan is better known as the mother of actress Mia Farrow. Moth­ er and daughter recently attended a Hollywood tribute to director 
Vincente Minnelli. 

Haller She sometimes crosses out dishes and adds family favorites. 
G rits are now always available and Rosalynn also makes sure fresh vegetables are served. 
So far, they’ve chosen standard 
American fare such as casseroles, lamb chops, roast chicken, meat loaf, capon, beef, or shrimp creole, served with two fresh vegetables, a green salad and a dessert Milk, rather than wine, is served at the family dinner. 
No one is on a diet. The Prest dent, who eats lightly the rest of the day, partakes of all courses at dinner, including dessert, which varies but is often lemon chiffon pie. 
The family kitchen is kept stocked with snack items like po­ tato chips, cheese, fruit and cold meats. 
But 
Rosalvnn. who seldom snacks herself, frowns on junk food and tries to keep it away from Amy. The family food, along with pet food, toiletries and dry cleaning, is paid for monthly by the C arter family in response to a bill presented by chief usher, Rex 
Seouten 
The Carters do not pay for the staples which are bought in quant­ ity for the White I louse larder, but they are billed for all food or­ dered for the family’s private kitchen on the second floor. 
The President also supplies a petty cash fund for the chief usher to use for unexpected family ex­ penses 
Seouten refused to tell 
THE STAR how much the Carters are spending or how much the 
Gerald Fords spent in compar!- son. lodging, maid service and laun dry are free to the family. 
There are now 74 staff mem ­ bers under Stouten to care for the 
132-room mansion and its 18 acres of grounds. The White House is run by a budget of just over $2 million a year. 
After dinner, the C arters gather around the burning fireplace in the dining room and discuss the affairs of the day 
Irater, the young C arters watch television, study or retire to their rooms 
The President often slips into his second floor study to work for an hour before he goes to bed at ll pm. 
Some evenings the

Some recent films include All tile President’s

So far, the 
President has dressed each business day in a suit, shirt and tie — although he always wears a sweater while re­ laxing in the* family quarters and on weekends. 
On Sunday, Mr and Mrs Cart c r and Amy, often accompanusl by their sons and daughtersin­ law, attend the 
First 
Baptist 
Church eight blocks from the 
White House The senior Carters have become mem bers of the 
Church, and Amy was baptized there recently. 
The family likes to get out and around Washington as much as possible on weekends. 
Several times, the President has ducked the press and made unheralded appearances at the Kennedy Cen­ ter to see a play.

“ I'm not saying you can oat ev­ erything that s listed on our new plan, all tho time,” she stressed. 

‘ You must be selective. Hut you now have such a great varie­ ty to choose from.” 
Ms Nidetch, who lost 72 pounds following her own advice and has kept it off for nearly 2o years, says she has no trouble now finding the right thing to eat. 

“ I have discovered there is no place in the world where I can't find the right thing to eat," she said. 

“ I may want turkey and they don't have turkey but they have tuna There is always something within the allowed food group

THERE comes a time in every dieter’s life when the pounds just stop coming off. 
The diet that has been working up to then seems to have lost its power and the dieter is stuck on a plateau. 
Now Weight Watchers has come up with a special action plan de­ signed to help its thousands of members break through this pound loss barrier. 
Tile special Plateau Plan sub­ tracts 2oo calories a day from the basic weight reduction plan 
Weight Watchers follows. 
So women, for example, would get only 1,ooo calories a day on the Plateau Plan, compared with 
1,2oo on the basic reducing plan. 
Men would get 1,3oo, instead of 
1,5oo. 
A typical day’s menu on the 
Plateau Plan would start with a morning meal consisting of one serving of fruit, a choice of one egg or one-third cup (2x/z oz.) of semi soft cheese or one ounce of cereal with a half serving of skim milk or 2 ounces of cooked fish or 
I ounce of poultry or meat. 
Breakfast may also include one serving of bread and a beverage. 
The midday meal allows a choice of: 3 ounces of poultry, meat or cooked fish, or two eggs, or two-thirds cup (5 ounces) of soft cheese, or 2 ounces of semi­ soft or hard cheese, or 4 ounces of legumes. It also allows a serving of vegetables. One serving of bread and a beverage can be add­ ed, if desired. 
At the evening meal you may have poultry, meat or cooked fish 
—4 ounces for women and youths and six ounces for men. 
Or you may choose cooked leg limes—6 ounces for women and youths and 8 ounces for men. To this can be added vegetables.

I am s ittin g -at my desk reading and re-reading a clipping from The S ta r. 
Sunday, 2 - 6 - 7 7 , and a clipping from the National Enquirer. January 2 5 , 
1977. 
The more I read th ese a rticles and the longer I look at them, tne more yellow they become. 
These would-be (sic) journalists would lead one to believe that the American Cancer Society exists only to obtain money for high salaries of its w orkers. 
Nothing can be further from the truth. 

C ancer is the most horrendous of all d is e a s e s . 
It is the most feared of all d is e a s e s . 
S ta tistica lly , it is the second leading cau se of death. 
In youngsters to age 14, it is the number one killer of all the d is e a s e s . 

Someday — and I hope every day that it happens yesterday — the cure or control of cancer will be found. 
None of the credit will go to yellow journalist and scandal tabloid types of newspapers, but nevertheless a cure or control will be found in spite of these mental pigmies' efforts to tear down stalwart and humane organizations such as the National 
Cancer Institute and American Cancer So ciety . 

The cure or control of cancer will be found when enough b a s ic research is done — b a sic research is co stly and much of the time quite unre­ warding. 
Printed articles such as the two alluded to above really do not hamper our effort a great deal becau se sen sib le, intelligent people know there is a large co st factor in any b a sic research program. 
Look at the polio program. 
Reflect on the thousands and thousands of man­ hours and millions and m illions o f dollars expended before a control was found for this heinous d is e a se whicn strikes mostly the youngsters. 
There is still no cure for polio, but it is 1oo7, preventable. 

As a matter of historical background, the American Cancer Society was founded and chartered in 1947 a s the American Cancer S o cie ty , In c. to do one thing — to raise m on ey— to do b a sic research , to promote an aw areness of cancer amongst the general population and to render material service directly to cancer patients. 

The article to which I refer is captioned, 
Cancer Society Gobbles Up 
M o n ey .'1 This article is obviously lifted from the National Enquirer which is also known far and wide for its yellow journalism. 
Tne 
Enquirer's article is captioned, 
Enquirer Probe Uncovers Shocking 
Pacts: American Cancer Society Rece^ ed f 1o9 Million of Donations in Year — and spent only one-third for research and aid to victim s. 1 

The above-mentioned a rticle s are insults to the 9 ,o o o to 1 o ,o o o Vol­ unteers in Bexar County, T ex as, os well as the 2 .3 million Volunteers in the United States. 
None of the allegations in these two articles are backed up in any authoritative source. 
I dare say the quotes in th ese articles are by hacks who know nothing about the problems of cancer research . It would seem logical that if one wanted information about en organization, they would go to that organization to obtain it. 
Nowhere in these articles do I s^-e that any of these yellow journalists have contacted the American Cancer Society regarding their operation. 
I do know, however, that becau se of the repeated and continuous failure on the part of the National Inqu.rer to report accurately what they are told, it is a policy of bom the National Cancer Institute and the ACS not to respond directly to the Enquirer by phone or in person. 
They have been asked to submit written enquiries from th ese two a g e n cie s. 
This, apparently, they have refused to do. 

Without belaboring you with some of the ridiculous assertion s made .n the abo v- .-mentioned a r t ic le s , I would like to point out a few fa c ts . 

The very headline, "American Cancer Society Received $1o9 million 
Donations . . . ” is taken out of context from the ACS 1975 annual report. 
Actual percentages of expenditures in the 1975 report show that cf the 
$ 1 o o ,9 6 3 ,2 7 3 .o o spent, 2 7 . 1 7 went for research, 13. 3 7 went for patient services and 9 7 for community serv ices. 
1 7 . 2 7 went tor public education and 1 o . 2 7 for professional education. 
As you can plainly s e e , the total directly spent for cancer-Nghting progr ams was 
7 6 .8 % . 

The 1 9 7 5 annual n port accurately described each of the=e programs, to wit: 

Research to support b a sic scien tific studies, clin ical in v esti­ gations and conduct programs seeking new knowledge for the cure or control of ca n cer. (This is where the meat in the co c o ­ nut is regarding the cure or control of cancer — b a sic research . 
Public education: 
Programs designed to inform the public about cancer prevention and symptoms an i to encourage pf riodic physical exam ination. 
(Not too many years ago cancer of the cervix was the biggest cancer killer in the fem ale. 
Today it is amongst the low est in rate due to the Papanicolou smear tech ­ nique of detecting early cancer of the cervix.) 

Professional education: 
Programs designed to improve the knowledge, sk ills and techniques of the medical and allied health professions in the detection and treatment of cancer. 
(Example: Cancer seminars are held throughout the country for the medical and allied professions in order to more adequately and rapidly deal with can cer.) 
Patient services: To provide information, counseling, nursing and homemaking se r v ic e s, transportation, d ressin g s, and loan clo set item s. (Example: All materials which the Cancer Society Units have are available to any cancer patient regardless of ability to pay — there is no charge for this serv ice.) 
Community Services: To provide for programs in cancer d etection , m ass screening, rehabilitation and development of Cancer reg istries. 
(Example: Untold numbers of early, cancer of the breast in the female have been found due to the Cancer So ciety 's effort to provide brochures explaining to the patinnt how she may herself examine her breasts for possible malignant chang es. 
Example: M ass screening in this County last year by the dental profession uncovered 
1o8 abnormal lision s of the oral cavity. 

Keep in mind that all of this work was done by Volunteers including the d en tists. 
The Enquirer article says that more than 574 of every dollar raised goes for salaries and administrative e x p e n se s. 
This is an untruth. 
The facts of the matter are these: 
29$ of the dollar given to the Society went for staff salaries (our o ffic e rs, you re a liz e , are unpaid Volunteers). 
5^ went for administrative expen ses such as benefits and payroll ta x e s , taken in the proper context, this is an enviable and remarkable adminis­ trative feat. 
It is a fact that our organization d oes, as in the c a se of u n iv ersities, hosp itals, research institutions and other non-profit organ­ iz a tio n s, spend a significant amount of money for staff help to develop and guide cancer control programs and research a c tiv itie s . 
Indeed, the effective management of functions are carried out by staff personnel to insure the effective expenditure of monies donated by the public. You would never surmise that there is only one staff person for every nine- hundred Volunteers. j*. 4 r

MOUNTAIN carver kore/ak Ziolkowski sits in front of his latest crea­ tion—a monument to the famed Sioux warrior Crazy Horse. But this is only a model. The real thing is 34 times bigger and is being blasted out of the mountains at Custer, S.D., near the scene of Crazy Horse’s defeat of Genera! Custer. Ziolkowski, 66, who helped carve Mount Kush- niore, says this 641-ft long-by 563-ft. high monument will take at least five years to complete.

I don’t believe anyone in 

I Washington could honestly tell you how many costly 
Senate investigation com ­ mittees have been set up in 

I the last year. 

In Washington, investigating 
[committees are as common as the 
[muggers in tin* street. But for all the taxpayers’ millions spent on these useless platforms for sena­ tors’ egos, there is one I would like 
[to see set up. 
And that would be a Senate 
[committee to investigate the wel­ fare agencies that are taking the taxpayer for the greatest ride 
I since the roller coaster 
It has now become an accepted 
[joke how many millions of people get welfare without deserving it. 
I But le t’s forget that for now 
Let’s turn our attention to a 
[shocking tragedy in Athens, 
Term., where Ronald Maddux and his wife Wanda were convicted of torturing their four-year-old 
[daughter Melisha to death. It w as 

I alleged that after being drunk for 

I two days, Ronald Maddux beat his 
[daughter with a stick and almost forced a bottle of hot sauce down 
| the poor little girl’s throat. 
This column does not set guilt. 
| The court has already done that — 
[sentencing the Maddux couple to 
99 years in jail. 
As if the case itself is not frightening enough, enter the 
Welfare Department. When Meli- sha was ll months old, both Mr. and Mrs. Maddux were jailed for six months for child abuse. 
Last May, some genius from that department, a social worker, 
[decided the Madduxes were now fit and proper parents. Little Me­ lisha was returned from a chil- 
[dren's home to their “ care.” 
On October 12, |>oor little Meli- sha’s body was found. 
Now instead of launching a wholesale investigation into who the social worker was, how much training he or she had, and on what grounds was this person an instant psychiatrist, the State of 
[Tennessee did something else 
Because of the furor that broke 
[out among decent citizens over this case, the paper-shuffling bur­ eaucrats did the predictable thing and compounded the monstrosity. 
[They immediately took on, at tax­ payers’ expsense, an additional 
117 social workers to reduce the caseloads. 
Now, I don’t give a damn who I offend with my next statement. 
But my experience in New York and Los Angeles with social workers has l»een one of disgust. 
In New York, the jails are filled with social workers whom police have found to be pushing drugs. It is filled with a number of social workers who have been involved in welfare rip-offs. Now, these state agenc ies are partly funded by federal taxes. Our damn mon­ ey. 
One young lady I know who had sense enough to get out and is now seeking a law degree is of the opinion that no department in the administration of New York is more filled with psychopathic misfits than New York state 
Social Welfare. 
And these are the people suppo­ sedly attending to the probelms of other humans. 
There doesn’t seem to be any standard set by any government body, state, federal or local, for what a social welfare worker should be. 
Their ranks seemed to be filled by wandering bleeding hearts, looking for a good pay day. They arc not quite qualified for a car­ 

 eer. so they rocket themselves into social worll. The hours are flexi­ ble, the pay is good. 
The Tennessee General Assem­ bly is now trying to push through legislation that would prohibit a social welfare worker returning children to unfit parents unless with the specific approval of the 
State Human Service Commis­ sioner. 
For Melisha Maddux, that ac­ tion has come a little late. 
It’s about time both Washington and the state legislatures took a very hard look at the very fat, costly and appallingly run organi­ zation called Social Welfare. 
Its maintenance is coming out of your pocket, which is bad enough, but when the Melisha Madduxes of this world don’t get proper pro-* tection from the organizations we pay for, then ifs gone too far. 
The Charitable rich 
There is nothing more annoying to a person who works for a living than to hear about the “ guilty rich." They are people, usually. who head protest groups and beat their breasts in public for for­ giveness because they were born wth with a buck. 
They are at the core of the radi­ cal chic who wear carefully-torn blue jeans to make them look like one of the guys. They picket the 
White House and they used to scream at Vietnam veterans. 
News this week comes from 
Cambridge, Mass. of a group called The Haymarket People’s 
Fund. They are made up of people who say outrightly they feel wrong about being rich and they want to do something about it. They have set up a charity fund. 
Last year. Haymarket raised 
$2oo,oo(1 from 3oo donors who are reportedly very rich. Now that works out at an average of $75o per year from people w ho say they are very rich. If these very rich peo­ ple HAVE to form an organization and get their pictures in the newspapers to come up with $75o a each a year, let me tell them so­ mething. 
I know New Jersey truck drivers who give that much each year to charity. And they don’t belong to any organization. And they don’t get their pictures in the paper and they AIN’T rich. They just give and shut up. 
There is nothing wrong about being rich and ifs nice if you want to give to charity. But I don’t think you have to form a special organ­ ization with newspaper stories and photographs of members to be generous. Particularly when 3oo donors give an average of $75o in one year. 

Copt. Hydro wages war on drought 

A CAPED crusader called Cap­ tain Hydro is helping schoolchil­ dren learn all about water conser­ vation. 
Captain Hydro is the character invented by education officials in the Santa Clara Valley water dis­ trict, in drought-hit northern Cali­ fornia. 
The cartoon character is teach­ ing children about conservation methods, climatic conditions that produce rain, how to read a water meter, how to do steam and well gauging and how to solve water waste problems.

STAR GOSSIP 
Carroll 
O’Connor tries to censor life story 

Angie Dickinson and ner for Bette Davis, have become frequent companions. Both are separated, and renewed their friendship while filming together. 

THE cantankerous character of televi­ sion’s Archie Bunker seems to be af­ fecting the actor who plays him, CAR­ 
ROLL O'CONNOR. 
The $11o,ooo-a-show star of All In The 
Family has taken an ad in a trade newspa­ per urging his friends not to cooperate with the author of an unauthorized biography now being compiled on O’Connor. 
‘ To put it succinctly,” he says in the ad, 
“ I am writing my own book. So tell the bum nothing!” 
Perhaps Carroll — or is it really Archie 
— needs the money? 
The course of true love never runs smooth, even for WARREN BEATTY'. 
After a separation of a year, the 
TREAT YOUR BABY LIKE AN ADULT AND HEU 
GROW UP A LOT SMARTER, SAYS EXPERT 
YOU can raise your baby's IQ by making his life more interesting, a leading child care expert ad­ vised this week. 
Babies left alone to become bored end up with IQs 2o percent below their potential, said author 
Joan Beck. 
‘ Don’t treat your baby like an invalid who nekls to live in bed and be quiet most of the time,” said Ms Beck, who has just pub­ lished a revised edition of her book How To Raise A Brighter 

Child (Pocket Books, $195). She explains that infants learn through movement and the stimu­ lation of all their senses. 
Her book gives parents specific mind-building techniques to follow from the first day the infant is brought home from the hospital. 
She had these tips for caring for babies in the first six months of life: 
• Talk to your baby from the very first day—and not baby talk.

Roadies give earthquake alarm 
COCKROACHES may soon be helping scientists predict earthquakes, according to experts at the U.S. Geological Survey. Researchers in Cal­ ifornia have discovered that before an earthquake, there is a big in­ crease in cockroaches* activity. Dr. Ruth Simon, who is heading the research, said: “The period immediately before a quake is very unset­ tling for the little critters. Their behavior may one day help us predict when a quake is coming."

• When he begins to babble, talk back to him. If he makes the same sound consistently, repeat it to him. Sing and play records for him as well. 
• Expose him to bright colors and interesting shapes. Hang a new mobile over his bed every few days. Later, hang a plastic ball, a bell or a simple toy on the side of the bed for nim to bat. 
• Paint the walls of his room a bright color. Tack up bold graph­ ics for him. 
• When he can hold up his head, carry him around in a can­ vas sling that holds him on your back or hip. This gives him a wid­ er view of his world. 
• As you bathe, feed and change him. direct his attention to different objects and name them, 
• Don’t keep him in a bassi­ nette crib all the time. Let him lie in a playpen or on a pad on the floor so he can move freely. 
• Don’t constrict his move­ ments with too much clothing or linens and blankets. 

“Roaming Romeo’’ of Hollywood has been seen around town again with his former live-in girlfriend, British actress JULIE 
CHRISTIE. 
But at a party hosted by Mr. BARBRA 
STTREISAND — hairdresser-tumed-movie producer JON PETERS — Beatty and Ju­ lie had an argument over his recent friend­ ship with the beautiful MICHELLE PHIL­ 
LIPS. 
Julie accused Beatty of only taking her out while he was waiting for Michelle to come back to him . . . and then stormed out of the party in a temper. 
Will Michelle come back to him? She’s thinking, I hear. of moving back into the house JACK NICHOLSON bought her five years ago next to his house in Beverly 
Hills. That friendship, she says, is purely platonic. 
Mich'rlle, meanwhile is in great demand from the major film stu­ dios. They are impressed with her after seeing rough cuts of her lat­ est picture. Valentino. She made the KEN RUSSELL movie for 
$6,ooo — but is now receiving six figure offers.

Bardot signs for sexy role in Hollywood

Comedian Rich 
Little can hardly keep a straight face 
— even when he’s trying to be himself. 
He's enjoying an evening out in 
L.A. with his wife Jeanne. 

BRIGITTE BARDOT, who at 41 is still the most famous sex symbol around today, is to make a film in Hollywood. 
She accepted the lead role in the movie version of 
IRVING WALLACE S The Fan Club after it was turned down by some of America's best looking and most talented beauties. 
They included 
RAQUEL WELCH, 
VALERIE 
PERRINE, BARBRA STREISAND and STELLA

 of the sizzling plot in which a famous film star is kid­ naped by five men and held in a mountain retreat. 
It seems that the script was too graphic for them. 
Indeed if it is faithful to the book she will spend most of the film tied to a bed. 
Producer LAWRENCE GORDON was approached by the sex kitten’.! agent who asked him to pencil her in the role. It seems that she wanted a part that will prove she is as sexy as ever — and this certain­ ly fills the bill. 
Now Bardot is looking for a house to rent in Bev­ erly Hills, ready for Gordon to start making the film later this year. 
Columbia Pictures, who are negotiating her sala­ ry, are ecstatic at their coup.

FOLKLORE FORECASTERS FORESEE FUNNY 
A LOT of weather information can still be acquired from groundhogs, Granny's big toe and hornets’ nests. 

Three of THE STAR s forecast­ ers last year predicted the Big 
Freeze of this winter, so we con­ sulted them for their Spring and 
Summer forecasts 

In Florida, Marianne Luzon of 
St. Petersburg keeps an eye on the lake to see what the ducks are doing “ If they head north early, we are in for a long, hot sum­ mer,” she reports 
“This year 

WEATHER they were off like a shot in mid- 
February—which is early.” 
Flo Proctor of Elkhorn, Wis., had this advice: “ If it rains on 
Easter, it will rain for the next seven Sundays. And the direction the wind blows Easter morning will be the prevailing wind the next 4o days. East or south-east means 4o days of damp or cold. 
“ Incidentally, to get the temp^ erature in Fahrenheit without a thermometer, just count 14 sec­ 

 onds of cricket chirps and add 
4o,” says Flo, 
“Granny” Harris, whose big toe lias never failed her, is predicting more drought in California, de­ spite a little bit of rain around mid March. 
Mrs. Harris, who lives in May­ wood, Calif., sees some gusty days in March and April June will be bikini weather without a doubt, she says. 
But she can't predict past that 
— Granny dropped the cookie jar on her toe just as she was getting to July. 

Honesty on restaurant menus urged 

RESTAURANT menus should be more truthful, says the Michigan 
Restaurant Association. 
"Hie group has adopted a state­ wide “Truth in Menu” policy which says member restaurants cannot “knowingly list any items tm their menus by a false or mis­ leading name.” 
Some of the misrepresentations the association said appear on menus around the nation include. 
• “Butter” for margarine, 

• “Rock Cornish Game Hen" when a small, regular chicken is served; 

 canned pork 
• "Ham ” when shoulder is served 

Such practices give the offend­ ing restaurant an unfair price ad­ vantage over those which actually do serve what their menus show.
