Players in the Spur dressing room agreed with fans in the m en’s restroom at the Arena 
Friday night after Boston eli- minatad San Antonio from the 
NBA playoffs. 
In both rooms, the consensus was that the better team had won this best-of-three playoff series. In six games this year. Boston did not lose to the Spurs.

The g rea t 1977 battle for mayor of San Antonio winds up 
Saturday, not with a whimper, but a bang. 
M ayor Lila Cockrell and John 
Monfrey close out the bout, with Mon- trey throwing heavy punches from flat on his back in a hospital room and 
Mrs. Cockrell flicking off the blows with her gloves. 
Both candidates arc shooting where their ducks are — Mrs. Cockrell in the huge North Side arc which produced

 most of her votes April 2 and Monfrey in the West and East side repositories of votes expected to be favorable to him. 

Going for the ducks may be an ap­ p ro p ria te term for election day 
Saturday. 
Rain is expected and voters will probably have to slosh their ways to the polls. 
The city’s polling places will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday. 

Voters in four of the city’s districts 
— I. 8, 9 and IO — will vote only in the mayoral race because they elected their councilmen two weeks ago in the first primary. 

Voters., however, in Districts 2, 3, 4, 
5. ii and 7 will vole for a councilman as well as a mayoral choice. 
Elected to two-year term s April 2 were incumbent Councilmen Henry 
Cisneros, District I; Phi! Pyndus. Dis­ trict 8; Glen Hartman, District 9, and newcomer John Steen, District IO.

“ Any team that beats us six times in a row is a better team." he reasoned. 
“ Are they better?” George Gervin repeated. “ Well, I would look like a liar if I said we were better. They are the champions. We had ‘em down so many tim es but they always came back. 

Competitive 
"I don't want to look crazy by saying we are better but I do think we are competitive. Boston, well, they are great,” said Gervin. 

Meanwhile, in a nearby restroom, many of the fans were in total agree­ ment with Fault/. 
“ Hey,” said one beer-bellied man far back in the line, “ you can tell this is a money game. can't you? Boston is like a machine. When it comes time to play for money, Boston is going to win.’’ 

“ T h e y ’re a bunch of obnoxious 
(Bleeps), but 
I must admit they are better than the Spurs,” added a fan in the back of the restroom. 
Still, some of the Spur players re­ fused lo admit that Boston had a better team. 

“ Evidently, they beat u s ,” said guard Mike Gale when asked if the 
Spurs had lost to a superior team. “ I guess they proved something.” 
Disagreement 
“ I wouldn’t say that.” argued for­ ward Larry Kenon. “ Overall. I don’t think they arc better. I can't put my finger on why they beat us. 
“ But they are the only team that runs us. Other teams we play, we run them. But Boston runs us,” said Ken­ on. 
“ I don't know if they are better. I don't want to comment on that,’’ said a 

 dejected Mark OI herding. 
Olberdingdid admit Boston s playoff experience proved to be a big differ­ ence. 
“ Gosh, sure it was.” he said, shak­ ing his head while drying off after show ering. “ They are the world c ham ps. They are good. We were tight.” 
Most of the Spurs felt Boston played better in S A. Friday than it did at home in the Boston Garden Tuesday. 
“ T o nig h t,” said O lberding. “ we played as hard as we can play but we still came up on the short end.” 
“ Jo Jo (White). Jo Jo was the dif­ 

 ference. Jo Jo was the key,” said 
Kenon. “ He was everything. I don't think he missed. He got his rhythm and it was all over. He did a job on us,” 
Kenon said of the Boston guard who scored 38 points by hitting 13 of 19 from the field. 
“ I have idolized J o J o for m any years and he really showed me why tonight,” said Gervin. “ I have a lot of respect for the guy. He’s fantastic.’’

AUSTIN —■ The public school finance bill is expected to re-emerge on the 
House floor Monday, chopped into six pieces and all bearing Gov. Dolph 
Briscoe’s emergency legislation tags. 
This means they can be expedited without going down the long procedur­ al road required of most legislation. 
HB75o was blown to smithereens 
Thursday alter nearly three days of debate. 
What was left of HB75o plus the five new bills were branded emergency legislation by the governor. 
The House Education Committee worked into the early hours Friday trying to pick up the pieces. 
By F rid ay m orning, com m ittee chairman Tom Massey of San Angelo was headed for Briscoe’s office with the results of a frantic night’s efforts to save the measure. 
With him he carried a letter asking the governor to place emergency le­ gislation tags on five new bills. 
Carter announces new assault on inflation 

NEW YORK TIME service 
WASHINGTON - The Carter administration outlined Friday a largely voluntary plan d e­ signed to cut the inflation rate two percentage points, to about 4 per cent, by the end of 1979. 
It relies, as expected, on an effort to enlist the cooperation of business and labor in m oderating the wage-priee spiral and on a host of measures the

However, despite repeated a s s u r­ ances by administration officials that there would be nothing in the package involving controls or coercion, it ap­ peared there would be some such cle­ ments to contain the cost of hospital care, a sector in which prices have been climbing by more than twice the over-all inflation rate. 

Pressure mounting 

President Carter, in presenting his anti-inflation plan at a televised news conference, noted that inflationary pressures have mounted for the past few m o nths and d eclared his u n ­ willingness to attack this “ very diffi­ cult and pernicious problem” by deli­ berately restraining the economy. 
The centerpiece of the adm inistra­ tion's price strategy is the agreement by representatives of business and la­ 

 bor to participate in a joint effort to persuade their constituents that curb­ ing wages and prices is in their own best interests as well as those of the country. 
This collaboration, the President said in his statement, “ should consist of working together to advise govern­ ment on its objectives for our econ­ omy, for job creation, and inflation reduction, to help work our approaches to achieve these objectives and to monitor the results on a continuing basis.”

Each o f the five new hills leas once p a r t o f a neat package known as [IHT.MI 

He was also asking for the same emergency designation for the already embattled teacher pay raise bill which appears in trouble even before it gets to the House floor. 
Each of the five new bills was once part of a neat package known as 
IIB75o. 
Clayton ruling 
W ednesday, House Speaker Bill 
Clayton ruled an attempt to graft a teacher pay raise onto HB75o was out of order. 
His decision to rule ag ainst the teacher pay raise amendment came back to haunt him 24 hours later. 
The salary issue was not included in the governor’s emergency measure message, allowing early consideration of HB75o, Clayton ruled. 
Late Thursday afternoon. Rep. John 
Bryant of Dallas raised his own bomb­ shell point of order. 
Bryant said there were at least IB other items in HB75U also not included in the scope of the governor’s em er­ gency message. 
Locked in by his ruling of Wednes­ day, Clayton had no choice but to uphold B ryant’s point of order and send HB75o back to committee. 

Debate on the bill was ended until the committee could come up with something. 
Overnight. HB75o gave birth to five new bills. Each contains one or more of the items ruled out by Bryant’s point of order. 
The new bills born from HB75o in­ clude: 
• AD VALOREM TAX RELIEF: By raising the state’s share of the foun­ dation school program from 75 to 85 per cent, local school districts will have to come up w ith only 15 per cent local funding. 
HB75o, and the new bill, mandates the IO per cent must be shared by the districts with local property owners in the form of an ad valorem tax cut. 
Tax cuts 
State-wide, the tax cut will amount to some $357 million, and pumps back about $3.7 million to the 12 school dis­ tricts in Bexar County for a one-time only tax cut in 1978-79. 
• PERSONNEL UNITS: Sets new standards of teacher-to-pupil ratios in public schools. 
• 
HOLD HARMLESS CLAUSES: 
The current school finance law con­ tains a “ hold ha rm le ss c la u se ” to guarantee small school districts (those with less than 1,ooo average daily at­ tendance) don’t lose teachers. 
The new bill, as well as HB75o, de­ leted this clause.

Spanish patriot to end long exile 

During the Spanish Civil War 
Dolores Ibarruri was known as La 
Pasionaria (the Passion Flower) and her speeches electrified Loya­ list crowds with the rallying cry of 
“ No P a sa ra n ” (They Shall Not 
Pass). With the victory of the forces of Francisco Franco Miss Ibarruri, who still is the President of the 
Spanish Communist Party, fled to 
Moscow where she has lived ever since. 
Earlier this month Spain lega­ lized the Communist Party and 
Miss Ibarruri, now 82, is planning to return in about two weeks to ebe a candidate in this spring’s parlia­ mentary elections.

Shoplifting is one thing. Taking an entire store is something else. 
Henry H. Keller. 4o, threatened to sue the Yuma County Sheriff’s office for $17,5oo if deputies did not recover Keller’s Air Base Grocery 
Store in one week. 

Deputy Terry Wagner met the deadline after he found out that 
Keller had not been operating the store and had been selling off the building, section by section. 

The entire building disappeared after Keller sold the roof to Junior 
Sanchez, a contractor who speaks little English, the investigator said. 
Sanchez, whit thought he had purchased the entire building, sold

Hints for writers 

The Virginia School Boards As- sociationa has offered a few tongue-in-cheek rules for beginning writers in its monthly newsletter: 
“ Don’t use no double negative. 
Make each pronoun agree with their antecedent. Join clauses good, like a conjunction should. 
“ About them sentence fragments. 
When dangling, watch your partici­ ples. Verbsrhas to agree with their subject. 
“ Proof-read your writing to see if you any words out. 
“ C o red spelling is absolutely essential.”

It was all too frustrating for 
Robert L. Mannah, who finally said. “ I just couldn't do it.” 

On April I. Mannah went down into a hole in Dover, Del. and vowed to stay buried alive for 122 days to break what he thought was the previous world's record of IDI days. 
First he found that the previous 

 record was not Itll but 217 days. 
Then he found that editors of 
Guinness’ Book of World Records would not be including live burials in next y e a r's edition because they’re too dangerous. 
“ After that I didn t see any sense in staying down.” Mannah said as he ended his underground stay after 
12 days. 
FBI: Mormon will phony 

A S S O C IA T E D P R ESS 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. - FBI in­ vestigators have concluded the late Howard Hughes did not write the so-called “ Mormon w ill,” attributed to him, according to Nevada Atty. Gen. 
Robert List. 

The battle over Hughes’ vast estate became the first-ever court proceeding in the state to be covered by television cameras for delayed viewing by the public at home. 
List revealed Friday that handwrit­ ing analysis conducted by two FBI in­ vestigators working independently has produced a conclusion that the three- 

 page handwritten document was not penned by the late industrialist. 
List noted, however, that the battery of tests which he has asked the FBI to conduct on the purported will have not been concluded, but that they should be within the next week. He also said the FBI has, as yet, been unable to determine who authored the document w hich was found in the Mormon Chuch headquarters in Salt Lake City. 
With the consent of Clark County 
District Court Judge Keith Hayes and the participating attorneys, a portable camera from KLAS-TV in Las Vegas was allowed to record the proceedings. 
KLAS officials then fed the videotape and sound to the three major networks and other stations who joined in the pool coverage. 
Cameraman Erie Bock, stationed in the box normally occupied by w it­ nesses. zoomed in on List as he stepped to the podium and related the exten­ sive efforts made to determ ine who authored the “ Mormon will.” 
Unskilled 
List said the two FBI investigators, using scores of exemplars of Hughes’ handwriting, are of the opinion that the 
“ Mormon will” represents “ an un­ skilled attempt to copy or simulate” 
Hughes’ style. 
But List said the FBI and the Al­ cohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department have not been able to determine the age of the paper the will is written on, or the age of the ink used. 
List said investigators a re now checking latent fingerprints found on the will and its two outer envelopes for comparison with those his office has obtain from persons who may have handled the will after its discovery and from possible suspects who may have forged the document. 
List said it will be at least a month before he will be able to decide w hat, if any, criminal charges will be filed. 
Dununar 
Melvin Dummar, a former service station operator from Utah, is the center of the controversy surrounding the purported will. 
Dummar. whom the will names as the heir to one-sixteenth of the Hughes estate, admitted delivering the will to the church, after initially saying he did not know how the document got to Salt 
Lake City. 
Additionally, Dummar’s thumbprint was found on the outer envelope in which the will was found. 
According to List, some of the FBI’s findings seem to indicate that Dum­ mar was telling the truth in January, when he appeared in court here and said he steamed open the envelope containing the will after a mysterious stranger delivered it to the service station he used to operate in Willard, 
Utah.

Torture, murder still prevail in

$15o,ooo of his own money into the defense of the will, seemed unphased by List’s report. 
“ What we have is another opinion,” said Rhoden, who represents former 
Hughes aide Noah Dietrich. The pur­ ported will names Dietrich as the ex­ ecutor of Hughes’ estate. 
Hill says 
Hughes’ tax huge 

AUSTIN (AP) — Atty. Gen. John 
Hill believes Texas will collect at least 
$15o million iii inheritance taxes from the estate of Howard Hughes. 
“ Texas is really the only rightful claimant,” Hill told a news conference 
Friday. 
Hill said Texas’ case is so strong that the struggle among several states to tax Hughes as a resident may be set­ tled voluntarily. 
“ We have accumulated more than 
3o.ooo documents right in this office to show that Howard Hughes never in­ tended to make his domicile anywhere but Texas,” Hill said. 
The latest evidence was filed Thurs­ day in a Houston probate court in which Dr. Ellsworth Alvord Jr.! a professor of pathology at the 
University of Washington, said special tests of brain tissue and nervous sys­ tem sections showed that “ in all rea­ sonable medical probability Howard 
Hughes was not afflicted by any struc­ tural or neurological disease affecting his mental competence.” 
A Texan’ 
Hill said m ost of the s ta te 's documentation comes from bank and tax records, including a 1944 letter in which Hughes said: “ I ani a Texan, w ill always be a Texan and I will never change my mind.” 
He said he thought recent estimates of the size of the estate were way off. 
“This estimate that the estate is only about $188 million is ridiculous,” lie said. “ We know he sold property worth more than $BoU million in the last few years of his life . . . I believe it is much nearer to $1 billion plus. . . . I still don’t rule out it might as high as $2 billion.” 
Hill said the trial on the estate taxes might be postponed from the present 
September date but he would expect it to be held in 1978 with the appeals fin­ ished by 1979 at the latest. 

 power. 
Five Latin American nations, out­ raged at the Carter administration’s criticism of their repressive police states, have refused to accept further 
American military aid. 
But this face-saving attempt hasn t stifled the efforts of their people to achieve basic human freedoms. 
Incredible story 

We have heard the grim stories of many victims who have been brutally mistreated by these military govern­ ments. But rarely have we heard a tale as detailed, credible and moving as that of Enrique Rodriguez Larreta. 
He is prominent journalist from one of Uruguay’s oldest and most distin­ guished families. 
He flew to Buenos Aires last July to tra c e the d isap p e a ra n ce of his 
28-year-old son, also a jour­ nalist, who had emigrated to 
Argentina years ago. 
The anxious father spoke with sev eral officials and wrote numerous letters. 
On the night of July 13, a group of armed men dressed 
"In.. in plain clothes bashed in the door of his daughter-in-law's apartment. 
They handcuffed both Larreta and his daughter-in-law, tied hoods over their heads and drove them in their night clothes to a room with about 3o other people. 
Through his loosely woven hood, 
Larreta recognized his son and several other prom inent people, including 
Margarita Michelini, the daughter of an Uruguayan senator who had been assassin ated in Buenos Aires, and 
Leon Duarte, an Uruguayan labor or­ ganizer who had disappeared. 
Interrogation 

The guards began shoving prisoners upstairs for interrogation. “ Because of the piercing screams that I could hear constantly,” Larreta told our associate 
Joseph Spear. “ I realized they were being brutally tortured.” 
The next evening, it was L arreta’s turn. “ They stripped me completely naked. Tying my hands behind my back, they suspended me by the wrists 
. . . They put a sort of loincloth on me, on which there were several exposed electrical wires. When that device is plugged in. the victim receives electric shocks at several points simultaneous­ ly. This ‘machine,’ as they call it, is plugged in amidst questions, threats, insults and blows to the most sensitive parts of the body.” 
Throughout the ordeal. L arreta s tormentors asked him questions about the political activities of his son and himself. 
L arreta reported that his guards 
“ seemed to belong to the Argentine arm y.” but Uruguayan army officers also participated in the torture ses­ sions, he said. 
Water torture 

At one point, the guards suspended a water-filled tank from the ceiling, tied a prisoner named Carlos Santucho to a rope, and dangled him over the tank. 
Ile was “ lowered repeatedly into the tank and pulled out again, am idst laughter and insults.” Larreta recalls. 
“ After awhile, they apparently noticed that Santucho’s body showed no signs of life . . . and took him away." 
On July 2B. Larreta was tied up and thrown into a truck with some other prisoners. 

They were hauled to a military air­ port in Buenos Aires, flown to a base near Montivideo. and deposited in an 
Uruguayan house of torture. 
Finally, in late August, the captors tried to convince their prisoners to take part in a phony guerrilla attack. 
Afterward, the prisoners would be represented by lawyers at a military trial and would later go to prison. But their lives would be spared. 
Staged raid 

Fourteen prisoners agreed to the deal; the phony raid was staged, and the captives were paraded before the press. The government officially an­ nounced that it had broken up a huge 
“ subversive organization.” 
Because of Larreta’s spotless record and moderate political credentials, the

 captors could not make a case against him. He was eventually released. His son remains in prison. 
Meanwhile, fear is mounting in the armed camp called Argentina, where 

Because o f Larreta's spotless record and moderate political credentials, the captors could not m ake a case against him. 

 the military junta, under Gen. Jorge 
Rafael Videla. must use force to keep its shaky hold on the reins of power. 
Top Argentine officials, therefore, are unhappy about C a rte r’s human rights offensive. Argentina is a “nation under siege,” the g en erals claim. 
There’s no room, they insist, for nor­ mal court procedures. 
Their views have been reported to 
House Speaker Thomas “ Tip” O’Neill by Rep. Fred Richmond, D-N.Y., in a confidential account of his recent Ar­ gentine visit. 
Kidnapings 
A recent wave of kid naping s,^ meanwhile, has forced wealthy Argen­ tines to retreat behind elaborate se­ curity measures. 
Many citizens have not dared to venture out of doors for months. 

Even in the well-guarded U.S. em ­ bassy in Buenos Aires, American Am­ bassador Robert Hill won t go swim­ ming or play tennis without a dozen 
Marines to protect him. 

Iii Paraguay, hundreds of citizens have been im p riso ned and cruelly tortured by police officials paranoid about any hint of opposition. 

But while the nation's 2.5 million people live in poverty, Gen. Alfredo 
Stroessner lives like a proverbial king. 

The greedy dictator has kept Para­ guay under a virtual state of siege since 1954. except for the infrequent 
“ elections” which he invariably wins. 

Carter’s stubborn support of human rights has yet to persuade the dictators of Latin America to ease their oppres­ sive rule. 

Officials at the Uruguayan embassy told us they knew nothing of Larreta’s case but promised us they would “ in­ vestigate” it. 

They had not responded at the time we went to print. 
Oilman urges oil imports cut 

■ 
WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) - The president of the American Petroleum 
Institute said Friday the United States should aim to reduce its oil imports by more than half. 

Speaking at an economics forum at 
Babson College, Frank N. Ikard said the United States currently is import­ ing 42 per cent of its petroleum needs. 
Ile said the first aim of President 
Carter’s new energy program should be to cut that figure to 15 to 21) per cent, but he did not specify a deadline for the reduction.

SAN CLEMENTE. Calif. (AP) - 
Two women given a brief glimpse into the private world of Richard Nixon say the former president is lonely in exile 
— “ like Napoleon ut Elba” but was surprisingly “ very up” during taping for a series of television interviews. 
“ I think he wants to finally tell 
A m erica his side of W aterg ate — whether anyone believes him or not,” said Arline Genis, a 43-year-old inter­ ior decorator, who with Sandy Blake designed the set for the interviews conducted by television host David 
Frost. 
Very up 
“ I think people expect and hope that 
Nixon will bt* down,” said Ms. Genis. 
“ But he wasn't that way at all. He was very up. And very interested in all facets of the program. I think he’s up because he has a project.” 
But Nixon “ is a very lonely m an.” she added. “ He can’t go anywhere. He can’t make statements on government policies like other ex-presidents.” 
The interviews with Nixon, who re­ signed amid the Watergate scandal, will be broadcast by independent sta­ tions in four segments beginning May 
4. F rost’s company reportedly paid 

Nixon $1 million, but “ this is not only a monetary thing to him, I believe, but a catharsis,” Ms. Genis said. 
Ms. Genis and Ms. Blake, both of whom prefer that designation, said they tried to provide a “ homey ambience” to the set. The taping was done ut a Laguna Beach home rather than N ixon's San C lem ente e sta te because Coast Guard radar near the estate would have interfered with the recording. 
Cleared 
None of Nixon’s own furniture was included, but “ every single item on the set had to be cleared with him before it was used,” said Ms. Blake, also 43. 

The two women visited the Nixon residence in preparing for the inter­ views. 
“ lh* is now a prisoner in his own home,” said Ms. Blake. "H e is su r­ rounded by security.” 

Ms. Genis said Nixon’s quarters in­ clude small offices that are empty and an aide "tells you that’s where Khr- licjman had his office ... that’s where 
John Dean sat. It s just other worl- dish.” 

“ The biggest technical problem we had were the bookcases,” said Ms. 
Genis. “ The titles were very impor­ tant. We had to handpick all books in camera range. We were told that it would be very e m b a rra ssin g if someone blew up the titles behind 
Nixon and found ‘AU the President’s 
Men.’ for example. 
“ The Frost people specifically* wanted books on the history of the* 
United States, poetry, classics, law. 
Nixon sent us purl of his collection.” I 

Furnishing the set was somewhat of^ a problem, Ms. Blake said, because* 
“ you couldn’t exactly take Richard^ 
Nixon to the F urn itu re Mart to seej* which chair he would like.” 
Nixon wore makeup and a blue bu-; siness suit for the interviews, eon-! ducted in 12 two-hour sessions. Secret* 
Service agents watched. 

Tragic figure 

Nixon is a "sad. tragic figure" who! is using the interviews to “cleanse his soul,” said 
Ms. 
Blake. 
“ I didn’t know what I was going to feel for the man after Watergate. But my heart went out to Ins loneliness.”

San Antonio fcXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday April 16 1977 

U.S. files m otion upholding Hayes charges 

Civil rights charges against former Castroville Police Chief 
Frank Hayes are valid and 
Hayes should he tried in San 
Antonio, government attorneys argued Friday. . 
The U.S. Justice Department Civil 
Rights Division filed its answers to motions filed by H ayes’ attorney to dismiss the c harges or grant a change of venue in the ease. 
H ayes, who is se rv in g a 

 two-to 1o-year sentence in the Texas 
Department of Corrections, is charged with criminal civil rights violations for shooting R ichard M orales in Sep­ tember 1975. 
The former police chief was convict­ ed of aggravated assault in tho case last July by a state court jury in San 
Angelo. 
The federal indictment was returned in February, but Hayes has yet to enter a plea in the case because of a lengthy psychiatric examination to determine 

 bis competency to stand trial. 
Hayes was ruled competent to stand trial on the state charges, but Chief 
U.S. Dist. Judge Adrian A. Spears or­ dered another examination). 
Hayes’ wife, Dorothy, and her sister. 
Alice Baldwin, are charged as acces­ sories after the fact in the case. Both women have pleaded innocent. 
After Morales’ death, his body was driven by Mrs. Hayes’ to Mrs. Bald­ w in’s farm in E ast Texas, federal charges contend. 

In their motion to dismiss, Hayes’ attorneys argued the charges were the result of selective prosecution and the federal trial would constitute double jeopardy. 
But the government, argued the de­ cision on whether or not to prosecute belongs to the prosecutors. 
The prosecutors also said the U.S. 
Supreme Court has ruled the federal government can bring charges after a state prosecution for the same event. 
The defense lawyers have not proved 

 publicity on the trial here has made it impossible to pick a fair jury, so a change of venue is not. necessary, the government argued. 

The prosecutors also argued against a hearing on the motions presented by 
Hayes’ attorneys, William Miller and 
Marvin Miller. 
The Millers’ motion on selective prosecution alleged the decision to present the case to a grand jury came as a result of political pressure. 

The pressure, they said, came after } 
Hayes received the aggravated assault * conviction rather than murder. 

If a hearing is held, witnesses could include U.S. Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell, who approved the prosecution, and se­ veral elected politicians, including 
Texas Atty. Gen. John Hill who advo­ cated the federal trial. 
If convicted on the federal charges, 
Hayes could be sentenced to life in prison. 
Fiesta begins on rainy note 

Friday’s rainy downpour did not keep all San Antonians tucked away. Some ventured out into the early Fiesta celebrations. Marksmen, left, participated in the all-day 15th annual Fiesta 
Memorial Toepperwein Shoot at the San Antonio Gun Club and others wandered onto the carnival grounds despite muddy conditions. Both events continue Saturday. — Staff Photos by

 lf the rains continue through tile weekend the city’s street maintenance program will be back where it was three months ago — in the hole. 
Looking out a rain-spattered window 
F rid ay at City Hall, Public Works 
Director Sam Granata lamented: “ You just can’t win. But it keeps us in busi­ ness.’’ 
The city had just about caught up u itll repairs to damage from the rains of December and January. 
But if the rains continue a lot of that work will be washed out, Granata .said. 
The streets can take a heavy downpour but a continuing rain will fill the streets with pot holes. “ They’ll get real bad,” he said. 
This makes it necessary for street crews to fill in the holes on a tempor­ ary basis and again on a m ore per- 
Training jet makes safe belly landing 

A small Air Force training jet safely made an emergency landing at Ran­ dolph AFB Friday afternoon after its w heels failed to descend. 
The instructor and student pilot inside the Randolph-based T-37 were not injured, a m ilitary spokesman said. 
The spokesman said the twin-engine jet sustained only minimal damage after being forced to land on its belly at 
1:24 p.m. Cause of the wheel-meehan- ism failure is under investigation. 

 manent one after the streets dry. 
This, in turn, throws off the regular m ain ten an ce schedule because the crew s have to be pulled off for the temporary repairs. 
“ The ideal solution would he to overlay all of the streets with an inch of asphalt,” Granata said. But the cost* 

 would he too much except on a phased basis, he continued, noting that the cost of asphalt has soared in recent years. 

The city pays up to $13 a ton for as­ phalt delivered to the job site, a pro­ duct the city used to buy for $3.75 a ton.

A Cuban refugee who is a ve­ teran of the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion and a former CIA agent pleaded guilty Friday to falsely claiming U.S. citizenship, 

Chief U.S. Dist. Judge Adrian A. 
Spears sri a May 17 sentencing date for 
Nestor Izquierdo Diaz after a private conference in his chambers. 
Judge Spears initially sought to sen­ tence Izquierdo Friday on the charge, which carries a maximum penality of three years in prison and a $1,ooo fine. 
The judge sought information from 
U.S. M agistrate Joseph F. Leonard 
Jr.. defense attorney Roy Barrera and federal prosecutors in the case. 
The prosecutors said they wanted m ore time to determine if any addi­ tional information is turned up. 
Legal immigrant 
Izquierdo, a legally emigrated Cu­ ban national living in Miami, was a r­ rested March 22 at San Antonio Inter­ national Airport after he falsely iden­ tified himself as a Puerto Rican. 
He had arrived on a flight from 
Mexico City. 
He was jailed in lieu of a $25o,ooo bond. 
At a bond reduction hearing before 
Judge Leonard, Barrera said Izquierdo had formerly served with the CIA. 
Izquierdo was subsequently released on a $25,ooo bond. 
Ile told Judge Leonard he went to 
Mexico to visit friends. 
Visit shrine 
The Cuban later told reporters he had gone to Mexico City to visit the 
Shrine of Guadalupe. 
He said he had promised to make the pilgrimage after escaping alive from the Bay of Pigs in 1o61. 
But, he said, he traveled under the

Bullock is officially a candidate 

Slopping in San Antonio during a statewide swing of press conferences, 
Slate Comptroller Boh Bullock for­ mally announced Friday he is running for re-election. 
“ I enjoy what I'm doing,” Bullock said, although he admitted he would rather he governor. 
“ It's been my lifelong dream to he governor of Texas,” lie said. "It will take a hard fight to keep me from getting there eventually.” 
Briscoe 

One reason he said he is not seeking the sta te ’s highest office now' is the popularity of Gov. Dolph Briscoe and his good working relationship with 
Briscoe. 
“ I d m’t think I could add to what he is now doing,” Bullock said. 
Bullock said he rev italized the comptroller’s office when he took over 
2Vi years ago and listed as his top ac­ complishment the start of monehly 
.sales tax payments to cities, rather than quarterly payments. 
He also said his a u d ito rs were bringing in more taxes from out-of- state businesses which operate in Tex­ as, and that his office has doubled the numlier of minority employes. 
“ The people in the comptroller’s of­ fice are doing a better job than ever before,” Bullock said.

Judge orders inquest into 
W est death 

By VICKIE DAVIDSON 

Los Angeles County officials have ordered an inquest into the death of Sandra Hone West, th e wealthy widow' who wanted to he buried in a sports car in San 
Antonio. 
The purpose of the inquest is to de­ termine whether the March death of the attractive 37-year-old woman was an accident, a suicide or whether so­ meone killed her, F redrick Lacey, chief of the Los Angeles County In­ quest Division said Friday. 
“ We decided Thursday it was going 
In be inquested,” said Lacey. He said the inquest would probably be set for late May. 
The woman died March IO, hut Los 
Angeles County officials Friday had not determ ined the cause of death. 
They still had one toxicological test to run. 
Inheritance 
Meanwhile, it is still unsure when the woman will he buried or who will inherit her estimated $5 million estate. 
A Los Angeles sta te court judge ruled Monday the woman could he buried in her Ferrari. He based the ruling on testimony from friends and a 
1972 will. 
In that handwritten will Mrs. West said she wanted to he buried “ next to my husband in my lace nightgown by 
F’orter Loring (Mortuary) and in my 
F e r r a r i with the seat slan ted comfortably.” 
Her husband, Texas oilman Ike West is buried in the Alamo Masonic Ceme­ tery at North Pine and East Commerce streets. 
Mrs. West has been tem porarily buried in a San Antonio mausoleum. 
Wills differ 
The handwritten 1972 will leaves the hulk of her estate to brother-in-law Sol 
West HI of Comfort. A 1976 will, how­ ever, leaves most of her estate to San 
Antonio attorney Fred Semaan. 
Semaan, a West family attorney and friend, said a hearing on the w ills is set for June. 

Semaan and West contend their wills are valid. Mrs. W est’s m other says neither will is valid. 
Mrs. W'est owned three F e rra ris. 
The 1964 blue-green Ferrari Mrs. West wanted to he buried in is still im ­ pounded. 
Plea o f itinoeeni is refused 
A federal judge would not allow’ a 
Houston man to plead innocent to bookmaking charges Friday when the man would not admit he was the per­ son indicted. 
Among the nine people indicted by a federal grand jury here for allegedly participating in an illegal gambling business was Bob “ Last Name Unk­ nown.” 
F’BI agents later identified the man as Bobby Boyce English of Houston. 
But English and his attorney. Anth­ ony Nicholas, would not admit he was the man the FBI is looking for. 
So Chief U.S. Dist. Judge Adrian A. 
Spears told Asst. U.S. Atty. Thomas E. 
Riekhoff he would not allow the a r­ raignment to continue. 
Riekhoff told Judge Spears the case would probably be sent back to the grand jury. 
He said evidence of English’s alleged role in the bookmaking operation would be presented. 
FBI agents used a court-authorized wiretap to break the bookmaking ring which had w agers of m ore than 
$1oo,o9o in a single day last fall. 
Two of the people named in the indictment have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. 
Six others have pleaded innocent and are awaiting trial. 
Seven other people have already pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the bookmaking business. 
Two men received six-month prison sentences and were fined $1o,ooo

Lo-Ya<'u could help revive center city 

Downtown San Antonio, Inc., bas made a bold bid to upgrade 
Hit' heart of downtown, 

It bas offered to lease to Lo* 
Vaea (lathering Co. (when it has been spun off from Coastal 
States (ias Corp.) the Majestic 
Building for five years for the price of taxes, utilities, insur­ ance and normal upkeep of the building. 

Downtowners would retain the theater for renewal and re­ use, possibly as tile home of the 
San Antonio Symphony. 

The Majestic Building is a gift to the downtown group from the Mobil!/,olio Foundation. The building once housed a number of major law firms, a railroad headquarters and other busin­ esses. 

The theater, one of the hand­ somest In the Southwest, is quite adequate for most operas aud is acoustically very good. 
A major tenant in the build­ ing would make possible rede­ velopment for the symphony in tin' theater, An opening to the building and theater from 
Crockett St., at the back of the building, would enhance tin' 
Crockett St. side and make a shortcut to parking there. 

Another possibility is to con­ vert one or more buildings ad* lat ent It* the Majestic to parking 

 and, it necessary, to add more space for a new tenant. 
The offer to Lo*Vaea was made public by 
Downtown 
Chairman J. W. Frier after dir­ ectors voted to make the offer formal. 
Lo*Vaea is restrained from making commitments until the 
Coastal States tangle is settled by agreement or litigation. Op­ timism on the side of settlement has been dampened by some opposition by customers of the 
Lower Colorado River Authori­ ty. Corpus Christi and Austin haven’t agreed to the proposed settlement, either. 
Lo-Vaea has taken steps toward prudent planning, and that is as far as conditions allow, but planning to date has been in downtown San Antonio in an ex­ isting building. Lo-Vaea offi­ cials recognize their need to cultivate a new image that was soured by Coastal States. The 
Lo-Vaea team has separated it­ self from Coastal States and the top people are anxious to move to San Antonio and make a con­ structive corporate contribution to the community. 

But it is important to them that .San Antonians understand the company that will move here hasn’t been formed and organ­ ized. All of Lo-Vaca's moves are subject to an Austin district court.

President ( arter changed his strategy this week and aban­ doned the $ri(l tax rebate in favor of a tougher fight against infla­ tion. 
The time for a quick-flx economic stimulus had clearly passed The time had arrived lur attention to price increases running at an annual rate of ll per cenl * 
Instead of the economy sag­ ging, ll was developing new fever and Inflation was eating away earnings faster than toler­ able 
The President lias Shunned 
‘suggestions for price anil wag*' controls and bas said lie wants voluntary restraint, Bul lie ob­ viously doesn t expect (bal lo work, so bo will use talks with 

 the Federal Reserve Board, with business and labor leaders, and with what (lie President said will la* "moves by the Council on 
Wage and P rice Stability to provide more information on in­ flationary conditions un indivi­ dual markets and industries.” 
Those are legitimate moves and they let the free-enterprise concept work. Timely public in­ formation on prices and wages and clear definition of inflation­ ary factors should be useful and, perhaps, somewhat effective. 
Tlu* President’s goal is to cut inflation by 2 per cent within a year, Thai would be a signifi­ cant achievement Without it, 
American wage earners are be­ ing robbed al an intolerable pace,

“ Another en em ies list" (April 4), is — to parap hrase the late Winston Chur-^ chill — “ a piece of trivia wrapped in an*' overstatem en t inside a m isrep resen ta­ tio n ." 
On the other hand, there is nothing en ig m atic about the recent (M arch 21) ruling by the National News Council that for the second tim e in succession found our com plaint against J a c k An­ d e r s o n fo r 
“ u n f a ir n e s s and in a ccu ra cy " to he "fu lly w arran ted ." 
We now have had two governm ents 
— the United States and Costa R ica — form ally deny Anderson’s allegations concerning Nicaragua and two Nation­ al News Council d ecisio n s a g a in s t 
Anderson for unfair and in a ccu ra te reporting. 
Even Anderson, him self, was lorced to publicly retract (Sept. i i. 197(o an allegation against President Somoza. 
T h e c r e d ib ilit y p la ce d by th ird parties in A n d erson 's rep orting on 
Nicaragua would appear to have been eloquently stated. tan It. MacKenzie, 
Director,

Service 

H u m p h re y now can go all the way 

S ir ; O u r frie n d , H u b e rt H o ratio 
Humphrey, was originally from Huron, 
S D., but m ade his debut as a politician in Minneapolis, Minn. 
Me has on m any occassions poured forth words of wisdom — at least he believed in them. 
He ca m e forth with this statem ent 
( E x p r e s s - N e w s , 
A p ril 
3 ) a b o u t inflation which is very much in th - forefront at this time: " I c a m e from a com m ercial family (druggist in Hur­ on. S I) , sam e as a peanut fa rm er in 
Plains, (la., big business). When there is a surplus, lower prices. Hut what do we see? 
" T h e steel industry is running at tis per cent of capacity, so it raised its prices. 
It creates its own inflation. 
When the automobile industry sees the m arket dropping, it doesn't cut prices, it raises them (M arch was the largest month in years and m any em ployes went hack to w o rk )." 
My good friend R uble forgot one very important reference to another group who applied the sam e philoso­ phical reasoning. Our great Congress followed suit with a 23 lier cent in­ cre a se in sa la rie s to help stop the inflation. 
Why didn t you think about that, 
Senator? Not one word from any of you, because you fixed so it would pass regardless. Now aller the horse has been stolen, you lock the barn door. 
How stupid do you think your comdt* 
Iileitis are?

Mrs. C a r te r ’s press secretary will get

Sir: A jo k e ste r once answered the query "W h a t is tru th ?” with " A lie repeated often enough.”

Av enue to present-day media reporting that, true or not, which is repeated often enough is accepted by people as the truth. 

However, like the hole in the hose of the high-fashion model that shatters the illusion, an o ccasio n al in co n sis­ tency o ccu rs — and so with the San 
Antonio E x p ress of April l l. 

An A ssociated P r e s s a r tic le d a te ­ lined B elfast emphasized the conflict in Northern Ireland as a religious one 
— P ro testan t against Catholic. 

This has been the them e repeated over the years and som e have excused our local publishers believing them ignorant of the facts and at the m ercy of the wire services. 

However, in an editorial of the sa m e date on A m bassador Young, The E x ­ press rem inds us that the Irish dispute 
" i s at least 8oo years o ld ." G ranted! 

This identifies the basis of the dis­ pute a s political and as a reaction against foreign aggression. T h ere were no religious divisions at that tim e — nor for som e 35o years afterw ards! 

In adding the paint of later religious difference to the picture, and con si­ dering the religious affiliations of the contending parties, the news services and the E x p ress are doing P ro testan t­ ism an injustice in identifying it with foreign aggression through insisting on giving the conflict a religious base it does not possess. 

Reports on W atergate, governm ent 
“ s e x r e ta r ie s ," etc., have im pressed on ail of us the necessity of the "w a tc h ­ d o g " role of the press. 

H o w e v e r, w h e n , a s h e r e , a inew sp aper publishes news service re ­ leases containing “ fa c ts ” at variance with the truth as known to it, then I seriously question the integrity of such a publication.

WASHINGTON - Ever since the beginnings of democratic government, the representatives of the people in Parliament or 
Congress have puzzled over a fundamental philosophical question: 
W h eth er to vote for the sp ecial in­ terests of the people who elected them . or for the larg er interests of the nation. 
Most of the tim e — it is no big deal — the conflict of local, state and regional in terests usually produces a national co m p ro m ise or con sensus, w hich no­ body quite likes but everybody can tolerate. 
Once in a while, however, m e m b e rs of the Congress have to decide w hether they are a m b a ssa d o rs from their r e ­ gions or representatives of the nation, and P r e s id e n t C a r t e r ’s e n e r g y and tra d e p o lic ie s a r e now p u ttin g th is hard d ilem m a before every m e m b e r of the House and Senate. 
Illustration 
T he new D em o cra tic sen a to r from 
New Y ork , Daniel P atrick M oynihan, illustrates the point. 
He is the m ost engaging and a rticu ­ late of the new senators on Capitol Hill. 
When he was a professor at H arvard, a top official in the Labor D epartm ent and a m b a s s a d o r to In d ia an d th e 
United N atio n s in previous a d m in is ­ trations, he saw the world as a whole and was alm o st reck lessly honest in defining A m erica 's widest possible in­ terests. 
But now, a s senator from New Y ork , he is using all his considerable talents to argue for his own constituency, and he is a form idable advocate. 
Listen to him in Herald Square about the problem s of the garm en t industry of New Y o rk City. 
Apparel imports 

"L a s t y e a r, imports of apparel grew by 24 per cen t in quantity,’’ he said. 
“ In seven y ears, one job in three has been lost in the apparel industry of the city. 
" W e b e lie v e in in te rn a tio n a l fr e e trade. But there is a limit to what the w orkers of this city must endure in the nam e of a (fr e e trade) p rinciple few have heart o f.” 
But M oy n ih an know s b e t t e r th an most m e m b e rs of the Senate that the principle of free trade produces m ore exports and m ore jobs in this country as a whole than it loses through com petitive imports from abroad, but he is now doing, though he knows bet­ ter. what m o st senators do in defend­ ing their local, personal and political concerns. 
He h as obviou sly a g r ie v o u s local problem in the New Y ork g a r m e n t in­ dustry, but he is not putting it in p er­ sp e ctiv e . He is an e d u c a to r an d an historian by trad itio n , but he is not educating. He is d ram atizing the p ar­ ticular ra th er than explaining the g e n ­ eral problem of international trade. 
Threatening 

In fact. he is even threatening C arter on trade policy. " I send this friendly w a r n in g to th e 
( C a r t e r ) a d m in is t r a t io n ," he said in the g a r ­ ment d istrict this week. 
"G o out and get a good ag reem en t, a fa ir a g r e e m e n t . If you d o n ’t, d o n ’t com e back, and for sure, don’t com e back to the 
Senate 
F in a n ce 
C om ­ mittee, of which I am a m e m b e r ." 
This is im portant only as a symbol of the worst problem Carter is going to have to face when he presents his en ­ ergy, trade, disarm am ent and tax po­ licies to Congress. 

E very b o d y is for C a r te r ’s p o licies against w aste, pollution, p o rk -b a rrel water p rojects, tax ripoffs, and defense cutbacks until they hit the in terests of their local constituencies. 

Conservation 

Carter would like to believe ilia! the 
American people would conserve fuel, cut their speed on the highways and the heat iii their house* 
— after all. he has argued that they are 
" g o o d " coo p erativ e and c o m p a s sio n ­ ate people — but at the sam e tim e, he has drafted an energy p ro g ram that would tax b ig c a r s , put an up to 56 cent* a gallon tax on gasoline over the next few y ea rs, aud invest iii the deve­ lopment of nuclear aud solar energy. 

A* a n a tio n a l policy, tin * u n d o u b ­ ted ly m a k e s a lot of s e n s e , but it w orries the auto m a n u fa c tu re r* , the auto m u o n *, the en viron m en talists, aud many others who fear atom ic a c ­ c id e n t s a m i w a s te * — an d m o st members of Congress are voting their political fears. 

This a v ery obi p rob lem al d e m o ­ cracy, a* Hat Moynihan knows better than almost any other mem ber of the bellite.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday April 16 I977 
H 

W innie is a fine cam paigner 

Several nights a week during the campaign heat, 
Winnie 
Vetter would leave her two chil­ dren with her husband, relatives or sitters. 

Then she’d pack her jingle-jangle nerves off to some neighborhood church or community center to give a variation of her spiel on roads, parks and growth plans. 

The 24-year-old woman was campaigning for the 
District 8 City Council spot. 

She’d never run for anything before. She was running against five men 
— including two incum­ bent councilmen. 
She wasn’t accepting any donations and she wasn’t spending more than chicken feed on the race. 
But, Winnie Vetter really wanted to win. 
“ I got my utility bill a 

Saturday 

 couple of months ago and 
I decided I could do a better job,” she says ex­ plaining her entrance in­ to the campaign. 

Authority 

When she gave her speeches, she spoke with the authority and ease of someone older. But on the day of the interview she’s more informal and with her loose shoulder- length hair she could pass for a college stu­ dent. 

“ If anyone wanted to run for office — like if you did, I d say do it. It’s unlike any other exper­ ience,” she says. 

“ It was exciting when I found people in the crowd who understood the issues I talked about and 
I thought they’d go out and work for them. 

“ I was just a telephone operator. But, I could get out and express an opin­ ion and people listened.” 

But did she expect to win? “ No.” 

The two children 
Winnie had to leave when she was campaigning are loudly competing for her attention the afternoon of the interview. 
Day care center 

“ Careful, Bryce,” she warns as the 3-year-old tumbles on the floor 
“ I would have put them 

7 got my utility bill a couple of months ago and I decided I could do a better jo b 9 

 in a day-care center if I’d been elected,” she said. 
“ I would have looked ar-' ound for a good one.” 
Winnie Vetter netted only 1.3 per cent of the vote, but the young wo­ man gave some of the best delivered campaign speeches among District 
8 contenders. 
To the pleasure of a 
North 
San 
Antonio 
Chamber of Commerce crowd, she once articula­ tely cracked white, anglo men should get a fair shake in employment, practices. 
“ It ’s just not fair now.” 

She meant it. And she had a plan for establish­ ing a city hiring practice to eliminate all discri­ mination. 
Winnie left the chamber of commerce crowd — and most other crowds — laughing with her humorous, “ May the best woman win,” deli­ vered spiritedly at the end of her speech. 
But, she doesn’t attri­ bute her whip-crackin’ delivery to spirit or spunk. “ I'm shy with people I know. But, strangers — I can talk to more openly,” she explains.

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - Ambassador Andrew 
Young was embroiled in another flap Fri­ day as the State Department disputed his remark denying the legitimacy of the South 
African government — and South African authorities demanded clarification. 
Young, the U.S. am­ bassador to the United 
Nations, responded 
“ yeah” when asked in an interview with The As­ sociated Press whether he thought the South 
African government was illegitimate. 
Secretary of State Cy­ rus R. Vance called 
Young to inform him that he had misrepresented 
American policy. How­ ever, a Vance spokesman said Young was not re­ primanded. 
“ Although we do not agree with a number of policies and practices of 
South Africa, it is incor­ rect to say that the government of South 
Africa is illegitimate,” 
State Department spo­ kesman nodding Carter told reporters. 
In New York, a spo­ kesman for the U.S. Mis­ sion to the United Na­ tions said Young was 
“ aware that the State 
Department was going to make that statement.” 
Young was out of the of­ fice and could not be reached. 
In Cape Town, South 
African Foreign Minister 
R. F. Rotha called in U.S. 
Ambassador 
W illiam 
Rowdier and asked him whether Young’s remark had been reported accur­ ately. 
Rotha would not say how seriously his government viewed the remark. 
Own policy 
“ I must wait for an of­ ficial intimation from the 
United States govern­ ment as to whether this was actually said by Mr. 
Young,” Botha said. 
Carter told reporters the 

ANDREW YOUNG 
. . . controversial 
United States would in­ form South Africa that 
Young's comment did not reflect official policy. 
After his news confer­ ence Friday, President 
Carter told reporters: 
“ I ’ve never asked members of the Cabinet to restrain themselves in their public statements. 
One example has been 
Andy Young. I ’ve never complained about what 
Andv does. 
“ There has been cri­ ticism from other sources,” Carter said. “ I think we have a fairly open administration, and 
I think it’s good for us to let the debates be ex­ tended outside the Con­ gress and the White 
House into the public domain.” 
In the interview' with 
AP reporters William 
Oatis and Samuel Roo, 
Young said transfer to majority rule in South 
Africa is a “ process that ntx*ds to begin immedia­ tely.”

Am bassador nomination is opposed 

DEL RIO (A P) - Sen. John Tower, K-Tex., said 
Friday that the U.S. ambassador to Mexico should be a Mexicun-American and that he opposes nomin­ ation of Wisconsin Gov, Patrick Lueey to that post. 
“ He doesn’t even speak Spanish,” Tower said of 
Lueey. 
Meanwhile, a Mexico City newspaper also ques­ tioned the nomination because of hts reported statement that he is unfamiliar with the "bracero,” or migrant farm worker problem. 
Lueey'* appointment by President Carter is awaiting ratification by the Senate. 
Vhe conservative morning daily El Heraldo said: 
“ When one knows that the next ambassador doesn’t know anything about a problem which is so lacerat­ ing for us, as well as being a considerable one-for his own country, such as the braceros, one falls into thinking that the designation of this diplomat was taken a little hastily.” 
In a telephone interview earlier this week with the 
San Diego Evening Tribune, Lueey was asked whether there were plans for a new U.S.-Mexican 
“ bracero” treaty allowing Mexicans to legally work 

 iii the United States. A “ bracero” is a Mexican farm laborer who works in the Untied States 
“ A new what?" Lueey was quoted responding. 
(Questioned further, he reportedly replied, " i ’m not familiar with that. What is it?" 

If the “ best woman” couldn’t win the District 
8 council race, Winnie says it’s a good thing the best man — Phil Pyndus 
— did. 
“ f have a lot of respect for him.” Besides, she says, Phil was good en­ ough to give her a few campaigning tips. 
Tips W innie Vetter will probably need. 
The young woman has politi­ cal ambitions. Maybe mayor. Maybe governor. 
She admits there’s still a lot to learn before her climb to the stars. 
“ One major weakness I have is no degree ... I ’ve been accepted at Trinity 
University, but we just 

 can’t afford it yet. 
Winnie has already been through a good deal of college material. When she was working to put her husband, Lewis, through college, she also read all of his books and studies with him. 
She still reads all the time, she says. 
Newspapers, mysteries, everything — “ I read some of Lewis’s com­ puter books to under­ stand what he’s doing. 
She also says she needs to understand more about politicking so she’ll be working on more campaigns — for other people and for herself. 
" I knocked on a lot of doors during the cam­ paign. I’ll be knocking on those doors again.” 
Her face grows serious. 
“ Someday I really might run for governor. I’ve al­ ways loved Texas and 
I ve always been proud of it.” 
“ Probably bv the time 
I ’m 5o, I’ll try it."

Briscoe has stated he thought teacher pay raises should he given on a local basis in view of the state’s pick­ ing up more of the school foundation program tab. 
The teacher pay bill voted out of 
M assey’s com m ittee e a rlie r in the week would give $263 million in salary increases state-wide. 
“ Mow do things look for passage of the new bills — particularly the man­ dated property tax cut?” Massey was asked. 
“ Well, anytime an issue must stand on its own there’s a certain vulnerabi­ lity,” Massey said. 
“ As part of HB75o, each of these was afforded a certain protection sort of a safety in numbers factor. That’s gone now.” he said. 
Property tax relief, which will now have to be debated all over again, had through by a narrow m argin before 
Bryant’s point of order shot the bill down. 
Now debate will have to be repeated. 
The e n tire Bexar County Mouse delegation had voted against the man­ datory' tax cut provision of HB75o. 
It was the consensus am ong the 
Bexar delegates the issue of tax cuts should be a local option, sharing the view of Briscoe.

 want lo give a fax cut, fine. If they want m use the money for other pur­ poses, so be it. 
In other words, they opposed state dictating to local d istricts how the money should be spent. 
On the other hand, supporters of the m andated tax cut said it kepi faith with the voters who had been promised tax relief by the 65th Legislature when it convened Jan. ll. 
With the weekend to mull it over, and maybe several days more. there is ample time for opponents of the man­ dated tax cut to muster their forces anew. 
Since the amendment to drop the tax cut . mandate was only defeated 74-66. and with a second crack as it coming, some feel the tax relief issue may be in big trouble. 

Big districts 

One m ajor aspect of all this is the fact anti HE575o forces accomplished their goal. They have stalled the bill they believe is nothing more than a committee compromise with the big school districts. 
It has given them time for a little arm twisting and wheeling and dealing in an effort to get their amendments on the bill. 
It also gives them a bargaining point to work from in getting a teacher pay bill through despite an already glaring lack of funds kept in the coffers. 

Continued from r a g e 1A home court advantage. 
“ Yeah, the home court edge might have made a difference," said Kenon. 
“ I think it would have.” 
“ Maybe,” said Gale. “ If we have that momentum, instead of a slump, no telling what would’ve happened.” 
“ One thing we had against us was that we played poorly at tho end of the season,” said Paultz. “ We never could get the momentum back.” 
There were no tears in the dressing room. Just dejection. 
“ We did much better this season than anybody thought we would,” said 
Gervin. “ We surprised a lot of people 

 by making the playoffs. 
“ I am not dissatisfied with the year but I'm not really impressed, either. I think we could’ve won 5o or 6o games 
(Spurs finished 44-38). 
“ But we proved something.” insist - cd Gervin. “ We will be back next year. 
We are here to stay. I’m guaranteeing it.” 
The m en in the restroom again agreed.

Me added, “ the labor movement be­ lieves one of the major problems is mass unemployment,” as well as in­ flation, and said if reserved judgment of the rest of the President's message until it could study it in detaile. 

Later, at a briefing, Secretary of the 
Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal said in appealing for the cooperation of both labor and business, “ It really is a los­ ing gam e to try to get ahead of the wage-price spiral.” Me added, “ In the end, everybody loses.” 
In his wide ranging news session 
Carter also said: 
* Mr does not regard the strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet 
Union at an impasse and he hopes to meet with Communist party leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev on a continuing basis. 
• The Central Intelligence Agency 

 has just finished a thorough analysis of world oil and natural gas reserves and found present estimates to be substan­ tially o v erstated . Me term ed this 
“ quite disturbing.” 
• The President completed his work 
Friday morning on the controversial issue of killing or slowing numerous water projects and said he would be notifying congressional leaders and the affected governors of his decisions over the weekend. 
At the briefing conducted by Blu­ m enthal and C harles L. Schultze, chairman of the President’s Council of 
Economic Advisers, Schultze disclosed that while the proposal was not finally set. he understood it would have man­ datory aspects. 
Me said the plan “ limits the rate of revenue increase” that hospitals could obtain, apparently leaving them free to price specific services any way they wanted but limiting their aggregate revenues to a so far undeterm ined percentage increase. 
VOTE 

Monfrey will appear on the ballots in all IO districts. 
In addition to the mayoral candi­ dates’ listing, these candidates will be pitted against each other in these dis­ tricts in the Saturday runoffs: 
District 2 — Joe Webb and Charles 
E. Williams Sr. 
District 3 — Bob Billa and Helen 
Du t mer. 
D istrict 4 — F rank D. Wing and 
Johnny Mata. 
District 5 — Bernardo Eureste and 
Dario Chapa. 
District 6 — Rudy C. Ortiz and Bob 
Thompson. 
District 7 — Richard Teniente and 
Joe Alderete Jr. 
While the runoff contests for the district spots on the council have been intense, the race for mayor has do­ minated the scene in the runoffs, as it did in the April 2 election. 

Maylor Lila Cockrell has m ade a spirited defense of her administration, and leads Monfrey into the runoff on the basis of her 43,947 to 35,o46 vote margin over Monfrey in the April 2 election. 
Rematch 

The battle is a rematch of the 1975 runoff battle between the sam e two contestants. In the 1975 go, Mrs. Cock­ rell defeated Monfrey by 55,439 to 
47.287. 

There is a potential vote of 329,577, and the April 2 vote came in at 34.5 of the potential. 

Two years ago the runoff vote ex­ ceeded the vote cast in the first city election that year. 
In that election, however, there were seven runoff races and all 14 candi­ dates were running citywide and listed on all the ballots.

SATURDAY 
12-HOUR 
CARPET 

WASHINGTON (AP) 
— President Carter has approved continued fed­ eral spending for two giant projects on the list of dams and waterways he had considered scrap­ ping, while recommend- • ing that the government end financing of many others. 
Texas was not im m e­ diately involved in his about-face decisions. 
The word went out 
Friday night that some of the 3o pro jects on his so-called hit list now have his support. 
But it went out piecemeal, as the White 
House advised governors and m em bers of Con­ gress from the states in­ volved and they, in turn, disclosed the a d m in is­ tration verdicts. 
Of the first 2o deci­ sions disclosed. 
Carter- proposed no funds for nine projects, full fund­ ing for six, partial fund­ ing for three and w ith­ held decisions on two pending further study. 
Carter’s decisions are budget recommendations and are subject to action by 
Congress, w here m any m e m b e rs have pledged to protect projects in their states. 
The President told a 

 neu?s conference Friday that he had finished work on the water projects and would formally announce his decisions on Monday. 
He said his aides were preparing an analysis of the reasons for his deci­ sions, to he made public at the same time. 
“ We have tried to do this in a very careful and methodical way,’’ Carter said. “ Combined with it, we will publish and ad­ here to a very strict list of criteria in the future for approval of projects.’’ 
Those more stringent rules on environmental standards and economic benefits of proposed projects will m ake it more difficult for spon­ sors to get sta rte d on projects still on the drawing boards. 
The pro jects on the 
Carter list already are under construction. 

Carter agreed to con­ tinue financing of the huge Tennessee-Tombig- bee 
W aterw ay, in 
A labam a, M ississippi and 
T ennessee. 
The 
253-mile barge w a te r­ way, which carries a $18 billion total price tag, would link the Tennessee 
River with the Gulf of 
Mexico at Mobile, Ala. 
Starr charges eyed 

AUSTIN 
(AP) — Law' enforcement officers may be making some headway in their war against dope dealers along the Rio Grande, said Atty. Gen. 
John Hill. 
A “ considerable number’’ of indictments will be returned by the Starr County grand jury in the near future, Hill predicted Friday. 
“ There has been a lot of solid work going on down there the last few months,” Hill said in commenting on the efforts of his men in cooperation with federal drug agents and local authorities. 
Starr County is a stronghold of drug traffickers, according to a January grand jury report.

T ro p h y w in n er 
J o h n 
C a p p e lle tti a n d h is y o u n g e r b ro th e r J o e y , who had le u k e m ia , topped it in viewers. The w eek befo re, it w as 
ABC’S “ L av e rn e an d 
Shirley.” 
At a luncheon in New 
York with British acto r 
R o b e rt 
P ow ell, who played .Jesus, Italian di­ rector Franco Zeffirelli, p ro d u c e r 
V in cen zo 
Labella, and Lord Lew tirade, the one man m ost responsible for the whole p ro d u ctio n , w ere p r e ­ sent. 
Lord Lew co m m en ted during the press confer­ en ce th a t “ th is is th e crowning event of my 51 years in the business.” 
When ask ed how th e project cam e about, he said it was really nothing spectacular. “ I was hav­ ing d in n e r w ith s o m e friends,” Grade related, 
“ and so m eo n e a s k e d w h at I w ould do n e x t. 
O ne sa id ‘How a b o u t 
Jesu s?’ I said ‘You have a deal.’ This is really how it cam e about.” 
By the tim e Lord Lew had finished the project of “ Jesus of N azareth,” it had cost $18 m illion. 
“ The budget went out of hand of our choosing,” he said. He w anted m a jo r stars for the roles and to get them it costs money. 
And m ajor sta rs he got for the film. 

It was also pointed out at the luncheon that s e ­ ven or e ig h t d if fe r e n t endings of the re s u rre c ­ tion were made. Then it was hard to decide whic h one to use. 

Z effirelli sa id m o r e than ten hours was m ade and it had to be trim m ed to what you saw on tele- v ision. There was no way it could all be used in the tim e alloted by NBC pro­ g r a m m e r s for the p r o ­ ject. 
When q u e s tio n e d , 
Powell, who played th e role of Je su s s u p e rb ly , said, “ To be absolutely honest, I am not sure vet 

 how I feel about playing the role. I think it will be some months before I can separate things. Some of the r e p o r ts th a t have been published have been wishful th in k in g . As of yet, I haven’t sorted it all out. The a m o u n t of r e ­ search I had lo do for the role gave m e a tre m e n ­ dous feeling. It is a pro­ found re s p o n s ib ility to play Christ. I realize that responsibility." 
Powell w as born in 
S alfo rd , 
L a n c a s h ire , 
June I, 1944, the son of a mechanical engineer. He says his interest in acting began when, as a boy, he played s m a ll p a r t s in 
BBC ra d io p r o g r a m s b ro a d c a s t fro m M an ­ chester. He now m akes his home in London.

The suit claim s conditions in the local jail violate federal law by deny­ ing rights due all prisoners, not just the two lodging the charges. 
C om m issioners Court was served 
Wednesday with notice of the case brought by Robert M. Bowden and 
Mark A. Herbold. 
Herbold is still in jail but Bowden was released when the burglary charge against him w as dropped, his attorney, 
Miles H. Appleberry, explained. 
Charges of allowing im proper condi­ tions to continue were levelled at 
Judge Blair Reeves and other Com­ missioners Court m em bers — Coms. 
A. J. Ploeh. Albert Bustam ante, Tom 
Stolhandske and J e f f W entw orth, 
Sheriff W. B. “ B ill” Hauck and Jail 
Administrator Ray Olivarri. 
The petition c la im s Bowden and 
Herbold were both bitten by a rat while 

 asleep in a jail cell during the earlv m orning hours of Feb. 26. 
Both ultimately received treatment for the bites but only after som e delay, the petition says. According to the d o cu m en t, two oth er p riso n e rs witnessed the rat bit incident. 
Herbold also claim s a loss of hearing resulted after being attacked and bea­ ten by other prisoners during a jail stay as a federal pre-trial prisoner a year earlier. 
Both men claim the rat bite incident is an exam ple of the im proper living conditions that have harm ed them and all other prisoners in the jail. 
The jail, they say, is infested with verm in and professional exterm inators are not used. According to the suit, rat and roach poison and m ouse traps are sporadically used by untrained jail personnel instead. 
D am ages sought, in addition to an injunction and corrective m easures, are $5oo,oooo by Bowden and $7oo,ooo by Herbold.

A file of people passes through a narrow corridor — lined with “ popcorn” and “ coral” — in the Caverns of Sonora. Ahead of them lies room after room of nature’s wonders — wonders built in 6o million years of water acting on the limestone rock of the Edwards plateau. And nature is still at work — much of the cave is “ live.”

SATURDAY SIZZLER 
Try your hand at “barrel craft”! 

Working for several million years, Nature created this wonderful work of art. It is a butterfly on a wall deep in the Caverns of Sonora. The wings are pure white and transparent calcite crystal. They are joined by the butterfly’s body of a slightly darker crystal. Each wing is a little larger than an adult's hand. 

Genuine Kentucky Whiskey barrels— use one or two and let your imagination be your guide. 

You can make any of the unique and distinctive items shown below plus many more. Use as decorator tubs to brighten up any area. Their attractive styling makes them a welcome addition to modern or traditional settings. Each barrel holds 52 gallon barrels, 36” high, 28” diameter and I inch thick, solid white oak. 

Special buy.

A cave is nature’s Astro­ dome. 
You can plan a trip to a cavern and know the trip can be made. 
No visit underground has to be called off on account of rain , cold or even 
“ wind warnings on area lakes.” 
Bonnie and I had an example of this a couple of weekends ago. 
We had planned to go that Saturday to the upper Gulf Coast for an outdoor story. But Friday was chilly, gray and rainy in San Antonio. The forecast was the drizzly weather would move east to the area we were to visit. 
So instead of going east, we headed west to a place we had long wanted to visit. We knew the weather would not ham per Bonnie's pictures. 
We knew exactly what the weather would be. 
For we were going to the Caverns of 

Sonora and we knew the tem perature down in the cavern would be exactly 7o degrees. 
It’s always 7o in the Sonora Caverns. 
Of course it has taken nature much longer to build the Caverns of Sonora than for man to build the Astrodome. 
The Astrodome was built in a little m ore than two years. 
But at the Caverns of Sonora, the u n d erg ro u n d lim esto n e sta rte d dissolving back in the Mesozoic period, when dinosaurs roamed the earth. As the limestone dissolved, it left cracks, tu n n els, passagew ays, ch asm s and cham bers — great and sm all. 
That start was fit) million years ago. 
And the Caverns of Sonora are not finished yet. 
M uch of the cave is still “ liv e.” 
W ater is still trick lin g through the rocks and carrying the m ineral parti­ cles that form stalactites, stalagm ites 

 and all the formations that make the 
Caverns of Sonora such a m arvelous spectacle. 
N ature moves slowly but with cer­ tainty. 
Deep in the cave Gordon Meesling, our guide, pointed to a stalactite com­ ing from the ceiling and a stalagm ite rising from the floor. 
They w ere so close to m eeting — point to point — it seemed a thick sheet of paper could not be passed between them. 
“ T hey p ro b ab ly w ill join in IOO years,” Gordon said. 
“ A lot of factors such as the amount of water flowing through the rocks, the acid content of the water, the amount of m ineral picked up and the humidity determ ines the rate of growth. . 
“ But on an average it takes 1o.ooo years for a formation to grow an inch in length and IOO,OOI) years for its ra­ 

 dius to grow an inch. 
And we could not help w ondering how long it had taken for nature to form the most beautiful single object 
Bonnie and I have seen in any cave. 
It is a transparent white and light cream butterfly — each wing as large as a hand — looking as though it had just landed on the cave wall. 
It takes no imagination to see it as a butterfly. 
Sonora is 175 miles west of San An­ tonio. The caverns are a few miles off 
IBIO a few miles west of the town. 
IH1o goes through the heart of the 
Mill Country to Kerrville and .Junction and then into the high country atop the 
Edwards Plateau. From San Antonio to Sonora is one of the most beautiful drives in the state. 
With an early start it is possible to visit the caverns on a one-day trip. The guided tour of the caverns takes about an hour and a half. 
Pretty campground 
But for cam pers there is a pretty campground. The cave entrance is in a grassy cup surrounded by hills dotted with cedar and live and shin oak. 
The cave is on the Mayfield Ranch and a group headed by Stanley May­ field owns and operates the cave. 
“ The cave was discovered about 
19oo,” Mayfield told us. ‘‘There were a lot of mountain lions and wolves here then. 
“ The ranch had a pack of hounds. 
One day they were about to catch a wolf and he darted behind a big rock and down into a hole. At least one hound went down in the hole after him. 
“ The story is that the people with the hounds rolled the rock away and got the hound out — and discovered the cave.” 
“ For m any years few people went down into it,” Jam es E. M orris, the cave m anager, told us, 
“ Not too far from the entrance was a great hole — known as ‘The P it.’ 
“ No way was found to get across it."

G eo rg e (Earm ark 

 by 
Bonnie Carmaek 

But in 1955>the Dallas Grotto of the 
National Speleological Society heard of the cave and a group of four cave ex­ perts started exploring it. 
As Gordon guided Bonnie and me along the passageway a few hundred yards from the entrance, he pointed to a ragged hole leading down from the side of today’s path. 
The en tran ce to the hole is little larger than a m an ’s body and even with the lig h ts from to day’s p a s­ sageway, it was hard to see much ’ore than a foot down the hole. 
It is hard to see how anyone had the nerve to start crawling down it. But the 
Dallas S pelunkers did. That tunnel­ like passageway is no longer used. To­ day’s lighted and smooth path goes around the left end of ‘The Pit.’ 
The Pit is something to see! 
Discovery 
Having skirted The Pit, we stood on the far side and looked down into the chasm. The rock walls went straight down. And an overhang at the top would have m ade it even harder to 

 climb up or down. It was 5o or 55 feet down U> the tum bled rocks on the floor. 
Gordon flashed his light across The 
Pit to a rough ledge. Behind the ledge was another rock wall with a jagged opening. 
“ This is the other end of the passage through w hich the D allas gro u p crawled,” Gordon said. 
Then cam e a d ra m a tic m om ent. 
Gordon slowly swept the flashlight’s beam around the top of one end of The 
Pit. 
“ That’s where Jack Prince, leader of the Dallas group, crawled — inching his way around the top,” Gordon said. 
“ As he crossed, he laid a safety rope and the others followed him .” 
W hat P rin ce, Jack A llen, Claude 
Head and Bob Littlefield found beyond 
The Pit was a wonderland. 
Under conditions far different from these adventurers — wearing their lit­ tle carbide m iners’ lamps — Bonnie and I saw that sam e wonderland under skillfully placed electric lights. 
‘Live’ 
Beyond The Pit is the “ live” part of the cave. W ater — carrying the sm al­ lest imaginable amount of calcium or tra c e of m in e ra ls — s till filte rs through the limestone rock as it has for millions of years. 
It is a cave of many colors — tran­ sparent crystal, pure white, cream , soft greens or blues, shades of some orange and red and almost black. 
But it is the formations themselves 
— literally millions of them — stalac­ tites, stalagm ites —columns, drapery, soda straw s as long as four feet, calcite crystals by the millions that look just like popcorn, formations that resem ble the coral of the sea. 
They range in size from tiny white hairs no larg er than the needles of hoarfrost on a limb in winter to great cones almost as big as an old-fashioned haystack. 
But Sonora Caverns is proudest of its

By SARA MARTINEZ 

San 
Antonio and 
Uvalde must resolve dif­ ferences concerning Ed- w ards a q u ife r w ater quality and usage, the executive director of the 
Nueces River Authority said Friday. 
“ The Edwards aquifer is our so le s o u rce of water just as it is yours. 
And it is our drinking water before it gets to you,” retired Maj. Gen. 
John VV. White said. 
Gen. White presented 
“ A View from the West 
End of the Aquifer” at the Conopus Club regular meeting at the San An­ tonio Country Club. 
“ The Edwards aquifer is not just one pool of water,” Gen. White said. 
“ It underlies three river basins. The upper basins of the Nueces, San An­ tonio and 
G u ad alu p e rivers provide input to the aquifer.” 
One order 
Gen. W hite said the 
San Antonio position on w a te r q u a lity is th e re should be one order for the entire area served by the aquifer. 
“ San 
A n tonians consider the aquifer as one big body of w ater. 
They think it is a region­ al p ro blem with a r e ­ g io n al s o lu tio n ,” Gen. 
White said. 
“ But in U vald e, the po sition is that th e re should be s e p a ra te o rd e rs . Conditions a re not the s a m e in each county so there is no need 

 to impose the sam e re ­ gulations on all areas.” 
The primary difference in conditions is the popu­ lation n u m b e r, 
Gen. 
White said. 
“ People are the cause of pollution and the po­ pulation growth in Bexar 
County is c a u s in g the problem in water quali­ ty,” Gen. White said. 
"Uvalde (County) is a rural area and it does not need the sam e rigid ur­ ban growth controls Bex­ ar County does,” he said. 
Major problem 
“ Uvalde’s m ajor prob­ lem has been the co n ­ struction of hom es and septic tanks on the banks of the r i v e r s , ” 
Gen. 
White said. “ The single order did not deal with this hut separate orders do.” 
“ Separate orders will work because each coun­ ty has a self-interest that it works. We all want to p ro tect our w ater source.” 
“ We are in a period of plenty rig h t now. But h is to r ic a lly , we are hound to come to another drought. 
“ There is no doubt we will need surface water. 
The question is how and who is going to pay for it.” 

Positions 
Gen. W hite said this q uestion also brou ght different positions from 
San Antonio and Uvalde. 
“ San Antonio believes all who use the Edwards aquifer will benefit from 

 the im portation of siir- 
White said. is creating the shortage face water so all should 
“ But in U v ald e, the un1! th e r e fo r e should share in the cost,” Gen. thought is Bexar County bear the cost.

COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES 
PARIS - The United 
States and Vietnam will open discussions here 
May 3 on the possibility of normalizing diploma­ tic relations, the State

Vietnam war.

Ethop ia gets 
Russian arm s 

ADDIS ABABA - The 
Soviet Union has begun shipping tanks and other heavy arms to Ethiopia under a secret military assistance agreement, according to Arab and 
Western diplomatic sources here. 

The aid could amount to more than $1oo million in military equipment, the sources said. 

The arrival of Soviet arms in Ethiopia marks the end of an era st retelling back more than 2o years during which the United States exclusively provided vir­ tually all of the former pro-Western nation’s mi­ litary needs.

Seven guilty in gang rape 

ROME — A Rome court has found seven youths guilty in the gang rape of an 18-year-old girl who defied tradition and demanded a public trial — only the second time in Italian history a rape trial was not held behind closed doors. 
The victim. Claudia 
Caput!, had won the sup­ port of thousands of Ita­ lian feminists in her fight to bring her attackers to public justice. The seven 
— among some 2o young hoodlums Miss Capuli claimed attacked her — drew terms of from two and one-ha lf to four years.

I FTA gets tough about violence 

CHICAGO (AP) - In a plea for nonviolent television programming, the 
National 
Parent-Teaeher Associa­ tion announced a nation­ wide mail campaign 
Friday aimed at TV networks, local stations and prime time adver­ tisers. 
, 
If the letter campaign by its million 
» members does not reduce 
J the amount of 
TV 
• violence by Jan. I, the 
PT A will consider boycotts of advertisers’ products and of certain programs and possible court action, said W il­ liam M. Young, PT A project director. 
Letters 
The letter project — called the First Action 
Plan — was an outgrow th of eight hearings the 
PTA held across the na­ tion on TV violence. It officially will get under way July I and will in­ clude a nationwide pro­ gram to train parents on how to monitor TV pro­ grams and how to most 
“ efficiently and effectively” commun­ icate their program de­ sires to the networks, said Carol Klmmel, na­ tional PTA president. 
The PTA believes that violence on TV is exag­ gerated and contributes to a paranoia among ci­ tizens that actual violence on the streets is worse than it really is, 
Young said. 
“ We don’t think that people can watch 

 mayhem, rape and murder night after 8ight, week after week without affecting the quality of life in America,” said 
Young. 
The current target of the PTA is “ gratuitous violence,” which the as­ sociation- defines as violence put into pro­ grams solely to inject action in TV shows, said 
Mrs. Kimmel. 

Sports 

 epending on the suc­ cess of the current cru­ sade, however, the PTA may expand its efforts in the future to include violence in sports and violence shown on daily news shows, said Young. 
He said the PTA will release a report in July that will show television violence contributes to aggressive behavior among youths; that some youths are incited to imitate violent acts they see on TV; that there is a growing desensitization among youths and adults because of the violence on TV; and that the per­ ception of peaceful prob­ lem-solving methods in everyday life — such as discussion, negotiation and compromise — are 

 greatly distorted by the prevalance of violent acts on TV. 
The average child now watches six to 6V2 hours of television a day and preschool children watch 
25 hours of television a week, said Mrs. Kimmel. 
Monitor 

In its initial program, the PTA will teach par­ ents how to monitor pro­ grams, how to particpate in the petitioning process to the Federal Commu­ nications Commission for denying broadcast license renewals to local 
TV stations and the process in which local stations are required to obtain community feed­ back on the ways in which the station may best serve the public in­ terest. 
National workshops will be held in 12 loca­ tions at which four to six 
PTA representatives from each state attend­ ing. 
These state reperesen- tatives will then return and teach the same methods to local chapters, hopefully reaching the 
P T A ’s 
33,ooo local units around the nation.

 helictites. These are clear crystal formations that grow out horizontally 
— straight out from a wall or from another formation. 
Sometimes they twist and turn. And some — also about the size of a soda straw — start out from a wall, curve and after tens of thousands of years grow back to the wall. 
Gordon told us only IO per cent of the world’s caves have helictites and Son­ ora Caverns has more than all the other caves of the U.S. combined. 
But a lot of that is for the cave ex­ perts. To get the most from a trip to a cave, see it through the believing eyes of your childhood.

1 toad. 
Hungry? 

See a string of popcorn — a great strip of streaked bacon — a muffin with a large knife just at the point of cutting into it. 
Come with us as Gordon guided us through the cave. Names given places on the trail — plus your imagination will tell you what we saw. 
Just beyond The Pit was the Totem 
Pole — and then the Sponge Room, with hundreds of geodes — which are hollow formations about the size, usually, of two doubled fists — lining the walls and ceiling. 
Then came the Valley of Ice, with hoarfrost crystals everywhere — and the Palace of Angels, with one long formation from ceiling to floor like a twisted silver ribbon. 
We looked up a long, lighted corridor that rose from the trail. 
“ Why that’s a desert scene," I said, 
“ with white sand and cactus and white desert weeds.” 
“ People from the Southwest usually see it as a desert.” Gordon said. 
“ Those from the North see it as a w inter scene, a field and trees covered with snow.” 
Down the passageway a big cone — 
Red Top — rose from the floor. For millions of,vears the water feeding it had run through rocks leaving a white or brownish deposit. Then in more re-

About seven miles of the eave have been mapped. The lighted trail now covers about one mile. 

Stanley Mayfield, head of the group of owners, reports extension of the trail is being considered. 

“ There are some wonders deeper in the cave,” Mayfield said. “ There is a room we call the ‘Hall of 
Giants.* And there is a sizeable lake. 

“ Several years ago the national 
Miss Wool and a group of girls were brought into the cave. A movie was made of them swimming in this lake.” 

 cent millions of years, the water had run through an iron deposit, giving the cone a red cap. 
Then came the Corinthian Room, with its two great draped pillows — and the Pagoda. 
Then came Moon Milk Fulls. It was like a stream of thick, pure white paint, three or four feet wide and se­ veral inches deep, falling over ledges like a waterfall. 
“ Long ago, Indians and other primi­ tive peoples used moon milk from caves to stop bleeding,” Gordon said. 

Jonah’s Trail 

On they came —the Ice Cream 
Sundae — the Baby Grand Canyon — and the Crystal Palace. There a crys­ tal-clear formation looking exactly like twin fish tails grew out of the wall — of great beauty. 
Finally the passageway was a long section of fleshy white — like a big, winding tube. 
As we neared its end and the exit from the cave, Gordon said: 
“ This is Jonah's Trail through the 
Belly of the Whale.” 
And as- he opened the door and stepped into the bright Texas sunlight 
— ours was some of the wonderment of 
Jonah at what we had seen.

Davis plans m otion on bond 

FORT WORTH (AP) — Defense at­ torneys for Fort Worth millionaire 
Cullen David said Friday they will file a new motion Monday to have Davis released on bond. 
Meanwhile, officials revealed that an anonymous phone call led to the de­ claration of a mistrial in Davis’ capital murder trial Wednesday. 
Davis, 43, is charged with the Aug. 3 slaving of his stepdaughter. Andrea 
Wilborn, 12. 
The motion was expected Friday. 
However, defense attorney Richard 
Haynes said the delay was simply a matter of getting last minute details ironed out. 
The defense must present new evidence in the case in order to insure a new bond hearing will be scheduled. 
State District Court Judge Tom Cave denied Davis bond last fall after five days of testimony that saw two wit­ nesses implicate Davis in a shooting spree at his SB million mansion here.

NBC cuts night Emmy show 

BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - The Na­ tional Broadcasting Company notified the National Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences on Friday that it is canceling the 1977 Emmy awards show for nighttime televison. 
NBC said it would be “ embarrass­ ing” to televise the program because many television stars had refused to participate. 
Com edian’s son fears for father 

SANTA MONICA, Calif. (A P) - Attorneys for 
Groucho Marx’s son told a court Friday that the comedian’s companion. Erin Fleming, is a threat to his life and should be removed as his temporary conservator. 
At the very least, attorneys for Arthur Marx con­ tended in a hearing before Superior Court Judge 
Edward Rafeedie, a doctor should examine the comedian to make sure he is being properly treated. 
The court heard a private detective testify that he found syringes stashed in a storm drain at Marx's home and also saw Miss Fleming shout obscenities at the 86-year-old comedian and scream at him to sign a check. 
Miss Fleming, about 4(1, has been appointed tem­ porary conservator for Marx and has been his busi­ ness manager for seven years. She is seeking to become permanent conservator. 
J. Brin Schulman, attorney for Marx’s son, said he planned to have a doctor testify that the syringes found at Marx's home contained unprescribed bar­ biturates. 
Schulman said the syringes were evidence that 
Marx’s life was in danger as long as Miss Fleming remained conservator. 
Miss Fleming’s attorney Stanley Gold told the judge. “ Counsel has been pussyfooting around .... 
Ile suspects Miss Fleming may be attempting to murder Mr. Marx.” 
Rafeedie made no ruling and ordered the hearing to resume Monday. 
Private investigator Norman Perle said Miss 
Fleming yelled obscenities and was very abusive to 
Marx while trying to get him to sign a check. Marx eventually signed the check. 

SAN ANTONIO SHOWING 

The threatened boycott by major performers — including past Emmy winners Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie 
Harper and Edward Asner — stemmed from a dispute between the National 
Academy and its Hollywood chapter. 
The show had been tentatively scheduled for May 15. 
NBC said it still plans to televise on 
May 12 the Emmy awards for daytime shows. 

By DEBORAH W ESER 
A San Antonio woman with a long history of shoplifting was sentenced Friday to a maximum six months in jail and fined $1,o1)11 for stealing a hat from an exclusive North Side boutique. 
Mary Lerma, 52, of the 2oo block of West Salinas 
Street, is currently free on a $25,ooo bond. She is appealing a three-year prison sentence handed down last year follow ing her plea of guilty on a felony theft charge in 144th District Court. 
Bond was continued after she was found guilty on the shoplifting misdemeanor by County Court-at- 
Law No. 2 Judge John Bell. Her attorney gave notice of appeal. 
She was arrested Nov. 18 by a security guard at 
Lady Cricket Fashions, North Star Mall. Ms. Lerma was accused of taking a $7.5o angora knit hat and leaving the shop without paying for it. 
The earlier offense occurred in August 1975 when 
Crash survivors undergoing therapy 

The 12 badly burned survivors of history’s worst aviation disaster are all receiving “ routine physical 
•therapy,” a spokesman at Brooke Army Medical 
Center’s burn unit said Friday. 

Eight of the survivors of the collision of jumbo jets in the Canary Islands last month remain in “ very serious condition” and four are listed in “ serious” condition, the spokesman said. 

Two of the very seriously injured are in the in­ tensive care unit of the burn treatment center at Ft. 
Sam Houston. 
Fourteen survivors were airlifted to Brooke after the crash, including two who could walk. Those two ambulatory cases have been released from the ho­ spital, the spokesman said. 

The federal privacy act prohibits military author­ ities from identifying individual patients or their conditions, the spokesman said. 

He said those patients not in intensive care get up each day and move around. Families are allowed to visit daily at noon and in the evening. 

 she and another woman were caught shoplifting 23 
The prosecution’s side of the case was handled by shirts from Joske’s in North vStar Mall.

It’s all over for 

Bv KEVIN O K E E FFE 
OF THE EXPRESS-NEWS STAFF 
The place was different, but the scene was the sam e — the celtics had won another playoff series. The umpteenth. 

M ost in the d re ssin g room were nonchalant, many had been there be­ fore. John Havlicek, the Celts’ venera­ ble old man, sat on a training table, icing down his knee. 
“ We hit some key 
.J ilP jiik . sh o ts,” the 14-year o k veteran said of a six- for-six stretch m id- way in the third* quarter, keeping the defending w orld cham pions well in 
':k front. “Also, our loss ’ of 
C harlie 
(C e lts’ 
$ 
• guard Scott who was ejected) did not effect 
O K EE FFE us im m ediately. 
“ Now, at the end of the game when the 
Spurs started to press, we needed him. 

 we needed another ballhandler.” 
Scott, the Celtics’ fiery guard, took an early shower — he was booted out with 4:2o left in the third quarter — when he protested too loudly to offi­ cials Roger McCann and Don Durr. 
The refs had sent Spurs’ Goby Die- trick to the line to shoot a one-and- one... or was it a three-to-make-two. 
“That was the whole thing.” Scott, showered and relaxed afterw ards, said. “ One guy said one thing and the other said another thing. I .just wanted to find out what was happening. 
"So, I took the ball after the first free throw and they called a delay of game on me. I couldn’t have been delaying the game because the ball was dead. If they want to call a technical on me, that is fine, but not delay of game.” 
Boston Coach Tom Heinsohn, who stomped and yelled throughout the game, as usual, had a simple reason for his team ’s success against the 
Spurs (Boston won all six games, four regular season and two playoff) this year. 
“ We are a better ball club,” Hein­ 

 sohn said, sipping a post-game Coke. 
“We have guys who are experienced and we do things well. 
“The Celtics have been in pressure situations before. We took the Spurs initial blow (an 8-o spurt at the game's outset), called time out and got go­ ing.” 
Heinsohn had little to say about the officials, who were replacements for the striking regulars. 

“We won the game,” he stated ter­ sely. “ We won the game in front of a hostile crowd. Heck, the last three minutes Havlicek was getting bumped bv three guys and we could not get a call.” 
C e lts’ 
President and 
General 
Manager Red Auerbach, founder of the 
Celtic dynasty as coach in the late ‘5os and early ‘6os, had his traditional vic­ tory cigar going when he walked into the dressing room. 
“Tommy, you did great to win the game,” Red said. “ They were trying to 

 offense is purring, shot just 4o.7 per cent. 
The Spurs were the most productive free throw team in the league during the regular season, but they even re­ fused charity, hitting o4.1 per cent from the line. 
“ Boston played great, absolutely super,” said Spurs Coach Doug Moo, 
“and W hite was absolutely fantastic. 
“ We fought like hell, but it wasn’t our game. We missed a lot of shots when we had to have them, but even our free throw shooting went. 
“ Sure, we had som e defensive lapses, but it wasn't because of a lack of effort. It wasn’t great defense, but at least the effort was there.” 
White was white hot, hitting 15 of 19 field goals while scoring 38 points. Ile took advantage of many of the Spurs' momentary defensive lapses, coming up with open jumpers from medium range as well as several breakaways.

CHICAGO — Mickey Johnson, Artis Gil­ more and Wilbur Holland combined for 13 points in the final five minutes to lift the 
Chicago Bulls to a 1o7-1o4 triumph over the 
Portland Trial Blazers Friday night and even their best-of-three National Basketball 
Association playoff series at one gam e apiece. 
Johnson, who collected IO of his 29 points in the final quarter, tied the game at 94-94 on a jump shot with 4:55 remaining and the Bulls gained the lead for good on Holland’s jump shot moments later. 
The game was marred by a second quarter free- for-all in which Portland’s Herm Gilliam was eject­ ed for kicking Holland. The fight erupted after 
Gilliam and Holland became involved in a pushing and elbowing match.

Even the Spur President couldn’t get inside the team ’s dressing room after S.A. was eliminated from the playoffs by Boston Friday night. 

Angelo Drossos. president of the 
Spurs, tried to enter the dressing room but was told by I8-year-old 
Mike Hagen, the door boy, that 
Coach Doug Moe had said not to let anyone enter. 

“ I’m the owner,” insisted Dros­ sos. 

“ Coach Moe said nobody,” re­ plied the youngster. 

Drossos exchanged several heat­ ed words with the youngster and struggled trying to open the dress­ ing room door. 

But not until Coach Moe came to the rescue did the owner of the team get inside to talk to the players.

• From all parts of the country 
— 
Atlanta, 
Phoenix, 
Dallas, 
Fort 
L au derd ale, and 
Los 
Angeles — they flew into San 
Antonio for F rid ay n ig h t’s 
Spurs-Celtics playoff game. 

«But they didn’t come to watch the action. Instead, they came to picket, to protest. 

; Ja c k M adden, E ddie M iddleton. 
Tommy Nunez, Ken Falkner and Hue 
Hollins are five of the 24 NBA referees who have been on strike since last 
Sunday. 

For almost two hours prior to Friday night’s game, they stood in front of the press entrance displaying their signs of protest — “ NBA — Unfair to La­ bor.” 
Members of the National Association of Basketball Officials, these refs paid their own way to S.A. to draw attention lo their cause. 
Hollins, w ho resides in Los Angeles, was hit the hardest. His round-trip airplane ticket was $232 — about what he would have m ade had he been working the game. 
The referees’ union is dem anding more money, more benefits and better, security, but the NBA has refused to negotiate with the Association until it is officially recognized by the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
"W e’re no different than any other u n io n ,’’ said Nunez, who lives in 

Phoenix. ‘‘We don’t have to be recog­ nized by the NLRB as long as we represent a majority of our organiza­ tion.” 
“ Yeah, th a t’s r ig h t,” said two others. 
Hollins is on a part-time, 4o-game contract. “ I make $225 a game,” said the NBA rookie ref. “ I had to take a big cut in pay to get into this business. I have a Masters in psychology — I took a big loss.” 

The five officials, who caught some nasty verbal blows from fans passing by, were especially bitter about the 
NBA hiring substitute officials last week. With the threat of a strike by the refs, the NBA had two stand-by offi­ cials ready at all games in case of a last-minute walkout. 
“ We figured it up,” said Madden. 
“ Just for that week. the NBA had to 

 pay between $4o,ooo and $45,ooo for those subs. They paid each sub $3oo per game, plus expenses. Heck, that’s more than some of our guys made who have been working six or seven years. 
“ Take Wally Rooney, for instance. 
He’s in his eighth year and he makes 
$25o a game. These inexperienced subs w ere being paid m ore than h im ,” complained Madden. 
“ This is my first game to picket,” said Middleton. “ I haven’t seen a ga­ me yet (refereed by the subs) but from what I’ve been told it’s atrocious. 
“ I’ve talked to a few of the players coming in here tonight and they ob­ viously are not happy with the offi­ ciating.” 

Madden admitted that it is unfair to the players and fans to have to settle for inexperienced refs during the im­ portant playoff season. 

“ I don't think ifs fair to the players but I don’t think ifs fair to us that the 
NBA will not negotiate,” .said Madden. 
“ The total, across-the-bo ard in ­ crease that we were asking for in the playoffs was $19,ooo. Look, they (NBA) have already paid between $4o,ooo and 
$45,ooo to the subs,” he added. 
“ We’re human.” said Nunez. “ We have families. We want security. We’re just like everyone else. I cherish my job. I love what I do and I hope to be back next year. I just hope there are no reprisals. 
Does carry in g pickets help their cause? 
“ Yes, I think so,” said Madden. “ It has helped us get our point across to people like you. The point is the NBA has refused to negotiate a contract with us for these playoffs or for next season. 
“ I never thought it would come to 

 this (strike),” said Middleton. “ But remember, it didn’t start over-night. It started at the all-star break.” 
The five unem ployed refs were seeking publicity and sympathy but they didn’t get it from everyone. 
" I ’m glad you (bleeping) turkeys are out here and not in there,” one irate fan yelled. 
“ You belong outside.” 
“That’s okay,” Falkner screamed as the fan entered the Arena. “ Just wait 
‘til you see what kind of job those other guys do tonight. You’ll wish you had us back after you see those guys.” 
Hollins grabbed Louie Dumpier and 
George Gervin as they were entering the Arena. Joked Hollins, “ Hey man, don't go in there. You can’t cross a picket line.” 
“ Strike, hell,” replied Gervin. “ I’m fined $5 for every minute I’m late. Let me inside — quick!”

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS 

MIDLAND — The San Antonio 
Dodgers erupted for six runs in the first two innings and made the lead stand up as they took their first victory of the season, 
8-5, over the Midland Cubs Fri­ day night. 

Marv Webb slam m ed a three-run homer in the second inning to put the 
Dodgers out in front, 6-o, and the lead was never relinquished. 
A fter M id la n d ’s Karl Pagle, a fo rm e r U n iv ersity of Texas sta r, touched Dodger starter for a three-run double in the third, Barry Biggerstaff came in later to do a brilliant job in relief. 
Biggerstaff allowed two hits, includ­ ing a two-run shot by Homer Gustafson in the fifth, and two walks in 423 inn­ i n g s of work to pick up his first win of the year against no losses. 
Also doing a good job at the plate for 
San Antonio were Jeff Leonard and Art 
Fischetti, who both went two for four. 
The victory upped the Dodgers’ re­ cord to 1-2 and was the lone triumph in an opening three-game series with the 
Cubs (2-1).

No-hitter 

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - John Pa- cella, making his Texas League debut, hurled a no-hitter Friday night as the 
Jack so n M ets downed the T ulsa 
Drillers 3-o. 
The no-hitter was the first ever for a 
Mets pitcher and gave the team its first victory of the season after two losses to Tulsa. 
Pacella’s only problem was control, as he hit two batters and walked six. 
Paul Mirabella, o-1. took the loss. 
Jackson scored all three runs in the first, two of them on a double by Juan 
Monesterio.

BRISTOW goes up for shot against Celtics 

CHARLIE SCOTT pulled on b y coach Helnsohn 

Continued from Page IC 
5:29 left, started a com eback that brought them to within four points of the Celts. 
Goby Dietrick and Larry Kenon hit jumpers to cut the margin to nine, but 
Kenon then fouled out on a drive to the basket. Olberding brought it to seven with a layup, but Sidney Wicks hit a break aw ay and White sank a free throw when Dietrick was called for a technical foul. 
Tip-in 

Nothing new 

Continued from Page IC take it from you at the end, and you held on.” 
Jo Jo White, Scott's partner in the backcourt, was the real wrecking crew against San Antonio. The Kansas alum was 15 of 19 from the floor, eight for eight from the free throw line , and wound up with 38 points, a career-high effort. 
“ He (White) played g re a t,” Hein-*' sohn said. "He was the difference. He kept us going. When we lost Charlie, we had to push the ball up the court and White did a good job. “ We wanted to put Jo Jo in a shooting situation.” 
“ I just stopped counting,” White said of his points. “ I knew we had a chance to beat them here. The crowd was loud, but we had to tune them out. 
Now, Charlie lost his head a little. 
“ I think their (Spurs) guards lost concentration a little. I moved well and was wide open for a couple of shots in my range.” 
“ White was really hot,” Boston’s red-haired center Dave Cowens chimed in. “ I was looking for him all night. 
You have to look for the guy with the hot hand. 
“ He made me look good in the as­ sists column tonight (Cowens had nine).” 
And Cowens, along with the UCLA connection, Sidney Wicks and Curtis 
Rowe, owned the backboards again 
F rid a y night, o u tre b o u n d in g the 
Spurs, 44-33. 
“ I did not think it was particularly p h y sic a l,” Cowens said. “ (L arry) 
Kenon is not physical. (George) Gervin is not either.” 

“ We just played really well tonight,” 
Wicks, a Celtic newcomer this year, stated. “ We did not rely on one person. 
Everyone worked really hard.’’

SPECIAl TO THE EXPRESS NEWS 

OMAHA, Neb. — Robert Paxton of 
Trinity won reduced Clay Pigeon pro­ gram* in the National Intercollegiate 
Shooting meet Friday. 
Paxton hit 74 of 75 targets, while runnerup Tom Higgins of Drake had 73 * hits. Julie Bethel of Tulane won the women’s division with 48 points, fol­ lowed by Carla Brundage of Trinity with 45. 

Two straight shimmy shake drives to the hoop by George Gervin was fol­ lowed by a volleyball, tip-tip-score hoop by Allan Bristow to m ake it, 
1o9-1o5, with 1:29 to go. 
A Dave Cowens layup was answered by a pair of Gervin free throws. Bris­ tow fouled White who, naturally, sank both, and Cowens fouled Bristow, who bounced both off the rim. 
Wicks was called for a three-second violation with 2o seconds left, and 
Cowens fouled out with 13 seconds re­ maining. Gervin sank both. 
A Bristow steal and unsuccessful drive by the Iceman ended the Spurs’ march to an early summer. 
“ Wicks hits a flying fallaway from the corner, (Fred) Saunders puts in shots from the c o rn e r.” said Moe. 
“ They’re a 44 per cent shooting team, and tonight they hit 53. 
“ Our shooting percentage from the field and the free throw line migtht’ve indicated we were tight. 
“ We put the pressure on ourselves by losing five out of our last six in the regular season. We worked our butts off in both playoff games, but some­ times when you work so hard, nothing goes right.” 
Fast start 

Nothing could go wrong at the start as the Spurs scored the gam e’s first eight points, Gervin scoring six of them, sprained right thumb and all. lie ended up with 31). 
Five straight Celtic points early iii the second quarter — two by Tom 
Boswell and three by Wicks gave 
Boston a 32-3o lead. Gervin tied it mo­ ments later with a jum per from the free throw line. 
But a 15-footer by Charlie Scott and a 
White follow shot gave the Celts un 
Ever last lead. 
Trailing, 78-71. with 4:2o left in the third, San Antonio had a chance to m ake sizable gains when Scott was booted after protesting too long and too loudly over the allocation of free throws. 
Gervin made one of the free throws as Tommy Heinsohn, the Boston coach, was somehow allowed by the officials to stand on the floor not more than 19 feet from Gervin. 
C learly, the officials — Roger 
McCann and Don D urr — lost total control of the game. Heinsohn com­ plained to McCann at the conclusion of the game, and McCann replied, “ 1 11 talk to you about it later.” 

T O M M Y N U N E Z pickets outside A rena 

Down by six and with Scott gone to an early shower, however, Boston scored two straight on buckets by John 
Huvlicek and, guess who? White, to up the margin to IO. 
"I don’t think Boston taught us any­ thing about playoff basketball.” said 
Moe. “ In the Masters, if Tom Watson misses a big shot, they say ‘Watson choked.’ If Nicklaus misses, they’d never say it. 
“ If we’d lost to another team, would we have learned anything? 
Strong game 

“ I’d rather lose because the other team played good instead of us playing badly. And that’s the way it was. We gave it a helluva try.” 
Billy Paultz played a strong game, scoring 2o while being outrebounded only slightly by the world’s most fa­ mous cab driver, Cowens, 9-7. Dietrick was as hot as any Spur, hitting eight of 
14 for 17 points. 
“ I took Billy out for a rest at the end because he was exhausted.” said Moe. 
“ When we went into a pressing defense we were going well so I decided to stay with who we had in there.” 

“ It was,” said guard Louie Dampier, 
“ a lousy way to end the season.”

Kopay’s gay life is now open book 

It was about this time two years ago when the Washington Star newspaper did a series examining homosexuality among National 
Football League players. Those pieces stirred a lot of controversy and the results are still being felt. 
For one thing, the series prompted the “ coming out” of Dave 
Kopay, a nine-year NFL veteran who has worn the uniforms of San 
Francisco, Washington, New Orleans and Green Bay. Kopay, a reserve running back and star specialty team member, not only admitted his preferred life style but he wrote a book entitled The 
Dave Kopay Story. 
As you might suspect, Kopay’s story centers around his sex habits. At the moment that book is somewhere between eight and 12 on the current best-seller list. Kopay has spent the last five weeks sashaying around the country pumping and stumping for more book sales. 

He says he'll continue for the benefit 

 of himself and other homosexuals. The emphasis might be on himself for many feel that he’s simply commer­ cializing on his homosexuality. In Dal­ las last Tuesday Kopay visited with five different media groups — count 
'em, five —• to tell one and all about his book, his problems, his sex life. 

You might imagine the controversy stirred among sports fans but it's dif­ ficult to grasp the biting effect Kopay’s never-ending tour is having on some 
NFL players. 
It was a former NFL teammate, Ron 
Medved, who recently said, “ will there ever come a time when Kopay doesn’t feel like he has to talk about it?” Well, at the last reading, the answer to that might be, probably not. Dave seems to be just getting started. 

Besides, he’s so pleased with his 

 book, actually written by Perry Dean 
Young, another homosexual, it seems a safe bet that another Kopay special will soon be on the drawing board. For himself and other homosexuals, you understand. Of course, nature and things being the way they are, if the book is ever converted into a smash movie we won’t have to sit around and wait for “ Son of Kopay.” 

A Dallas friend of Dave’s informed me that, even though San Antonio is not on Kopay’s listed stops, he feels certain that he can work in an inter­ view for me, a Kopay exclusive for this area. 
It's always nice to be remembered but I passed. This isn t to knock Dave for w hat he is or w hat he's doing bul, tit be honest, the sex habits of a former football player interest me about as much as the pecan crops in South 
Carolina. 

Okay then, you might ask, why use 

 that as a topic for today’s piece here? 
Glad you asked. 

Seems like a fair question. 
Gay movement 

The Washington Post wasn’t the first publishing house to focus on homosex­ uality in major sports lint that newspaper was the first major outfit to center on the NFL. 

Leaders of the so-eallod “ gay move­ ment” applauded the series, many of them happy to hear the nation getting told that their group included some of the muscled monsters of Sunday grid wars. Now they're cheering Kopay and his book he fans the fires to keep the coals glowing. 

From a personal viewpoint it’s never been much of a concern to me what manner of games consenting adults might choose behind closed doors. Key words there, of course, are “ consent­ ing” and “ adults.” 
My feelings were expressed here years ago by a one-time headline boxer who didn’t carry an overload of edu­ cation. Eddie Brant, a tough welter­ weight, was taken aside by a friend one afternoon and told that one of his new­ ly-acquired handlers was gay. “ I peeked into a back room and saw him kissing some dude right on the mouth,” the fellow whispered to Brant. 
Without hesitation Eddie replied, “ hey man, it's his mouth, I don’t care if he carries coal in it.”

 cace—- 

Suddenly, it seemed to me that 
Eddie carried a much heavier load of w isdom any of us had figured. 

But back to the movement. Besides 

 selling books, it’s never been clear to me just what the self-acclaimed gay leaders want or expect. The two words used most often are “ acceptance” and 
“ recognition.” If acceptance means that we squares don’t throw stones at 
’em, can the ridicule and offer a fair shake on employment, great. Then I ’ve got to be for the gay movement. 

The way it is 

But that recognition part freezes my 
Frisbee. Why is it so important for homosexuals to be recognized as a group? Kopay talks about integrity, honesty and “ recognition” as he par­ ades about the country. 

Okay, so the guy likes guys. So the 

 movement is pleased with such publi­ city. But does this mean that we’re supposed to have a national gay day, a gay float in all parades, a homo section in cafeterias? 

The problems of homosexuality are understandable. The goals of some ho­ mosexuals are vague and strange, to say the least. 

There are still some in the NFL who are gay. Even a few switch hitters. 
Numbers and percentages told us this fact long before the Washington Post decided on its series. Collect 1,4oo people for any kind of work — from dynamite blasters to high wire walkers 
— and you’re going to have at least a few homosexuals. 

That's just the way things are and have been for centuries. Don't cherish the idea that big league baseball, pro basketball or any other sport is without some gay athletes. Acceptance of the truth is sometimes difficult to handle so it’s easy to understand why accep­ tance would be one of the goals of ho­ mosexuals. 

But recognition is something else. 

Especially recognition of homosexual groups. Exactly what would be the purpose other than to attract others who might still be unsure? 

It’s rather amazing how those who plead for fair play always get de­ manding and scream for two measures more once fair play starts coming their way. Kopay seems to have all sorts of goals in mind hut right now his main objective revolves around book sales. 
His book, of course. 
Rice, 8-3 

HOUSTON (AP) - Allan Ramirez tossed a four-hitter and Steve Buejley drove in three runs Friday as the Rice 
Owls scored an 8-3 Southwest Confer­ ence baseball victory over the Arkan­ sas Razorbacks. 
Ramirez, who won his fifth confer­ ence game against only one loss, had a no-hitter going for six innings. 
Buckley had a double and a triple as the Owls handed Arkansas starting pitcher David Rhodes, now 5-1, his first league loss of the season. 
Arkansas’ Tim Lundquist beat out a slow roller in the seventh inning for the first hit off Ramirez and later scored on a shot to center by Mare Brumbie.

Contesting feed theory 

F^ish feed early and late. 
That’s why fishing “ is usually best in the morning and again late in the evening.’’ So says the author of an article concerning the fish feeding theory. 

The writer also explained “ why fish don't feed during the day.” 
“ Biologists have learned that it takes five or six hours for a fish to digest the food in its stomach, and then a few' more hours before the fish starts to get hungry again. So anglers can expect about half a day to pass between active feeding periods for most, freshwater fish,” he said. 

I don't agree. I cannot dispute the 

 length of time it takes for a fish to digest its meal, hut f certainly dispute the statement that fish don't feed dur­ ing the day. 

As far as why early and late hours often — but not always — produce strikes, I think the writer almost had the answer but let it get away from him. 
“ They feed mostly at dawn and dusk,” he said, “ times when they have the best advantage over their prey.” 
Light conditions at those two periods of the day probably have more to do with why a fish such as a largemouth bass feeds early and late than hunger pains. Poor light conditions give the predator an advantage over the prey. 

D on’t ignore the moon 

The writer bases his theory on feed­ ing activity of freshwater fish solely on the sun. He’s ignoring or forgetting the moon, and the movement of the moon might have more to do with when a fish feeds than the sun. 
I do not believe major feeding per­ iods occur like clockwork at the same

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday April 16 1977 
 ynn in lead 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

CARLSBAD, Calif. — Longshot Bob 
Wynn, who said he’s “ playing about as well as I can play,’’ swept past the faltering leaders with a solid, five-under-par 67 and established a three-stroke lead over Jack 

 time each day. I believe they vary, depending on the position of the moon and, to some extent, the sun. 

I know that some of the best fishing I 

 have experienced has occurred between the hours of IO a.m. and 3 p.m. 

I believe the major feeding period of bass can occur at any time during 24 hours, night, dusk, dawn or day. 
There are some reservoirs on which the dawn and dusk theory probably applies — for the fisherman. These are reservoirs with extremely clear waters. 
The fisherman often has better suc­ cess fishing early in the morning, late in the evening and at night — because of the poor light conditions — than he does when the sun is high even though a major feeding period might occur at high noon. 
In poor light it’s just easier to fool a wary fish. 

Ciliium & Boren contest 

Ciliium & Boren Sporting Goods will sponsor a bass fishing contest from 
April 17 to June 3o and is offering 
$1,2oo worth of prizes. 
The heaviest black bass caught dur­ ing the contest will be worth $7oo in merchandise, including a 15-foot Cole­ man canoe, Quick graphite rod and 
7ooB reel combination, two sleeping bags, two-man pack tent and other items. 
Five additional prizes will be awarded each month for the five hea­ viest bass entered during that month. 
They include a Daiw'a .spinning rod and reel combination, Daiwa bait casting rod and reel, Plano 727 tackle box, 
Zebco 33XBL reel and Eagle Claw rod. 

Fish must be weighed at either Cul­ lom & Boren store, North Star Mall or 
Windsor Park Mall. Preregistration is necessary. Persons who purchase a fishing license at either store auto­ matically registered. Anglers who al­ ready have licenses may obtain free special coupons to preregister. 

The contest will be open to Texas residents only. Fish entered must be caught in Texas, either from public or private waters.

$225,ooo Tournament 
B ogey woes 

HILTON HEAD IS ­ 
LAND, S.C. (AP) - Four bogies on the back side destroyed 
Mary 
Lou 
Crocker’s hopes Friday of another sub-par round and cut her lead to one stroke midway through the second annual Wo­ men’s International Golf 
Tournament. 
Her one-over-par 73, coupled with Thursday’s six-under 66, gave the 
Louisville, Ky., pro a 
36-hole total of 139, five under par. 
Moving into second place after another two- under round was Eng­ land’s Michelle Walker, making a strong bid for her first pro victory in the United States. 
Jan Stephenson, the 
Australian now living in 
Palm Springs, Calif., dropped from second to third with Friday’s round of 73, w'hich gave her a two-day total 141. 
After playing the front side in one-under 35, 
Miss Crocker bogied the 
14th, 15th and 16th holes. 
Then she birdied the 17th but finished with another bogey on the 18th. 
The veteran pro striv­ ing for her second tour­ nament win in 12 years on the tour said slow play and the heat took its toll on her game.

Cup win 

N EW PO RT BEACH, 
Calif. (A P) — Pickets protesting South Africa’s participation in the Davis 
Cup zone finals carried signs saying “ Go Home” and the United States team cooperated by sweeping the first two singles matches Friday, virtually assuring over­ all victory. 
Roscoe Tanner won the final four points to take the first singles match from Byron Bertram 6-4, 
6-2, 1-6, 6-4 at the New­ port Beach Tennis Club. 
Brian Gottfried came back to dominate his match against 
Ray 
Moore 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. The two triumphs left the 
United States just one short of victory in the best-of-five competition with a doubles match scheduled Saturday and two more singles matches Sunday.

The 37-year-old Wynn, one of a record 12 men making their first ap­ pearance in this win- ners-only event, put to­ gether a 36-hole total of 
137, seven under par on the 6,855-yard La Costa 
Country Club course. 
“ I ’m hitting the ball better than I have at any time in the last seven years,” said Wynn, who waited until he was al­ most 3o to join the pro tour and then scored his first official victory only last year in the B.C. 
Open. 
Nicklaus, trying to play his way out of tho let­ down he experienced after falling short in a hid for the Masters last week, shot a 69 and was alone in second at 14o. 
“ It’s not a bad score, hut it was a kind of funny round,” said Nicklaus, who had six birdies and three bogeys. “ I went past a lot of players, but I gave away a few’ shots in the middle of the round.” 
Lietzke had a 7o, Koch 
72 and Miller went to a 74 in the mild, sunny, breezy weather.

Paul Pierce of Sui Ross and Bruce Craig of 
Tarleton have been named the football and basket­ ball Coaches of the Year, respectively, in the Texas 
Intercollegiate Athletic Association. 
After losing its opening two games on the gridiron, 
Sui Ross reeled off seven straight victories. 
Craig guided his Texans to the conference’s basketball tournament championship. 
Trinity’s Gene Norris, whose Tigers won the loop grid title, was football runner and cage runnerup was Austin College’s Boh Mason. 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

NEW YORK — For the Milwaukee Bucks, the National Basketball Association’s coin tosses are becoming a case of heads I win, tails you lose. 

Back in 1969, when the 
NBA held its coin toss to determine who gets first pick in the college draft, 
Phoenix called tails. It came up heads, M il­ waukee got a shot at Lew 
Alcindor and he turned the club into an instant winner. 
On Friday, the process was reversed. The Kan­ sas City Kings called heads and when the silver dollar flipped by 
Commissioner 
Larry 
•O’Brien hit the red car­ pet, it came up tails. 
Thai gave the Bucks the pick of the college crop, and they’ve got their eyes on Kent Benson, the center who led Indiana to the NCAA title in 1976. 

“ If he’s physically fit, we’ll pick Benson,” said 
Bucks General Manager 
Wayne Embry. The only doubt is caused by a back injury which forced Ben­ son to miss the last four games of the season. 
“ Benson is the only pure post man avalai- ble,” said Embry. “ It’s him. There’s nobody else.” 

GARDEN CITY, N.Y. 
(AP) — The New York 
Nets obtained a bank loan in 1973 by using Ju ­ lius Erving and the other members of the team as collateral, Newsday re­ ported in a copyrighted story in its Friday edi­ tions. 

The suburban New1 
York newspaper reported that the Nets, then part of the old American Bas­ ketball Association, re­ ceived a mi Ilion-dollar loan from the Long Is­ land Trust Co. As colla­ teral, the Nets put up 
Ervin g ’s $1.9-million contract and a blanket lien against all of the team’s contracts. 

If Roy Boe and the li­ mited partnership that owned the Nets defaulted on the loan, the bank could have ended up owning the team.

Dibbs advances 

HOUSTON (AP) - Eddie Bibbs, Miami Beach, 
Flu., down 2-5 in the first set, and Italian Adriano 
Punatta, who lost the first set 1-6, rallied to comeback quarter-final victories Friday in the 
$1oo,ooo World Championship Tennis (WCT) tour­ nament at River Oaks Country Club. 
Bibbs, a scrambling baseline specialist, fought back into his match against Harold Solomon, Silver 
Springs, Md., and won 76, 6-2. 
Panatta, who earlier beat top-seeded Jim my 
Connors, defeated Australian Ken Rosewall 1-6, 6-3, 
6-4. 
Bibbs and Panatta will meet Saturday in one semi-final match while second-seeded Hie Nastase will play Vitas Gerulaitis of New York in the other semi-final. 
Rosewell. a two-time River Oaks champion, won 
12 straight points to close out the quick first set. 
Roewall continued his string, breaking Panatta in the first game of the second set before the hard- serving Panatta finally found his range. Panatta broke Rosewall in the second and fourth games and using his serve-and-volley tactics ran off an easy 6-3 second set victory. 
The decisive third set was a neck-and-neck race with each player getting two service breaks. The turning point came in the ninth game when Panatta broke Rosewall as Rosewall hit a backhand into the not off a hard forehand.

Jackpot question moot point 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: I’m desperate. My husband and I are both 25 and have been trying to have a child for two years. A recent semen analysis showed my husband has low sperm. Our doctor refuses to dis­ cuss it with us until two more samples are analyzed. 
What does this mean? Can we ever have a child? — 
Mrs. L.B. 
What do you mean, he refuses to discuss it with you? I think you mean he refuses to answer your jackpot question. Will you ever be able to have a child? 
T hat will depend on just how persistently low the sperm count is. and it can take more than a single test to determine it. Sperm is produced and stored by the male and re le a se d with s e ­ men. If your husband had in terco u rse fr e ­ quently soon before the test, his sp erm count would be reduced. I think it is something you should discuss with your doctor, although I s u ­ spect he may have told you about this. Your husband should refrain from intercourse prior to the next test. 
If his sperm count is reasonably high, and if you are ovulating and are otherwise healthy, th ere’s little reason why you shouldn’t bear a child. The lower the sperm count the lower the odds of con­ ception. but it is always a possibility even with a quite low count. 
Heart patient 
Dear Dr. Thosteson: I am a heart patient. I have non-rheumatic myocarditis, but I don’t understand what that means. I had all the tests run, and that’s what they came up with. 
Would you please give your explanation of the disease. I am 33. Is it related to heart failure? — 
Mrs. J.M. 
The causes of most types of heart disease are readily determined — congenital (birth) defects, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis (artery har­ dening) and so on. Various prominent clues can tell exactly why the heart is not behaving as it should. 
Myocarditis (inflammation of the muscles in the heart wall) is a sort of maverick, generalized diag­ nosis settled on when other possibilities have been exhausted. “ Non-rheumatic” means that it is not due to rheumatic fever. 
There are several other possible causes for such inflammation — virus infection as from influenza, measles, or mumps, the effects of diphtheria, or rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few. 
When the heart is involved there is usually a fast irregular beat, shortness of breath, and chest pain. 
You mention heart failure. This can occur in se­ vere cases or when the inflam m ation becom es chronic. The only thing to do immediately is to treat the inflammation. In the meanwhile, the search must continue to try to pinpoint a specific cause so it can be corrected. 
I assume that right now your doctors are involved in this on-going detective work to find out why your heart muscle became inflamed. For a copy of my booklet dealing with heart symptoms, send 25 cents and a stamped, self-addressed envelope to me care of this newspaper. It will offer more specific infor­ mation than I can in this space.

U nnecessary wail 

I am very much disgruntled with the automobile department of our tax office. 
On April 4,1 went to the Bexar County Courthouse to buy my 1977 sticker. I had lost my 1976 receipt. and although it had expired April I, they made me stand in line to get a duplicate. 
To make matters worse, I had bought my 1976 sticker in Houston so they did not have it on record here. They had to contact Austin to get verification. 
After spending about three hours in line, they finally gave me a duplicate license receipt for 1976. 
When I got back to the license sticker line, the young lady who issued the sticker pulled the 1976 duplicate off the title and threw it away (in the trash can) with the remark, “ Since this is expired we do not need it.” 
I later checked with the Texas Highway Depart­ ment and they told me the same thing. That is, that an expired license receipt is totally worthless and unnecessary. 
The department also said that whether this car was registered in 1976 or not had no bearing on buying the 1977 sticker after the 1976 sticker had expired. 
What is the deal? 
J. W. A. 

 rw e — *> 

A spokesman from the 
Bexar County Tax-Asses- sor C ollector’s office agreed with everything you said in your letter except the last para­ graph, 
If the last tim e your car was registered was 
1975, you would have had to present a non-use af­ fidavit to them and paid for five quarters before you could get your 1977 sticker. 
If you had just bought 

 the car, you would also have had to pay for five quarters before you could get the sticker. 
Even if It was a used car and had been sitting in a lot for over a year, it would have had a 1976 sticker according to Tex­ as law. 
So, the reason you had to stand in line for three hours to get your dupli­ cate 1976 receipt was to prove you had a 1976 sticker. 

International mail 

Do you know of any place I can get a listing of the current postal rates for overseas mailing to an AFO 
New York address? 
The Post Office says it does not have one. My daughter lives in Germany and I often mail pack­ ages to her. 
She says that if I mail them SAM — space available mail — or PAL — parcel air lift — the postage is cheaper but I would like to know the rates so I could weigh my own packages and estimate my cost of mailing by the various methods. 
Thank you for your help. 
MOM 

Frank Coy of the infor­ mation office at the Main 
Post O ffice said you could pick up a copy of 
Publication 51, Interna­ tional Postage Rates and 
Fees, at any one of the 
Post Office sub-stations free of charge. 
But, if you m ail a package to an APO New 

York address, you should not pay international rates. Coy said that was a domestic address so you should pay dom estic rates. 
He said you were wel­ come to call the Post Of­ fice to get any of this in­ formation or to clarify any misconceptions. 

PBS show 

The Public Broadcasting system has started a terrific new series, called the “ American Short 
Story,” which airs every Tuesday night for one hour. 
I read somewhere the show will last for six weeks and feature nine American authors. Through the first two weeks, already shown, they have shown television versions of “ Bernice Bobs her Hair’’ by F. 
Scott Fitzgerald and “ I ani a Fool” by Sherwood 
Anderson and “ The Displaced Person” by Flannery 
O’Connor. 
I would like to ask to find out w hat w ill be shown in the coming four weeks — who the authors are and what stories will be shown. 
I teach freshman English at a local college and want to assign my students to watch certain stories if they are appropriate to the context of my class. 
Also, can you find out if KLRN-TV, Channel 9, can rerun the shows on another night like they do for other programs? Tuesdays are sometimes too busy for me. 
W. F. 

In addition to 7 p.m. 
Tuesday, the “American 
Short Story” is shown at 
1o:3o p.m. Sunday. 
Stephen Crane’s “ The 
Blue H otel” will be shown April 19 and Er­ nest H em ingw ay’s “ A 
Soldier’s Home” and Ri­ chard Wright’s “ Almost a Man” will be shown 
April 26. 
KLRN-TV will not air 

 the sixth story because of another commitment. 
However, the final pro­ gram — like the first one 
— will have two stories, will be aired May IO. The station does not have the listing for that date yet. 
A spokesman from the station said the series would be shown again in late sum m er or early fall. 

Will he go on? 

What is the deal with the Bob Newhart Show? 
P’irst I read in your paper that he would not do the show next year under any circumstances. Now I hear he will. Which is it? 
D. H. 

Newhart has changed his mind. He said there were two reasons: an outpouring of letters to 
CBS to keep the show and 

 a CBS threat to file a $6 m illion law suit if he didn’t do the show one more year.

 building is expected in 
1979 
The building will be about 52,3oo square feet in size, with about 21,5oo square feet on the first floor and about 26.5oo on the second. A mechanical penthouse would com­ plete the alloted space. 
Animal rooms, includ­ ing specialized facilities, will occupy the first floor. 

Only the first floor and the shell of the second floor will be constructed now. 
“ If the legislature pro­ vides funds for the basic science building we have requested, we would hope to award additional con­ tracts for completion of the second floor,” said 
Dr. 
Prank 
Harrison, president. 
Completion of the 

 by Kunz Contruction Co., 
Inc., of San Antonio, which also has the con­ tract for physical plant expansion Phases I and II at the school. 
The building is Phase 
IV of the medical school expansion. It will be built in back of the health science center and will connect with the medical school at the second le-

Northcliffe community becomes popular address 

Northcliffe, at this point, is no household word, but, judging by the way the new $15o million, single-family, resider.tial/golf course community by Home­ craft Corp. is catching on, it soon will be just that. 
The splendidly recreational com­ munity off N E. III 35 just northeast of 
Hubertus Road (FM 11o3) has become a permanent address for numerous fa­ milies since it opened last September. 
‘Nothing but best’ 
Each family that has moved into 
Northcliffe has nothing but the best to say about the neighborhood and the homes they chose. They all agree that no other community is more compre­ hensive of a home buyer's urgent needs and strong desires. 
Northcliffe is stated as the collective name for the community comprised of three different parts: Northcliffe East, 
Northcliffe Country Club Estates and 
Northcliffe. Each sector has a model home park tor the Homecraft houses it offers. . 
The three model home parks, then, represent a wide price range, different lifestyles and, all together, total 13 fully furnished, professionally decor­ ated models. 
The homes in the Northcliffe sectors have received widespread attention because of their innovative, energy- saving Snug Home Program, which 

 includes gray tint solar glass windows, precision-fitted steel doors insulated and with a refrigerator-type magnetic weatherstrip, insulated foil-back sheathing and an energy-efficient, all-electric air conditioning and heat­ ing system. 
In addition to Homecraft’s exclusive 
Snug Home Program, the Northcliffe homes, as a whole, have a one-year warranty on construction and all ser­ viceable products. 
Northcliffe East models two- to four-bedroom homes priced from 
$27,5oo to $36,9oo. Northcliffe Country 
Club Estates has homes priced from 
$62,5oo to $1o3,ooo, and many have a view of the area’s 18-hole champion­ ship golf course. Northcliffe offers spacious three- and four-bedroom homes priced from $43,5oo to $44,95o. 
Northcliffe East homes feature 
Homecraft’s exclusive Option Pro­ gram, as well. The basic home here boasts an all-brick exterior with a two-car garage, finished cabinetry, boxed window seats and, in three-be­ droom plans, sliding glass patio doors.. 
The buyer has the option, according to needs and budgets, to add one or all of the option features, such as carpeting, wallpaper, oversized patio, room-fin­ ished garage and appliances — range, dishwasher,,disposer, air conditioner or vent hood — and wall cabinet. For example, if the owner did not wish to install dishwasher at move-in, they have hook-ups ready for immediate 

 installation later. 
Northcliffe Country Club Estates is an exclusive home community sur­ rounded by the natural beauty and en­ vironment of an 18-hole championship golf course. Some of these homes' striking features include gourmet kit­ chens. luxury appointment in master baths and double fireplaces with a view from master suites and dens. 
Homeowners hold the choices for co­ lors of paint, carpet, formica and wallpaper, as well as selection in roof and brick. 
Northcliffe offers a wide variety of exterior designs. Traditional. Medi­ terranean, French and the like, and four distinctive floor plans. Each fea­ tures a woodburning fireplace, all­ brick exterior and spacious kitchen 

 with built-in cabinets and all-electric kitchens. In addition, there is a prac­ tical pantry and washer - dryer area with overhead built-in cabinets adja­ cent to the two-car garage. F'our de­ corated models are open here. 

As a whole. Northcliffe is located on 
8o5 acres with substantial frontage along N.E. IU 35. Northcliffe Country 
Club Estates is in the Comal School 
District; Northcliffe East and North­ cliffe, Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City 
District. 
Construction is well under way on 
Phase I of Northeliffe’s $2 million golf, tennis and swim club amenity pro­ gram. 

NORTHCLIFFE, a three - part com m unity off N. E. IH 35 just north east of H ubertus R oad (FM I 1o3), offers splendid recreational facilities for its residents

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Saturday April 16 1977' 
Book tells of saving home fuel 

SPECIAL TO THE GOLDEN TWINS 
C O LLEG E STATION 
— Texans planning to buy or build a new home can save on utility costs by incorporating energy - efficient designs and equipment featured in a new publication issued by the Energy Advisory 
Service for 
Texas 
(EA ST ) at Texas A&M 
University. 
Entitled “ Plain Talk 
About Buying or Building an 
Energy-Efficient 
Home,” the publication is available to all inter­ ested Texans. It dis­ cusses four major areas of concentration to achieve home energy efficiency: thermal resis­ tance, attic ventilation, air leakage reduction and efficient serving systems 
. . . (air conditioning, heating, water heating and the like). 
“ A great deal of home energy conservation ma­ terial being distributed today is designed mainly for colder, northern cli­ mates, according to Dr. 
Stephen Kiter, director of the EAST program at 
Texas A&M. “ Our publi­ cation concentrates on energy conservation de­ vices and techniques particularly suited to the 
Texas climate. 
For instance, the largest en­ ergy consumer in many 
Texas homes is the air conditioning unit; not the heating unit, as in north­ ern areas.” 
“ The best time to 

 make a home energy ef­ ficient is during con­ struction,” Patterson says. “ This saves the home owner the lime and expense of changing equipment, adding insu­ lation and similar actions which can be taken later but which involve more complicated and costly procedures.” 
Patterson notes that over a long-term mort­ gage. a home owner’s in­ creased monthly pay­ ments for the added costs of building in energy- efficient equipment will be more than recovered through smaller monthly utility bills. 
He adds that homes which use less energy will be an even better in­ vestment if residential fuel and electricity rates rise as expected in future years. 
A recent report by the 
Federal Energy Admin­ istration indicates resi­ dential fuel costs likely will nearly double by 
1985. 
“ Plain Talk About 
Buying or Building an 
Energy 
- 
Efficient 
Home” is available by writing or calling the 
Energy Advisory Service for Texas, Center for 
Energy Advisory Service for Texas, Center for 
Energy and Mineral Re­ sources, Texas A&M 
University, College Sta­ tion. TX 77843. The tele­ phone number is I - 713 -

Loper loans first GPM 

'Hie first loan made 
The GPM plan is es* under a new program tablished under the ex­ designed to enable young perimental financing fam ilies to meet their authority of Section 245 of mortgage payments the National Housing more easily in early Act. A limited amount of years of home ownership mortgage insurance is was issued recently by a available under the law 
San Antonio mortgage during the current fiscal company, according to year. Some 3,5oo units 
Patricia Roberts Harris, may be insured under secretary of the U. S. allocations made to HUD 
Department of Housing field offices. 
CLASSIFIED DISPLAY and Urban Development 
(HUD). 

The FHA-insured loan was issued to a young couple in San Antonio by 
Loper Mortgage Co., 2o6 
San Pedro Ave. 
GPM Plan 
The financing was ar­ ranged under HUD’s 
Graduated 
Payment 
Mortgage Plan (G PM ) by which home buyers make small monthly payments in the early years of a loan and grad-1 ually larger payments in later years of a loan and gradually larger payments in later years until they level off at fixed amounts. 

“ It is a pleasure to re­ port the first mortgage loan to be made under the plan,” Sec. Harris said. “ The new program should prove very beneficial to American home buyers.” 
The first home buyers under the GPM plan are 
George Castillo, 28, and his wife. Virginia, 25, who, with their one- year-old baby girl, now live at 493o Brandeis St. 
Castillo, who holds i master of arts degree, is: engaged in social work at the Villa Rosa Annex of: the Santa Rosa Medical 
Center. He has a monthly, take-home pay of $1,1oo, which would have been insufficient to meet monthly payment re­ quirements under HUD- 
FHA regular home mort­ gage insurance program 
(Section 
2o3-b of 
(ho 
National Housing Act). 
The GPM plan, how­ ever, makes possible sm aller monthly pay­ ments in the early years of the loan and this ena­ bled the Castillos to meet 
EHA minimal repayment guidelines. 
Under the plan, $35o a month would go for housing outlays, includ­ ing principal and interest on the $32,8oo loan for the 
$37,5oo home. Also in­ cluded in the monthly outlay is an estimated amount for maintenance and utilities. 
Under the regular single-familv .FUA in­ surance program, corre­ sponding monthly pay­ ments would amount to 
$41o. The main difference results from the larger monthly payments of $6o for principal and interest required by the regular program. 

How did the energy crisis af­ fect construction of the modern homes? 

In most cases, it heightened the long 
- exciting awareness of the builder of how to work in harmony with the en­ vironment. 
Already good job 

Frank Manupelli, president of the 
Greater San Antonio Builders Associa­ tion, reports that a recent survey by the National Association of Home 
Builders Research Foundation shows builders as already doing a good job of building energy-saving homes. 
“ But, whatever the numbers, we know' that the nation’s home builders will be called upon to build homes that require even less energy,” he said. 
Manupelli adds there are dozens of designs and construction features that can be incorporated into new homes to reduce energy consumption. 
Builders know that oversized heating 
- cooling systems cause poor comfort conditions through their lower season­ al efficiency. They also consume more energy. 
Design of the home is another im­ portant requirement. A square house 
- opposed to a rectangular one — does use less energy if all other factors are equal. 
But most experts agree that the greatest home energy savings can be obtained through reduction of air in­ filtration, usually associated with doors and windows, and reduction of conductive heat transfer through walls. 
The loss of heat through windows can be cut in half with the use of double 

CLASSIFIED DISPLAY 

 panes, while new insulation materials and installation techniques are used to stop heat transfer through walls. 

Landscaping is also an important environmental tool for the builder. 
Existing trees are being retained and others planted. In the Summer, their shade blocks out the sun, and, in 
Winter, they act as a wind barrier while allowing the sun through to heat the house. 
Energy factors also pertain to roof­ ing. In warmer climates, a light color material is used to reflect the sun. In cooler regions, flat roofs are becoming more common because accumulated snow is a natural insulation against the cold. 
! 
While the shell of the house is itself becoming more energy efficient, so are those appliances within the home that are the greatest consumers of energy. 
Next come the lighting, refrigerator and color television. All of these ap-1 pliances are now being revised to use! less power. 
As an energy conservation measure,1 the Builders Associations urge use of! gas-fired water heaters, if possible, because of their two burners and the overall efficiencies over single-burner types. 
While the energy crisis is no longer as critical, building experts recognize that energy conservation is a perman­ ent need. Cooling and heating costs will increase in the future as will land and construction costs. 
It may mean tomorrow’s energy- saving home will be smaller, but it will probably be more satisfying to the so­ phisticated consumer because of its cost and energy-saving concepts.

San Antonio EXPRESS NEWS-— Saturday April 16 1977 it 
 home financing sought 

WASHINGTON - By increas­ ing mortgage limits and reduc­ ing down payment requirements under the PHA mortgage insur­ ance programs, the government, could create new home owner­ ship opportunities for thousands of moderate- and middle-income families. 
This proposal was made recently by Robert Arquilla of suburban Chicago, who is president of the National Asso­ ciation of Home Builders (NAUH), be­ fore a House subcommittee bearing of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs. The committee is bearing testimony on bousing authori­ zation legislation for fiscal 1978, which begins Oct. I. 
Arquilla noted that, since the present 
PHA single-family mortgage limit of 
$45,ooo was last increased, the sales 

 price of a typical PT IA home increased ll per cent. He urged Congress to raise the P HA mortgage limit to $6o,ooo. 
PHA down payment requirements also'niust be reduced “ or many fa­ milies will find PHA programs are useless to them, unless they have sub­ stantial cash reserves with which to meet the hefty down payment requirements,’’ he said. HUS has made the same recommendation. 
As far as other housing programs are concerned, at least for the imme­ diate future, NAUH sided with HUD 
Secretary Patricia Harris, who sup­ ports the concept that HUD and Con­ gress work together to implement and fund fully a wide-range of programs already on the hooks, making whatever modifications are necessary to im­ prove their effectiveness. 
The Section 235 program, which subsidizes mortgage interest rates for moderate income families, was de­ scribed by Arquilla as one of the gov­ ernment’s most effective home own-

He supported 
HUD’s proposal for increasing maxi­ mal mortgage limits to make tho pro­ gram more workable. 
Arquilla also recommended that tho 
Brooke-Cranston program, which pro­ vides 7 1 ,2 per rent mortgage money for middle-meome home buyers, be ex­ tended on a stand-by basis so that it could he triggered anytime housing production fell below a certain level. 
“ If such a program had been on the books in 1974, it might have been pos­ sible to prevent things from getting as bad as they did.” Only l l million starts were recorded in 1975, a 3o-year low. 
Arquilla also urged Congress to consider some new subsidy concepts that would assist the millions of young working families, particularly first- time buyers, who have been priced out of the market. 
The national housing situation has been complicated in recent years by inflation pushing up mortgage interest rates and construction costs, along with real estate and other taxes and utility costs, beyond a corresponding increase in family income," lie said. 

“ Thus, the problem of providing housing affordable to millions of low and moderate income families, has escalated into the complex question of providing housing to a whole range of middle-income families unable to af­ ford the median priced home ” 

NAUH has developed a “ Common 
Sense Housing Subsidy Program” to deal with this very problem, he said. If would stimulate construction of 1oo,oo(1 new or rehabilitated units each year in inner city neighborhoods and 3oo,oo(1 units annually in other urban and su­ burban areas. 
Under the proposal, he exp lined, buyers would receive mortgage inter­ est rate subsidies of a maximal 3 prr cent but not to bring the rate below K per cent. The higher the price of the home, the smaller would be the assis-, lance, with a maximal purchase of 
$5o,ooo. 
The government would recapture part of the subsidy upon sale of the home. he said. “ This recapture provision should ultimately result in the program being virtually self-sus­ taining in later years.

Home price rises largely because of many controls 

Frank Manupelli, president of the 
G reater 
San 
Antonio 
Builders Association, reported that unnecessary and often du­ plicating governmental regula­ tions are partly to blame for sharp increases in the price of new homes over the past six years. 
Manupelli said that, because housing costs have increased faster than family income, a “ whole range of middle in­ come fam ilies.” particularly young families trying to buy a home for the* first time, have been priced out of the m arket. The m edian price of new homes actually sold rose from $23,4oo in 197o to $44,2oo in 1976. 
Besides periodic shortages of mort­ gage funds and high interest rates, the other m ajor problem confronting builders attempting to hold down costs is the increasing number of regula­ tions imposed to all levels of govern­ ment, Manupelli said. 
Regulatory controls, he said, are driving up land and land development costs, increasing the number of costly building code features and increasing costs by requiring builders to pay high governmental fees and to hire addi­ tional employes to handle the myriad of paperwork. 
“ Slow growth and no-growth policies imposed by localites have created ar­ tificial shortages of land, thereby 

 driving up the price of raw land.” he said. 

Environmental controls and impact statements also helped push the cost of a typical developed lot from $5,ooo in 
197o, or 2o per cent of the total sales price of a new home, to I976’s price of about $1o,8oo, or about 26 per cent of the sales price. 

A recent study of land development costs in Montgomery County. Md., showed that environmental require­ ments increased costs by $2,227 per lot, 
Manupelli said. 
In Colorado, another study showed that development costs increased between $1,75o and $3,3oo per lot in a five-year period because of increases in water, sewer and permit fees, addi­ tional requirements for school and park land dedications and higher con­ struction standards. 
Construction delays caused by the regulatory review process also in­ crease a builder’s financing and over­ head costs, he said. “ Once a project is started, the builder is obligated for financing and carrying charges and increased overhead costs. 
“ The home building industry has made many significant efforts to at­ tack cost increases through technical improvements and production-line techniques,” he said. “ But, as an in­ dustry, there is only so far we can go before bumping into economic and po­ litical obstacles imposed by govern­ ment at all levels.”

This New Home 
Costs Less Than 
Your Old Home. 

I’m Buddy Burns. And I'd like to shed some licht on your old home. If your home is 
5 years old or older, chances are it's obsolete. 
That's right, obsolete. Be­ cause at the time your home was built, there were virtually no energy-effi- ciency standards. As a result, many San Antonians are faced with utility bills that may soon exceed their house payments! 

Why NOW Is The Time To Buy. 
Let's look at the facts. Since you invested in your home a few years ago, two things have hap­ pened For one, you've been making house payments for sev­ eral years, so your equity has rown. Too, since the cost of uilding a new home has stead­ ily increased, the cost of replac­ ing your home has increased 
BUT, because your old home isn't energy efficient, it wastes valuable energy. Arid believe it or not, homeowners around the country are actually beginning to lose money when they sell their older homes. Because no­ 

 body wants to buy a home where the cost of heating and cooling exceeds the monthly payments. 
My advice is this: With the money you can make by selling your old home right now, you eon probably make the dow n­ payment and move into a new 
Burns Co. Power Saver" home today. And, while your house payments may be a little higher, the lower utility bills should easily offset the difference. The only thing you can't afford to do is wait much longer.

 much to it, especially when the need for modern families to save as much energy as pos­ sible is considered. The 
Snug 
Home accom­ plishes that with ease. 
Energy - saving fea­ tures in 
Homecraft houses actually result in 
“ tight” insulation — not just ample insulation. 
Items included in the 
Snug Home concept are double - paned, solar gray windows, light - re­ sistant with strategic lo­ cations; foil - faced sheathing added to wall insulation to reflect both heat and light; and steel - encased doors with mag­ netic, refrigerator - type weatherstripping. 
Besides its new series of patio homes, a total of six model homes will be showcased in Meadow 
Oaks this weekend. 
These fully furnished, professionally decorated models have caught the interest of many home shoppers looking for a fine house nestled among trees of a neighborhood near all the city conven­ iences 
This is because Mea­ dow' Oaks fits that de­ scription to the fullest. 
Its serenity, combined with convenience, has made it the choice of many families. 
The market - tested floor plans and designs 
U. S. Home offers in this community make up even more reasons for its surge in popularity. 

It is in Meadow Oaks that U. S. Home proudly presents not only its new patio homes but also its two recent Snug Home models and its original four models to fully represent modern hous­ ing available in the neighborhood. 
Just some of the fea­ tures are all - electric, decorator kitchens; fine carpeting; handcrafted, woodburning fireplaces with gas log lighters; and, of course, optimal insulation. 
The choice location of 
Meadow Oaks is still an­ other reason for so many families’ moving there. 
The community is con­ venient to Randolph AFB via N. E. FM 16o4. It is also near the shopping and entertainment faci­ lities of both Universal 
City and northeastern 
San Antonio. 
Also, an amenity area aptly called “ The Oaks” 
Swim and Tennis Club is exclusively for the en­ joyment of Meadow Oaks residents. 

Complete city services, of course, are in Meadow 
Oaks, actually outside 
San Antonio City Limits. 
The community is in the progressive 
Judson 
School District. 
Meadow 
Oaks is reached most easily by exiting from N. E. III 35 to N. E. FM 16o4 and proceeding east to the community’s grand entranceway. 
Henry cites lobby plan 

Reese Henry of San 
Antonio, president of the 
Texas Association of 
Realtors, recently de­ clared in Austin that 
"Realtors dramatically proved their dedication to the protection of home buyers by the strong pressure we put on Con­ gressmen to defeat the common site picketing bill w hich could have re­ sulted in a disastrous amount of added cost to all construction.” 
Henry issued this statement in a meeting with TAR leadership: 
‘Over 35o’ 
‘‘We had over 35o 
Realtors, including al­ most 7o from Texas, in 
Washington lobbying against the bill which would have allowed the closing down of con­ struction projects even if only one subcontractor had a union dispute with the contractor. We saw the common site picket­ ing bill as a real threat to all consumers and espe­ cially potential home- buying families who arc already beset with many inflated costs on every hand. 
‘‘Realtors joined con- 

 tractors and homebuilders fighting this bill. We saw every 
Congressman, and we made our position known loud and clear. The housing industry is al­ ready seriously ham­ pered by ever-rising costs, making the dream of home ownership for thousands of Americans more and more a fantasy rather than a reality. As 
Realtors, we are advo­ cates for the rights of the shelter-seeking public. I am really proud of the effect that we had with 
Congress.” 
In reports by Washing­ ton, D.C. newspapers, the 
House 
Speaker, 
Tip 
O’Neill, was quoted as saying that ‘‘labor had gotten ‘careless’ in its lobbying efforts in recent weeks and that he had never seen organizations lobby as hard as Real­ tors, homebuilders and contractors.” 
Henry led Hie Texas delegation to 
Wash­ ington, which also included Frank Nix of 
Waco, the 1976 TAR pres­ ident, and many other officers. The final vote against the bill was 217 - 
2o5.

Moving needs to be called a fact of life 

By FRANK Z A M PELLI 
PRESEN T. GREATER SJR BUILDERS ASSOCIATION 
Once you’ve decided to buy a new home, the next thing you have to think about is moving. 
Moving is a fact of life for about 
18 per cent of the U. S. popula­ tion that change residences each year. 
Nationally, there are about 12,ooo moving and storage companies. All the interstate carriers are regulated by the 
Interstate Commerce Commission 
(ICO . 
Weight, value 
The cost of interstate and long dis­ tance moves are determined by the weight and value of your household goods and the distance involved, plus any special services, such as packing, unpacking and storage. The cost of local moves usually is determined by a hourly rate. 
Although not a1! movers have the same rates, most of them are compe­ titive. No interstate mover may charge more — or less — than the ICC rates for the services actually provided. 
The distance of your move is easy to determine. But estimating the actual weight of your goods is a lot tougher. 
The weight usually is determined by weighing the moving van before and after loading your shipment. The dif­ ference is the weight of your shipment. 
If requested, the mover is required to give you a written estimate of ap­ proximately what your shipment will weigh and how much it probably will cost you to move. 
Estimates, however, are not binding. 
If the total charges exceed the estimate by more than IO per cent, the mover is required by ICC to deliver your goods upon payment of the estimated charges plus an additional IO per cent. 
You then have 15 working days to pay the balance. 
All interstate carriers are required to furnish customers with an ICC booklet titled “ Summary of Informa­ tion for Shippers of Household Goods.” 
This booklet explains some of the “ do’s and don’ts” of moving. Among the points it contains: 
•You can save money by doing your own packing and unpacking. You should use strong containers which can be obtained from outside sources or purchased from the mover. 
•Do not pack money, jewelry or im­ portant papers. The mover may not be liable for valuable personal items. 
•VV hen the mover arrives to pick up your goods, the driver or someone representing the moving company will

 make an inventory of all the articles to be shipped. Notations regarding the condition of your furniture are usually entered on the inventory code explained at the top of the form. If at all possible, you or someone you can rely upon should be present while this inventory is being prepared. Before signing the inventory, note on it, by item number, any exceptions you may have as to the condition descriptions. 
•During the pickup, the mover will give you a bill of lading. This serves as a receipt for your goods. It also in­ cludes the weight of the truck before the pickup. Make sure that the place of delivery is shown correctly and that the bill of lading contains the name, address and telephone number where you or some other party can be notified of costs and delays while your goods are in transit. 
• Plan to be at your new home or apartment on or before the delivery date. The mover is required to wait only three hours for you to accept your goods, and less time or none at all if your move is under 2oo miles. If the mover is unable to contact you within the free waiting time, he will place your goods in storage and you will have to pay additional storage and redeli­ very charges. 
•When the unloading begins, check off each item on the inventory as it comes off the van or into your house. If something is missing or damaged, point it out to the driver and mark it on your copy of the inventory. Upon com­ pletion of the delivery, the driver will ask you to sign the delivery charges. 
•Interstate movers are not liable for the full value of lost or damaged goods unless you pay an additional charge for such protection. Protection of up to 6o cents a pound is all you get free. For example, a broken lamp, weighing four pounds, would be worth $2.4o under this coverage. 
•If you wish to be paid full value for lost or damaged items, you must de­ ciare a lump sum value for the entire shipment and pay an extra charge de­ pending on the value you declare. 
•The IGC requires a mover to answer a claim within 3o days. How­ ever, the ICC has no power to deter­ mine the amount of damages that should be paid, or even if the mover should be obliged to pay. 
• Keep records of all moving ex­ penses. Most of them are tax deducti­ ble up to a total of $2,5oo. Valid de­ ductions include house hunting trips before the move, moving expenses, temporary living expenses and fees incurred for buying, selling or leasing a residence. Deductions now apply to individuals changing employers.

New training office begun by Deanie Owens 

Robert E. Owens Sr., president of 
Deanie 
Owens Co., Realtors, has announced the opening of the company’s new com­ mercial real estate and employes training offices at 8526 N. New Braunfels 
Ave. 
Owens also announced a new company sales re­ cord for March with total sales volume in excess of 
$14 million. 
Part of plan 

The new offices are part of the company’s master plan for in­ creased commercial real estate development as well as for housing the continuing educational program for real estate sales training. 

Owens noted, “ Our committment to the pub­ lic and real estate in­ dustry, as a whole, has dictated that we, as well as other Realtors, main­ tain a high educational level for our agents. 
Anything less than this is short-changing the consumer. 
“ By providing daily classes for our people, we have a better outlook on the always - changing real estate market in 
South Texas. That’s a plus for the customer.” 
Commenting on the 

 company’s record sales effort, he observed, “ Our success can be der.ved from a very agressive sales force that we have provided with the tools they need to sell: a trustworthy reputation, education and an exciting promotional advertising campaign.” 

Owens took particular notice of the company’s new North Central Office at 1o13 N.W. Loop 41o which set an individual office sales record for the 
3o - day period ending 
March 31. The office achieved a sensational 77 residential sales, pro­ ducing a volume of more than $4 million. The of­ fice is owned by Jerry 
Holloway and 
Phil 
Grubbs; 
Grubbs is manager. 

Owens also recognized the 1oo3 N.E. Loop 41o office, managed by Mrs. 
Lou Bond, with sales of more than $2 million; and the 1142 Austin Highway office with more than $1 million in sales. The 
Austin Highway office is owned and managed by 
Bob Bueker and Ron 
Chapman.

Success in growing decorative plants in the home probably depends as much on good judg­ ment in selecting the plants as on skill in caring for them. 
First, decide why you want house plants. Do you want them only for de­ corative accessories? Or are you in­ terested in growing and tending the plants as well as displaying them? 
Decorative effect 
If you want plants only as decorative accessories, select them for their ap- pearance.Get healthy, well-formed plants near the size you need for de­ corative effect. Water the plants regu­ larly until their appearance becomes unsatisfactory; then, replace them with new plants. 
If you are interested in growing house plants and keeping them in good condition year after year, you must) decide how much attention you can give them. Are you able, or willing, to adapt some part of your home to the needs of the house plants? Or, would you rather restrict your choice of plants to those that tolerate an envir­ onment comfortable to people in the home? This is probably the wisest. 
Plants that tolerate low humidity do well in the 4o to 5o per cent relative humidity usually found in heated or air conditioned homes; however, this is too dry for many plants. 
Ways you can raise the humidity for plants needing medium humidity in­ clude: 

•Keeping plants where the humidity is highest, such as the kitchen, parti­ cularly above the sink, which is nor­ mally more humid than the rest of the home; 
•Grouping plants together; air sur­ rounding grouped plants usually is more humid than air around a single plant; 
•Setting plants above a tray of gravel, sand or peat moss that is kept wet; and 
•Installing supplemental humidi­ fiers and humidistats in your heating or air conditioning systems. 
When potting or repotting plants, use containers that have a drainage hole in the bottom. Watertight pots are diffi­ cult to care for properly; water tends to collect in the bottom of the pot and injure the plant roots. 
When roots of a plant fill the con­ tainer, the plant stops growing. For the plant to resume vigorous growth, you must repot it in a larger container of fresh soil.. 
Often, it is desirable for a house plant to stop growing. If the plant is as large as you want it. to be, do not repot it. Instead, remove some of the top soil at least once a year and replace it with fresh soil. 
Newly purchased plants don’t have to be repotted immediately; their con­ tainers usually are satisfactory. 
Avoid overwatering. This is the most

 common cause of trouble in growing house plants. 
No general rule applies to the wa­ tering of all house plants. Some do best if the soil is kept moist; others, if the soil is allowed to dry moderately between waterings. 
Plants grown in the house during the 
Winter can be moved outdoors for the 
Summer, The best location outdoors for the plants depends on the amount of sunlight they can tolerate. If plants do well in direct sunlight, set them in the open. If they need diffused sun­ light, place them under trees or tall shrubs where they will get a mixture of sunshine and shade. If the need sub­ dued daylight, keep the plants on a shady porch. 
Plants kept in pots outdoors need more frequent watering than they do indoors. 
To m aintain plants through the 
Summer with minimal care, sink the pots in the ground in the flower beds up to their rims. Lift or twist the pots once a month to prevent the roots from growing through the drainage hole. 
Before the nights become uncomfor­ tably cool in Autumn, lift the plants and repot them, if necessary. If they are diseased or infested with insects, do not return them to the house. 
If house plants have the proper amount of water and heat for good growth but not enough light, they tend to grow long and spindly. Often, planters are used as decorating acces­ sories in locations not lighted well en­ ough for good plant growth; however, foliage plants can be acclimated to lew light intensities. 
To grow house plants successfully in little or no daylight, water the plants only often enough to prevent wilting; reduce the amount of fertilizer you apply to the plants; keep the air tem­ perature as cool as you can tolerate; and provide supplementary lighting with fluorescent tubes. 
Double pot plants to be g iw n under artificial light. This makes soil mois­ ture control easier than leaving the pot exposed to the air.

The POWER of FAITH 

By W O O D I ISH M A EL 

THE BIBLE 

No. 287. A Prayer o f Triumph 

Although a considerable portion of the prophecy of Habakkuk chronicled the corruption and infidelity of the people, he was firmly aware of God s power and sovereignty: “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him." (Habakkuk 2:2o) 
“O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known, in wrath remember mercy. God came from leman, and the 
Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise." (Habakkuk 3:2-3) 
The prophet concluded his lyrical prayer in a triumphant manner. 
“Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. The 
Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places" (Habakkuk 3:18-19)

More important issues facin g legislature 

The Texas House Com­ mittee on Integrgovern- mental Affairs held its hearing on the proposal to legalize racetrack gambling on a local op­ tion basis in Texas this week. 
The hearing is a mi­ crocosm of the argu­ ments and struggles that have been taking place in 
Texas over the last se­ veral years on the issue of whether to open the state to gambling. 
State after state has fallen into that pattern so that the concentrated ef­ forts of wealthy sports­ men and gambling inter­ est have centered on 
Texas. 

Hoopla 
The hearing had the hoopla of gambling de­ votees coming to demon­ strate their enthusiasm for their request. 
Testimony included horse farm people who were seeking to convince legislators that they were good and substantial people. (This question never was an issue with the opponents of the idea.) 
An ex-Baptist pastor from Kentucky was im­ ported to tell about his support for racetrack gambling though he con­ fessed he had never gambled. 
Opponents to the idea had testimony from the ex-FBI man who headed the Organized Crime Di­ vision telling how the gambling atmosphere of legalization increased the illegal gambling. 
People with memories back to the time the tracks were operative in our state told of economic distress by the poor ele­ ments of the community who placed their hope in the betting process. 
The committee voted overwhelmingly to place 

Rev. ___ 
Jiminy R. Allen 
Pallor. 
First Baptist Church 

 the issue in subcom­ mittee where opponents are hoping it will die. 
No one wins 
The sad element in the picture is that no one wins. 
Observers either praise or condemn Bap­ tists for their opposition to the legalizing of gam­ bling as if they were the only ones who were con­ cerned about its effect on the community. 
Wealthy sportsmen in­ dignantly disclaim any relationship with crime or an increased criminal atmosphere. 
Emotions are stirred. 
Arguments are made and refuted. 
The energy and effort that is necessary to deal with this issue could well have been invested in the legislative process in far more positive ways. 

Urbanized 
Texas is an increas­ ingly urbanized state. 
There are educational problems, criminal jus­ tice problems, mental health problems, health maintenance problems, economic development problems. 
These need our highest and best attention. They are positive challenges to citizens. 
The energy of our state needs to be turned in those directions rather 

 than in having to stave off the pressures of a minority of persons who have profit to make in preferential legislation. 
Our communities need to be built with solid work oriented industries. 
The easy dollar always costs too much. 
It is to be hoped that our attention can be fo­ cused on solving the real problems of our state in aggressive programs. 
In a time of gargantuan challenge to the spiritual and moral well being of our state, it is immoral for us to be forever dealing with Lilliputian issues.

Other counties warned of possible flooding in­ cluded Bandera, Blanco, 
Burnet, Travis, Lampa­ sas, Williamson and 
Gillespie. 

Winds across the state were generally east to southeasterly at five to IO miles per hour, but some gusty winds were report­ ed in the Corpus Christi area.

Measles increase but not epidemic 

Measles are increasing in San Antonio but have not reached epidemic le­ vels, city health officials said Friday. 
Dr. Robert Bell, direc­ tor of communicable dis­ ease control for the San 
Antonio Metropolitan 
Health District, said the number of measles cases is exceeding what would normally be considered a seasonal increase. 
Health district records show 99 cases of measles 
(rubiola-type) and six cases of rubella reported here for this year through April 8. 
The number of military personnel with measles is 61 cases of the rubio­ la-type measles and 37 cases of rubella. 
Dr. Bell said the in­ crease indicates an im­ properly immunized population. He said the health department is now working with kindergar­ tens to immunize pre­ schoolers. 
The figures on the measles increase reflect reports by private physi-( cians, hospitals and school districts. 
They do not include fi­ gures from such cities as 
Alamo Heights and Ol­ mos Park which main­ tain their own health de­ partments, Dr. Bell said. 
Dr. Bell said there were no cases of rubiola or rubella reported dur­ ing the comparable per­ iod of time last year.

Rainfall needs told 

AUSTIN 
(AP) 
- 
Fields and pastures throughout the High 
Plains need at least two inches of rain to really change the drought si­ tuation in West Texas, 
Agriculture Commis­ sioner Reagan Brown said Friday. 

“ Wheat is at a critical stage throughout the 
West Texas region and even the recent showers will be a help,” Brown said. “ There has not been enough to provide deep moisture, but an­ 

 other front is expected to move in soon.” 
Reagan said that the heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes that moved through Central Texas and the 
Blacklands 
Thursday night did not cause any reported ser­ ious damage to farmers and ranchers.

Grant claimants to m eet today 

Between 311o and 4oo heirs to Spanish land grants in 
Texas will gather here Saturday to press their claims for payment by the Mexican government. 
The group, led by land grant activist Reies Lopez 
Tijerina, will meet at the Assumption Seminary, 
26oo Woodlawn Ave., to prepare proof of their claims. 
The meeting is intended to clear the way for negotiations with the Mexican government for direct payments to the land grant heirs. 

Tijerina is basing the claim on a 1941 treaty between the U.S. and Mexico on old land grant claims estimated to be in excess of $4oo million. 

Tijerina said Mexican President Jose Lopez 
Portillo has agreed to honor the 27-year-old treaty and establish payments to heirs of 431 Spanish land grants in Texas. 

Tijerina said he met with Lopez Portillo and 
Santiago Reel, minister of the Mexican .State De­ partment. last January agreed in which they to settle the outstanding land grant claims. 

A spokesman for the Mexican government, how­ ever, said Tijerina met with the minister of foreign relations last January but was not authorized to represent Mexico in the claims.

“Sometimes I think men are like hens — the older they get. the bigger the eggs they lay.” — Frank A. Clark. th e re were a couple of large eggs laid in the play of today s tricky slam 
Tw o grown men suffered a blind spot and played in the same hurried way. And after the hand was down one, the only ones that could afford to cluck were the grateful oppo­ nents. 
In a team gam e, both declarers reached six spades and the king of hearts was led in each room. Seeing two im ­ m ediate parking places for the two small hearts, both d e clarers quickly won the heart ace, cashed a diamond king, led a spade to dummy's ace and then played the ace and queen of diamonds to dis­ pose of the losing hearts. 
West ru ffed ru d e ly and wonder of wonders, the spade king was the setting trick 
An unlucky developm ent and both had reason to blush. 
The lam e excuse was. “ I couldn’t afford to take the spade finesse. Had it lost, I would have gone down im ­ m ediately.” 
On the surface this e x ­ planation seems fair enough. nut a little more thought would have been better than any explanation The truth is that declarer didn t have to commit himself in spades so early Discarding his hearts on the diamonds was correct, but he should have retained his options in the play of the trum p suit. 
Correct (and winning) play is to win the heart ace and 
•lay the king of diamonds A 
Jew club to dummy’s queen provides a convenient entry and dum m y’s ace and queen o f diam o nd s are p la y e d , d e c la re r d is c a rd in g both hearts. West ruffs unexpec­ tedly but the hand is not over.

24.oo. from a collection of hot ideas for summer. junior shop, downtown and north star mall. 

The Conservation Society is throw­ ing a four-day costume party next week and everyone is invited. 

The annual Night in Old San Antonio festivities begin at 5:3o p.m. Tuesday and continue through Friday. Gates will close at IO p.m. nightly—after more than 2o,ooo revelers have passed through the streets of La Villita. 

From Dutch shoes to Mexican lace dresses, the costumes worn to NIOSA will accent the numerous ethnic areas and foods which characterize the cele­ bration. 
Most workers will come wearing costumes, and participants are urged to dress for the event. 
Produced by volunteers from the 
Conservation Society, NIOSA is not only a place to party, but also a back­ drop to look at the city’s ethnically rich history. 

The sounds of mariachis juxtaposed with the honky-tonk piano of the Gay 
9os and the footstool ping of a Western band within earshot of the strains of 
Dixieland jazz all underline the li­ festyles of old San Antonio. 

More than 1oo,ooo persons are expected—from 
2o,ooo-25,ooo each night. If this year is true to form, even warm beer or cold tamales won’t keep 
Fiesta enthusiasts away. 

One year a 45-minute rain in the midst of the festivities didn’t dampen spirits. No one went home. Another year, NIOSA was staged under a hur­ ricane threat..but the show went on. 

Advance tickets are now available for $2.5o at all H EB and Handy Andy 
Stores and most downtown hotels. 
Tickets at the gate are $3 and children under 12 are 5o cents. 
All proceeds go to the Conservation 
Society, which is observing its 53rd year of service to San Antonio. 

General chairman of NIOSA is Mrs. 
William E. Parrish.

Pi­ 

 ton were married April 
IB. 1927, in New Braun­ fels. 

Mrs. Pennington is the former Margie Schnnert of Bandera and Comfort. 
Her husband is a native of Pineland. They have resided in San Antonio since their marriage. 

The couple has four grandchildren. 

Latin America buffs can take a mini vacation to their favor­ ite countries—and stay right here in San Antonio. 
Le Meson Latino at 38o2 Broadway 
(an Argentine restaurant was in that location formerly) is offering spe­ cialties from Colombia. Argentina, 
Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean Islands and Peru. 
Owner Nelson Arcila, w ho came here from Colombia eight years ago and has worked in other San Antonio restaur­ ants, says the menu is temporary, as he is experimenting to see what his customers want. 
I suggested he was becoming a little 
TOO Americanized when he added chicken fried steak to the luncheon menu, but he insists on bowing to the wishes of his clientele. 
But back to his Latin specialties! 
Paella 

Paella ($14.95 for two). Churrasco 
Argentino ($4.95), red snapper (fried for $4.35 or filet for $3.95), and shrimp 
(in casserole for $5.25 or with rice for 
$4.95) are the most popular with Arci- la’s customers who are “ half and half” 
American and Latin, he says. 
Another attraction is his version of ceviche (with fish. $2; with shrimp, 
$2.5o). 
Arcila does most of the cooking him­ self but is training employes to take over so he can spend more time in the front of the house. 
We met him after having dinner at his relatively new restaurant which is casually elegant and has surprisingly formal service. 
In fact, Le Meson Latino is romanti­ cally dark (hadn’t held hands in a restaurant in a long time!) with hurri­ cane candles for reading the menu and 
Latin music in the background.

Appetizer 

We ordered the shrimp ceviche for an appetizer and enjoyed this lime-cooked shellfish in a gazpacho-like “ soup.” 
For the main course, my husband had the Churrasco which includes flank steak served with an ompanada (a meat-filled pastry turnover), fried po­ 

 tatoes and the inevitable rice. 
I chose the sweetbreads ($2.95,), one of the few varietal meats that I enjoy. 
These are sliced thin then broiled over charcoal with a basting of chimishurri sauce (olive oil with seasonings such as parsley and garlic). 
It was more than just a nice change from the steaks and seafood routine. I was reminded of eating my first sweetbreads (with wine and cream sauce, I believe) in the Blue Room of the Roosevelt Hotel, New Orleans. 
Each entree is served with a tossed salad with house dressing (be sure to specify if you prefer the dressing on the side), and we had a half carafe of rose wine. 
Dessert time 
For dessert, we ordered bananas a la mode and cups of the restaurant’s strong coffee. 
The bananas appeared to have been 
. sauteed in butter and brown sugar with some sweet spices. Vanilla ice cream was served on the side. 
Next time, I’ll try the guava with cheese—a dessert I haven’t had since dining in a Cuban home several years ago. 
And for dinner, I II have paella, of course. 
Luncheon specials include chopped sirloin, enchiladas, filet of sole and the chicken fried steak, each for $2.25. A 
9-ounce T-bone steak is $3.95. 
And you can select wines from Ar­ gentina, Italy, Spain, France and Cali­ fornia. 
Le Meson Latino is open from 11:3o a.m. to 2:3o p.m. for lunch and from 
5:3o to 1o:3o p.m. for dinner every day except Tuesday. 
Saturdays and Sundays, the restaur­ ant is open all day, 11:3o a.m. to 1o:3o p.m.

Ole for Spanish soap 

A hostess gift. that does double or triple duty is especially welcome. A fine, perfumed soap is one of life’s little luxuries that fall into this cate­ gory. 
It adds lingering fra­ grance to cleansing ac­ tion. And, because it is hard milled, it will out­ last an ordinary bar. 

A romantic import from Barcelona has all of this to offer and another unique benefit as well. 
Since it is formulated with pure Spanish olive oil, it is also an excellent skin treatment 
— a smoothing emollient for dry and sensitive skin. 

It makes a delightful gift, exotically boxed and deliciously scented. 

Lovelier' 
..You 
M A R Y SUE MILLER 

And here are tips for uses other than the basic one. Place unwrapped bars in your lingerie and glove drawers. 

This leaves them with a lasting scent, and the soap is still ready for use. 
Linens are their closets are made fragrant by an open box of soap placed between sheets and towels. 

Try to keep your soap 

 and bath cologne in the same family. That way, each product strengthens the overall effect. Like a hill of Spanish flowers on an April morning. 

Traveling 
Lovelies should always tuck a fra­ grant snap in their lug­ gage. Nothing like it so sweetens a hotel room, your wardrobe, your bath and your skin. For so lit­ tle weight, cost and ef­ fort.

The wedding hell blues 

Dear Ann Landers: Six years ago my father divorced my mother to marry another wo­ man. Mom was very bitter and angry. 
The intervening years have met Inwed Mom and she now even speaks to my stepmother on the phone. My stepmother is a terrific person and it would be hard not to like her. 
The problem: I am about to become engaged to a wonderful fellow. While my parents are happy to give me a big wed­ ding. my motlier is reluctant to take part in the festivities if my stepmother is invited. 
I love my mom and can un­ derstand her feelings, but I al­ so lov e my dud and Ins second wife. I want both Mom and my stepmother to attend tin* bridal showers, tin* prenuptial dinner and the wedding. 
My stepmother says she would be happy to attend any and all events, but my mother says I am being unrealistic to expect both her and my step­ mother to participate. 
Please help me handle this delicate situation properly. — 
In The Middle 

Dear Middle: Some dumped senct 

 w iv es do not mind it their hus­ bands' second wives show up at the saint1 parties — or even the weddings of their children. 
Others do. 
A person of taste would not invite both her mother and stepmother to the same shower or party unless she knew for certain that neither would mind. Since you know your mother WOULD mind, she should be given preference. 
If your stepmother is as 
“ terrific” as you say, she will have the grace and common sense to stay away from the prenuptial dinner and the wed­ ding w hen she is told how your mother feels about her pre- 

Dear Ann: 
Our 21-year-old son and his wife (age 18 and a nice girl) appear at our door every weekend with their over­ night bags. 

They just assume we want them and never bother to ask if we have other plans. I notice you have a booklet entitled 
“ Bugged By Parents? How To 
Get More Freedom.” Maybe you should write another one and call it 
“ Bugged 
By 
Children? How To Get More 
Freedom.” 

Hinting doesn’t work. They don't get the idea. What can we do without offending them? — 
L V S . 

Dear L.A.S.: Obviously this 
18-year-old girl and her 
21-year-old husband are not grown up enough to be on their own so they hang around 
“ home.” Too bad they were in such a rush to get married. 
Tell your son that from now on he and his wife should make other plans for their weekends because you and Dad would like some time lo yourselves. Say, 
“ W e'll invite you when ifs convenient.” Then do .so. 

Dear Ann Landers: You have published several letters by homosexuals and responded to them with great restraint and 
(in my opinion) too much com­ passion. 

Why don’t you ever print a letter from a lesbian? They must w rite, too, and there must be a large number around. — 
C lose Daily Reader 
Dear Close: Lesbians A R E homosexuals. My advice would not be different for a female homosexual than fur a male. I have published several leters from writers who identified themselves as lesbians. Are you sure you’re a “ Daily 
Reader” ? 

Parents, what should you do if your teen-ager is having sexual relations? 
Ann 
Landers’s new booklet, “ High 
School Sex and How to Deal 
With It — A Guide for Teens and Their Parents,” gives no-nonsense advice on how to handle this delicate situation. 
For each booklet, send 51) cents in coin plus a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope to Ann Landers, care of The Express, Box 2171. San 
Antonio, Tex. 78297.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Saturday April ! 6 1977 

APR "MAY X J U N I J U [ J AUG X SEP I PCT A 
M A R 

MONDAY - A low volume rally that began on the final trading day of the previous week, continued on Monday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 5.22 points on relatively light trading volume of 17,65o,ooo shares. 
Business news included three bullish items: retail sales rose 2.4 per cent in 
March, new car sales were up 14 per cent in March and an agreement had been reached between United Steel­ workers and the IO major steel com­ panies. 
TUESDAY - The DJIA had its big­ gest gain in six months, turning in a robust gain of 13.o6 points to close at 
937.16. This was its best gain since Oct. 
13, 1976, when the day’s gain was 15.95. 
All bullish facets were in gear. In the whole market, advances led decliners by 1,192 to 312. Of the 15 most active issues, all were up and seven were Dow industrials. Of the 3o Dow stocks in the average, 29 were up with one (Sears) closing unchanged. Volume perked up, totalling 23.76 million shares. The 
N YSE index turned in its best gain of the year — up o.68, closing at 54.41. 
WEDNESDAY - The Dow was down nearly 8 points in morning trading. 
Uncertainty over President Carter s proposed energy program (to be an­ nounced next week) was thought to be a deterrent on the market. Prices improved in the afternoon and the Dow industrials posted a final tick of plus 
1.o2. In the market as a whole, ad­ vances ran 41 per cent, declines 32 per 

 cent and unchanged 27 per cent. Vo­ lume continued good at 21.8 million shares. 
THURSDAY - Trading volume on the 
NY Exchange at 3o,49o.ooo shares was the highest for any day in 1977. Presi­ dent Carter’s withdrawal of the $5o tax rebate was received as a stimulus to the market. Many individual stocks had delayed openings on upside gaps. 
The chart pattern showed the Dow making an upside gap. The average at its best was up 13 points. Profit taking cut the gain on the day to 8.82. 
FRIDAY 
— The market stretched the number of advancing days to six, the most consecutive gaining session in 1977. The Dow eked out a rise of o.76. 
Some brokers said they found few surprises in President Carter’s news conference on anti-inflation to effect market action. 

SUMMARY 
— The Dow Jones In­ dustrial Average had its best weekly gain in 14 months, advancing 28.88 points. This was the best gain since the week ending Feb. 2o, 1976, when the gain was 29.44. 

RANGE — High was made on 
Thursday at 956.o7. Low was made on 
Monday at 916.47. Close, Friday, 
947.76. Gain on the week, 28.88. Vo­ lume, all shares traded on the NYSE, 
113.93 million shares. 

ANALYSIS BY CHARLES E CARDEN 
Hem isphere sugar sales attractive 

The world sugar mar­ ket featured a parade of attractive sales by Wes­ tern Hemisphere pro­ ducers in celebration of the Easter holiday. 
When futures were trading around the 9.8o cent per pound level prior to * the holiday weekend, the Dominican 
Republic announced she would not be selling her goods below ten cents. 
Then, in fact, a cargo of Dominican sugar was purchased by a London operator at IO.2o cents 
“ number eleven terms” futures obliged by hoist­ ing themselves into the four digit figures for the first time in almost six months. 
To follow this con­ structive event. Peru, 
Barbodos, St. Kitt, and for a second time, the 
.Dominican 
Republic, 

 sold tonnages of raw su­ gar amounting to about 
1oo,ooo tonnes for ten cents or more. 
The market spent, the week getting itself com­ fortable at its new ten cent level, and appears to be optimistically looking forward to events which might even make this le­ vel a springboard for further action. 
The 
United 
States delegation to the UNC­ 
TAD-sponsored talks on a new international sugar agreement leaves for 

Geneva this weekend. lf such an agreement is successful!v negot ia ted in its six week duration, we might see a minimum price for sugar of ten cents or more which will be defended by the pooling of surpluses if prices appear to be slip­ ping. 
The U.S. also issued a rather bullish looking 
7.5-million tonne esti­ mate of the Soviet sugar beet crop which com­ pares to around nine million tonnes estimated 

Mart has best week in year 

NEW YORK (A P) - 
The stock market closed out its best week in more than a year with a small gain in reduced trading 
Friday. 
Analysts said the pace of the advance slowed as traders shifted their at­ tention toward the energy program 
President 
Carter is scheduled to propose next week. 
The Dow .Jones average of 3o industrial stocks drifted through the day, closing with a .76 gain at 
947.76. 
That left the average with a 28.88-point gain for the week— its best week­ ly showing since it rose 
29.44 points Feb. 17-2o of last year. 
Gainers just barely outnumbered losers in the over-all tally on the 
New York Stock Ex ­ change. 
Volume on the N YSE dropped off to 2o.23 mil­ lion shares from Thurs­ day’s four-month high of 
3o.49 million.

Chrysler recalls vehicles 

DETROIT 
(AP) 
- 
Chrysler 
Corp. is recalling 2,678 of its 1977 four-wheel-drive vehicles because of a potentially faulty axle which could allow' a front wheel to fall off, the auto maker an­ nounced Friday. 
Affected by the recall are Plymouth Trail Dus­ ter, Dodge Ramcharger and light duty trucks. 

Chrysler said about six per cent of the vehicles are suspected of having front driving axles con­ taining improperly ma­ chined wheel spindle shafts. 
The defects may keep the wheel hub and bear­ ings from seating properly, thus causing a hub fracture which would allow' a front wheel to come loose, the firm said. 

 ed to cost about $7 mil­ lion, with the rest of the money going for research and development, the utility said. The plant will be built at Shenan­ doah, about 25 miles southwest of Atlanta’s 
Hartsfield airport, and should be completed by the end of this year.

 fact that Carter stuck proval of the President’s decision this week to withdraw his proposal for a $5o-a-person rebate. 
Many analysts in the financial community had criticized the plan as un­ necessary and potentially inflationary. 
There was also some favorable reaction to the with his position against - wage-price controls in 

 his anti-inflation mes­ sage Friday morning. 
But brokers said the focus of attention ap­ peared to be turning to next week's long-awaited energy message. 
Technical analysts also pointed out that the mar­ ket appeared to face a so-called resistance level at 95o in the Dow after its sharp runup since late last week. 

Standard & Poor’s in­ dex of 4oo industrials rose .o4 to 112.17, and 
S&P’s 5oo-stock compo­ site index was up .o4 at

Et at 57Vg as of the 4 p.m. close of the Big Board.

Other auto issues de­ clined fractionally, and oil stocks were mixed. 
Carter’s energy program is expected to call for measures to discourage gasoline consumption.

LO P picked up 44 to 
16%. 
The company reported sharply higher first quarter operating 

 profits and raised its dividend.

Olympia will contest suit 

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS-NEWS 
OLYM PIA, Wash. - 
Olympia Brewing Co. 
President Rick Schmidt 
Friday described a com­ petitor’s lawsuit seeking to restain the marketing of Olympia Gold as a light beer as totally without merit. 
Miller Brewing Co., a subsidiary of 
Philip 
Morris, Inc., filed a suit 
Monday in U.S. District 

Court asking for a per­ manent injunction prohi­ biting Olympia from us­ ing the light beer desig­ nation. 
“ We believe the Miller lawsuit is totally without merit and we will contest the matter with full con­ fidence that the courts will agree,” Schmidt said. 
Olympia Gold was in­ troduced in January as a 

 product with half the calories of the company’s regular beer. 
Schmidt said all other light beers currently on the market, including 
Miller’s, are advertised as having a third fewer calories than their regu­ lar beers. 
Olympia has been run­ ning a series of television commercials inviting customers to “ choose the 

 right light” featuring a side-by-side comparison of Olympia Gold and 
Miller Lite. 
The suit contends 
Miller bought “ Lite” as a trademark in 1972 and as a result has the right to prevent all others from using "light” as a desig­ nation for low' calorie malt beverage products. 
Schmidt said the word 
“ light” has been used by 

Olympia in connection with its beer products at least since 1913, long be­ fore Miller began using 
“ Lite.”

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Saturday April 16 1977 
S.A. Livestock 
Resolution on Year 811 ^hs toxics asked 
And Lows 

The San Antonio Man­ ufacturers Assn. Friday urged City Council to in­ sist on maximum local enforcem ent of toxic technology standards. 
The association asked council to approve by re­ solution the maximum local control offered by 
Option III shown in the 
Feb. 22 Federal Register. 
The Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act 
Amendments of 1972 dir­ ect the Environmental 
Protection Agency ad­ ministrator to establish pretreatment standards for industrial waste dis­ charges into publicly owned treatment works. 
Proposed rules govern­ ing promulgation of pre­ treatment standards for 
21 industries and focus­ ing on 65 toxic pollutants have been published in 

 the register by the EPA. 
The EPA has invited w ritten input for g u i­ dance in selecting an agency to enforce the proposed standards. 

San Antonio, a ho- merule city, has estab­ lished an industrial waste ordinance regulat­ ing discharges to the publicly owned treat­ ment works and has es­ tablished m onitoring, analytical and enforce­ ment procedures. 
The association feels 
San Antonio has the per­ sonnel with required ex­ pertise to determ ine what strength and quan­ tity of industrial wastes may be discharged to the treatment plants and the 
San Antonio River with­ out violating any of the 
EPA constraints.

The Greater San Antonio Chamber of 
Commerce will survey more than 2oo bu­ sinesses in coming months to insure an oversupply of skilled labor in one particular field does not occur. 
The Chamber’s Vocational Advisory Board will conduct the survey to assure future high school and technical school graduates will not be unemployed in five years. 
“The board will compile the data and transform it into meaningful statistics which will then be made 
Tower urges U.S., 
M exico cooperation 

EDINBURG 
(AP) - 
Sen. 
John 
Tower, 
R- 
Tex., said 
Friday the united States should work with Mexico in try­ ing to alleviate the prob­ lems of illegal aliens and the peso devaluation, which permeates the Rio 
Grande Valley. 

“It is presumptions for us to tell our friends across the border how to run their b u sin ess,” 
Tower told a gathering of about 
15o at the 
Associated City-County 
Economic 
Development 
Corp. (ACCEDE). “ I ex­ pect to cooperate with 
Sen. (Lloyd) Benison in helping to solve these 

 pressing problems. 

Tower delivered a six- m inute speech to the group, which also in­ cluded state Sen. Raul 
Longoria and several 
Valley mayors. 

In a spirited question and answer session . 
Tower responded to queries concerning the flow of illegal aliens across the Rio Grande, the Carter Administra­ tion’s position on public works legislation and his own,views on federal aid and the “pressing un­ employment situation in this area.” 

 available to all area schools for consideration in their training programs,” said chairman L.D. Van 
Doozer. 
He said the project will assist both business and industry in finding what kinds of skilled labor will be needed. 
If the survey shows that in five years San Antonio will have an abundance of diesel mechanics but will need truck drivers, the various schools and counse­ lors will have the information to train students to meet the demand. Van Doozer said. 
Companies selected for participation in the pro­ gram range in size from fifty to 5oo employes and include manufacturers, contract construction, tran­ sportation, communications, utilities and insurance firms. 
The survey will also include wholesale and retail operations, finance and real estate businesses as well as service organizations and government. 
It will embrace the entire San Antonio-Bexar 
County metroplex instead of any one specific geo­ graphical area, Van Doozer said. 
“ This is just one example of the efforts by the 
Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce to pro­ vide more jobs for more people and improve the quality of life for all San Antonians.”

Aluminum panels hit U.S. car line 

SPtCIAl TO THI tXPRtSS NEWS 
DETROIT. Mich. — For the first time, a full-line, mass-produced American pas­ senger car will utilize a major aluminum panel application, according to I. Donald 
Shircliff, Vice President of Reynolds 
Metals Company. 
Sh ircliff said Lineoln-Mereury Di­ vision's new Versailles will feature an all-aluminum hood. 
"For the aluminum industry, this is a real breakthrough." he noted. 
“ While last year one car line utilized an aluminum inner panel, and Ibis year Hic 

 same car is using aluminum inner and outer hood panels for hoods on cars sold in 
California only, the Versailles is the first mass-produced car to list* a significant aluminum body sheet application on all its cars." lie said. 
“ One of the chief reasons Ford Motor

Plant tours aren ’t what many expect 

SPtCIAl TO THt EXPRESS NEWS 
Many people believe working in an auto plant is a form of modern slavery, but a large percentage of the 2o.ooo visitors to the Cadillac plant in Detroit last year were surprised to find that isn t true. 

Although tours through the Cadillac plant had been conducted sporadically for many years* the management decided t ii pee years ago to set up a regular twice-daily schedule of personalize*, lours. 

“ Many people seem to have precon­ ceived notions of what the job will be like.” said Gary dosyfoycz, Cadillac's lour corordinator. “ And those notions for the most part are not very good. 

“ I'he reaction that we see from a great m any people is surprise at the fact things arc better than they had been led to believe. 

Enjoy their work 

“ The workers are not necessarily being rushed and hounded by their supervisors. 
They are not angry men working on the line. The vast majority seem to enjoy what they're doing and tend to do a gen­ erally good job.” Josyfoycz said. 

The best known auto tours in the country are undoubtedly those through the Ford Rouge. They attract many thou­ sands of visitors each year and they also expose people to steel-making and other production operations that aren't strictly automotive. 

Cadillac's tours, which begin at 9:3o a.m. and 1:3o p.m., are usually restricted to groups of IO persons. The tours last for about 9o minutes, although they some­ times art* much longer when there are lots of questions. 

V isitors walk within IO or la feet of the production line and often ask questions of lilt* foremen on the line. 

Automotive Information Council esti­ mates 85 per cent of the plant visitors are from out of the Detroit area. 
People visiting Detroit who want to tour oil auto plant can write to Cadillac Motor 
Car Division i i i Detroit or Ford Motor 
Company in Dearborn. Michigan. 

M A Z D A GLC is n o th in g re v o lu tio n a ry ; just a g re a t little car 
Mazda introduces their new 'Great Little Car’ 

By JIM ABBO TT 
AUTO EDITOR 
Now what do you suppose those letters GLC stand for on Mazda’s latest small car. Not the least bit modest. Mazda will tell you frank­ ly. it is a Great Little Car. 
The GLC is another departure from the rotary engine by Mazda. The parent company, Toyo Kogyo. says they have not lost faith in the rotary and will continue to improve aud advance the engine. 
But in the meantime one must eat, and right now as far as imports are con­ cerned. people are buying nice little packages built around one central design. 
Double box 
The double box on wheels is without doubt the best package anyone has come up with for efficient little cars to carry four people and a few odds and ends from here to there. 
The double box is simple, you build one box for the engine and put it out front, build another for the people, attach lour wheels as close to the corners as possible, and there is the best idea yet. 
Mazda did not choose to use front wheel drive in the CLC. at least not at this time, although there is more than a hint front wheel drive could In* iii the works. 
For one thing when you are Irving to hold down the cost it is less expensive to go with traditional methods instead of spending a lot of money on research and development on a new system. 
If one admits front wheel drive is the

Deluxe version, has a window wiper anti washer. This is a great combination we think should be adopted by all hatch- best way to go for cars of this size, and backs. most experts think that way, then how can the Mazda be a Great Little Car? 
What Mazda has done to make the GLC as good as it is. is to do everything well. 
There is nothing revolutionary, no star­ tling new concepts, no engineering breakthroughs. 
The GLC looks very much like other 
•little cars, good lines, good glass area, convenient hatchback, and surprisingly a better than average front end style. ll is very difficult to design a small car like this and do anything that catches the eye and sets it apart from similar cars. 
Mazda has done very well with the ove-catching front end design. 

All the goodies 
In the driver's position we found most of the goodies w e * have come to expect from the Japanese. The headlights, parking lights, bright and dim switch, front windshield washers and wipers, are all controlled from stalks on tin* steering column. 
The turn signal is there too. 
The instrument panel has a speedo- nieter-odometer combination, tempera­ ture gauge (more on this later) and fuel gauge. Other bits of information are sup-

MAZDA GLC 

Continued From Page i 

 plied by warning-lights. 
The dash also has a coin, or small item tray, on the left side. There is an open package tray in the center of the dash and over on the right a glove box. 

Our car had a push-button AM radio in t ie center of the dash. Remember, tuning 
KS with the knob on the left, volume and off on on the right. 

Seats adjust 

The steering wheel has a nice molded finish, its placement is good. and view of 
• the dash is not obstructed. The seat ad­ justs with plenty of travel, and the back can be inclined to suit your taste. 

The car we drove was equipped with optional five-speed overdrive manual transmission. The shifting pattern is easy to learn, and gear changes can be made with confidence. 

The GLC is equipped with a manual choke. There is a notice on the sunvisor and in the owners manual explaining the shift points for cold engine and warm engine driving. 

There is also a dot on the temperature gauge that indicates when to change from one pattern to the other. 

Follow patterns 

The GLC engine tends to stumble unless the choke is used and the shift patterns are followed. However once proper oper­ ating temperature has been reached the engine performs very well. 

Handling of the GLC does not provide any surprises, steering is rather quick and light, braking is good, cornering about normal, the ride is average for a subcompact. 

One special note: Our test car was equipped with Michelin radial tires, well worth the extra money in our opinion. 
They tend to improve the handling, so the quick steering and good braking we no­ ticed may have been helped by the addi­ tion of the Michelins. 

For the price, the GLC delivers a lot of car for the number of dollars spent, good gasoline mileage, and solid basic design. 
Our thanks to Mike Ross of Tom Benson 
Imports 95oo San Pedro for arranging for our test car.

 pounds, compared with 41 pounds for a comparable steel hood, representing a 43 per cent weight savings.** 
He noted both the inner hood reinforce * nients and the outer hood panels are* 
2o36-T4 heal treated aluminum alloy, while the front latch reinforcement and the two hinge reinforcements on the real are of 5182 alloy. 
^ 
When the metal arrives at Ford s < hi cago Heights plant, it goes through four* different die operations where the inner and outer hoods are formed, drawn, trimmed and ram flanged 
The three latch and hinge reinforcements are then welded to the inner panel 
Through a series of conveyor belts, an adhesive is applied to the outer panel and the inner unit is set in place with clamps holding the two units together until they: are tightly sealed. The final assembly process involves the completed hood be­ ing placed into a 45 die cow l press where a? flange is formed. 
Shireliff indicated this is only the first- of many new aluminum sheet applications* for hang-on automotive parts now in the* planning stage. 
"At this moment. I know of two 1978 car' lines which will be using aluminum sheet' instead of steel. Down the road through* 
198o, more and more automotive divisions will turn to the light weight metal to help* reach their miles-per-gallon goals," be­ sa id.

Green recalls arrest at trial 

AUSTIN 
(A P) 
— Palestine Bist. Atty. 
Billy Ray Green tes­ tified Friday he had been in a peep-show booth only about a min- ute and had just fin­ ished bending over to deposit his quarter when a man in plain clothes burst in with a large flashlight and said, ‘You’re under ar­ rest.’ ” 
Green told the jury in his public lewdness trial he did “ nothing wrong’’ in the booth before the arrest in the early morning hours of 
Jan. 18. 
Prosecutors charge 
Green performed an act of oral sex on a Univer­ sity of Texas graduate student in the curtained booth. 
Green said he had looked in several of the booths during an investigation of what 
Austin law enforcement officers “ regard to be or not to be porno­ graphy.” 
The narrow aisles in the dimly lit area of the peep shows were crowded, and the stereo music played so loudly it nearly gave him a headache. Any conver­ sation had to be shout­ ed, he said, 
He entered booth No. 
18, he said, and noticed another man. “ I said something like, ‘Oh, how is the movie?’ He said, ‘It’s just about over. You’ve missed it.’ 
‘‘I moved back where 
I could see the screen. 
The movie ended short­ ly thereafter. I decided to put another quarter in. I assumed the man who was in there had seen it and would move on. I proceeded to bend over to locate the slot for the quarter. I took considerable care to get my quarter in.” 
He succeeded in depositing the quarter, he said. “ About that time, a man burst into the room and said, 
‘You’re under arrest.’ 
‘‘Ile did not look like any officer I had ever seen in my life.” 
The officers did not behave as if a raid were taking place, he said. 

“ I wasn’t sure what was going to happen to me. It didn’t look like a raid. I saw no un­ iformed officers anywhere. I had not been. frisked. I had not been handcuffed. I had not been informed what 
I was being arrested for. I was beginning to think I was being taken for a ride.” 

COMPILED H O M WIRE SERVICES 

WASHINGTON — President Carter will make a nationally broadcast fireside chat on the dimen­ sions of the country’s energy problems at 7 p.m. 
CST Monday, Press Secretary Jody Powell an­ nounced Friday. 
The announcement said that Carter will outline the serious energy problems facing the nation and the need for a comprehensive energy policy 
At 8 p.m. Wednesday, Carter will make a nationally broadcast appearance before a joint session of Congress to present his proposals for dealing with energy problems and implementing such a policy, Powell said. 

Reward considered 

DETROIT — The killer of seven Michigan youngsters has yet to be caught and Michigan legislators are considering a $i million reward. 
Some other states have had similar long­ standing incentives for the arrest and prosecution of felons. 
Police agencies in Michigan aren’t sure even that much money would pry loose vital informa­ tion on the unsolved kidnap-murders which have terrorized Oakland County north of Detroit. 

Oil supply is low er 

WASHINGTOW — President Carter says that a disturbing new CIA study shows the world has less oil and natural gas than geologists had believed. 
“ Reserve estimates that had been used as a basis for decisions in the past were found to be quite excessive,” he said. “ Reserves are not as great as we thought they were.” 

Judge forbids protest 

NEW YORK — A Queens Supreme Court judge has forbidden a planned demonstration by thou­ sands of cars at Kennedy airport in protest against the supersonic Concorde Jetliner. 
The leader of the scheduled Sunday protest said he would obey Justice Leonard Finz’ temporary injunction, but told newsmen he does not know how his fellow demonstrators will react. 
Finz said he understood that many residents of the airport area were angry about noise and environmental pollution that could be produced by the plane. 
But he said he was afraid such a demonstration could cause an emergency situation — even for planes still in the air near the airport. 
D ock accord nought 

WASHINGTON 
- 
The heads of the longshoremen’s union and a shippers’ organiza­ tion met Friday night with Assistant Labor 
Secretary Frank Burkhardt in an effort to settle a two-day-old dock strike. 
Thomas W. Gleason, president of the 
5o,ooo-member International Longshoremen’s 
Association, and James J. Dickman, president of the Council of New York Shipping Associations, flew in from New York for the meeting. 
At least 34 container ships were caught in the strike at Atlantic and Gulf coast ports. 
The selective strike against seven companies began Thursday after shippers refused a union demand that would have added $2 to current hourly base pay of $8 and would have increased employer contributions to benefit funds. 
Bounty offer shelved 

NEW YORK — A 5,ooo-member gun federation has suspended a $2oo bounty offered to shop­ keepers who kill would-be robbers. 
Efforts to distribute bounties turned down by merchants hit snags when other proposed reci­ pients spurned money from the controversial awards. 
Ohio River aid OKd 

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — President Carter will provide federal aid for the disposal of six tons of toxic chemicals that shut down the sewer system and forced the dumping of IOO million gallons a day of raw sewage into the Ohio River, city officials report. 
The sewage dumping had brought potential health hazards for downstream communities. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reported prepared to spend up to $3 million for removing the chemicals, although the cost is expected to be much lower than that. 
U.S. Mauls trawler 

BOSTON — The Justice Department charged the captain of a seized Russian fishing trawler with violating the New new U.S. 2oo-mile limit and sought the forfeiture of his vessel. 
Capt. Aleksandr Gupalov was arraigned in U.S. 
District Court on criminal charges, while civil charges were filed against his 275-foot ship, the 
Taras Shevchenko. The 41-year-old skipper did not enter a plea, but his lawyer said he will fight the charges. 
Plea withdrawal sought 

SAN FRANCISCO — A lawyer for Sara Jane 
Moore says her client did not understand the nature of the charge when she pleaded guilty of trying to assassinate then-president Gerald R. 
Ford in 1975. 
Attorney Peggy Garrity Edwards filed a motion with U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti to vacate Mrs. Moore’s life sentence and allow her to withdraw her guilty plea. 

Arms control eyed 

WASHINGTON — President Carter says the 
Soviet Union still may have enough flexibility to reach an agreement with the United States despite rejecting two U.S. arms control propo­ sals. 
Carter told newsmen that Moscow prefers to negotiate a limited restriction of nuclear weapons while “ we prefer immediate and drastic reduc­ tions.” 
Actually, he said, “ I ’m not sure they’ve drawn too sharp a distinction, and there is still enough flexibility, I believe, to have hopes we can reach an agreement.” 
New m ovem ent neen 
SAN FRANCISCO — Handicapped demonstra­ tors who have occupied a federal building for 11 days testified from wheelchairs that they are in the vanguard of a new civil rights movement. 
“ It is difficult to argue that the rights of disabled citizens should be any less protected than the rights of minority groups or women.” demonstrator Judy Heumann told an ad hoc congressional committee chaired by two Califor­ nia Democrats, George Miller and Phillip Bur­ ton. 
Lining the hallway outside the crowded hearing room were the sleeping bags and air mattresses used by about 125 crippled, blind or deaf demon­ strators who have occupied the fourth floor of the regional offices of HUD since April 4. 
Uela fooled 'em 
DALLAS — Mrs. Uela Beilharz was approached by two female swindlers who produced an enve­ lope containing $1,ooo and a note that said: ‘ “ I ’ve won $28,ooo on horses and I want you to take care of it so I don’t have to pay taxes on it.” 
Mrs. Beihlarz said she immediately recognized she was being conned into the old “ pigeon drop” in which the victim is supposed to put up some good faith money. 
The swindlers never got a chance to explain the scheme, since Mrs. Beihlarz suggested they go to the police station instead of her bank. 
She is the mother of the police sergeant in charge of the bunco squad where such schemes are investigated.

By DAVID HENDRICKS 
The cost of relying on im ­ ported oil is between $16o and 
$18o to each American every year, a University of Texas at 
San Antonio professor said 
Friday. 
Dr. Scott Jones, who alis a con­ s u lta n t w ith the S ou thw est R e ­ search Institute, said the natural gas sho rtage last w inter was the result of a bad federal energy po­ licy, p rim a rily the regulation of prices. 
Dr. Jones was the last speaker in a series of energy talks. The series was the 17th annual en gin eering sem in ar conducted by the en g in ­ eering division of St. M ary’s Uni­ versity. 
1954 

“ America has been heading for trouble since 1954.” Dr. Jones said. 
“ That was the y ear the U.S. Su­ prem e Court allowed regulation of natural gas prices at the wellhead.” 
Supply s h o r ta g e s , like la st winter, would be less likely if gas price dereg u latio n is allowed to close the gap between supply and demand, Dr. Jones explained. 
He said the economic impact of last w in te r ’s g a s s h o rta g e was between $2 billion and $3 billion. 
The nation also is in a bind over foreign imports of crude oil. Before the 1973 e m b a rg o by the M iddle 
East oil cartel. Americans paid only 

 about $15 per person per year as a result of foreign oil. 
That figure is now between SI fin and $18o, D r. Jo n e s said. If oil prices w ere deregulated also, oil p ro du cers could increase supply with m o re e x p en siv e reco v ery methods, thus stablizing prices. 
Blackout 
U nder c u rre n t policies and in­ creasin g ra te s of electricity con­ sumption. Dr. Jones said estimates predicted a 5o-5o chance for nation­ wide blackout by 1985, resulting in a 
$23 billion loss to the gross national product, the worst setback since the depression in the 193os. 4 
Dr. 
J o n e s called 
P re s id e n t 
C arter’s coming energy proposals. as p relim in arily reported, inept, partially because the proposals do not include decontrol of prices. 
The proposed taxes on gasoline and crude oil will only increase the governm ent’s tax income, which is used to run regulatory agencies. 
The money should instead go into exploration, Dr. Jones said. 
Reactor 
C a r te r ’s pro po sal to stop c o n ­ struction of fast-breeder re a c to r nuclear plants will cost each family 
$25o a year in energy costs, he pre­ dicted. because uranium for other nuclear plants will be more expen­ sive. 
Dr. Jones also predicted C arter's proposals will be heavily revised by 
Congress.

HOUSTON — A 12th juror still is needed in the capital m urder trial of former San Antonio MacArthur

Masseuses seek to KO ordinance 

Three San Antonio women went into 57th 
District Court Friday to attempt to block the education requirem ent in the city's m assage parlor regulatory ordinance. 
That city order dem ands completion of three sem ester hours in anatomy and physiology from some acceptable college or university for any masseuses seeking a city license. 
Without that training qualification, the appli­ cant will be denied a license by the police chief. 
Two of the women, Michiko F. Clark and 
Barbara A. Miller, are currently employed as masseuses here. 
The third, Cindy Lee A nderson, has been denied licensing by Vice Cupt. Jam es A. Despres on behalf of Chief Emil E. Peters, according to the suit. 
None of the women have taken the required training courses spelled out in the ordinance. And no such course is now available, the petition states. 
The only time the course was available — 
August through December 1976 at St. Phillip’s 
College — the ordinance had been enjoined in an earlier court test, the petition states.
