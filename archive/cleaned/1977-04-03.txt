Monfrey: I still will win 

By KEMPER DIEHL 
John Monfrey stepped to a microphone late Saturday and told cheering supporters: 
“ I need your enthusiastic support for two weeks longer and I assure you I will be your next mayor.” 
The scen e w as possibly the m ost elegant election night party of recent years. 
Supporters of the m illionaire beer distributor virtually filled the expan­ sive terrace around the second floor swim m ing pool of El Tropieano Motor 
Hotel. 
Around the edges of the big crowd, flum ing torches threw highlights on the still, blue waters of the pool. 
A ccom p anied by his w ife and cam p aign a id es. M onfrey arrived shortly after the final vote count was announced. 
He wasted no time pounding home an upbeat m essage for supporters who had spent a long day at the polls. 
“You’ve done an outstanding job.” he asserted. “ We gained 14.o1)1) votes 

 this tim e over what we had at this point two years ago.” 
A big green chalk board carried a final total w hich sh ow ed M onfrey trailing Mayor Lila Cockrell by about 
9.ooo \otes. 
The challenger told his workers: 
“ Remember, last time we picked up 
19.ooo votes in the runoff. 
M onfrey saw good tidings for his runoff battle in results from the North 
Side. 
Referring to the victories of Coun­ cilmen Phil Pyndus. Glen Hartman and and John Steen in old strongholds of the Good Governm ent League, Mon­ frey asserted: 
“ Most of the races on the North Side are over. That is a definite advantage on our behalf. It m eans less that we have to make up.” 
Monfrey was asked if he could ac­ count for a .total voter turnout which fell below expectations. 
“ Maybe the day was too pretty,” he replied jovially.

Lila predicts hard-won victory 

By RON WHITE 

Mayor Lila Cockrell, ailing with a sore throat and afflicted with a near-em p ty cam p aig n chest, was all smiles Saturday night as she greeted supporters at her G u n te r Hotel election headquarters. 
The mayor, who faced a heavily-fin­ anced campaign by local businessman 
John Monfrey, garnered nearly 4o per cent of the at-large vote in Saturday’s election. 
Monfrey gained a runoff spot on the 
April 16 ballot taking 31.2 per cent of the vote. 
Dr. Jose San Martin finished with 
26.5 per cent of the vote for third place among the nine candidates entered. 
Although the mayor had been in bed most of the day taking penicillin, she pledged an aggressive cam paign for the city’s top post. 
“Tomorrow we go to work.” she told the more than IOO supporters gathered. 
“ I know we’re going to win two weeks from tonight.” 
Before voting results began coming in. the m ayor’s cam paign m anager, 
Lewis Ground, said he would be happy with a 3 to 5 per cent lead going into the runoff. 
The mayor’s 39.1 per cent total had her supporters predicting a victory. 
But workers agreed that the pending race would not be easy. 
Ground, who estim ated the Cockrell coffers at near zero, said the mayor had spent $6o,ooo on her re-election bid. 
He also estim ated Monfrey’s expen­ ditures thus far at $25o,ooo with an­ other $2oo,9oo designated for a runoff campaign.

They found it level and square — about 3o feet by 3o feet. 
Napoleon had the top blasted off 15o years ago to show the conquered

FATHER HENRY BRENNAN 
Stockbroker retires to priesthood 

The Rev. Henry Brennan guarantees a short sermon during his first mass 
Sunday. 
The 65-year-old former stockbroker, ordained Saturday as a Roman 
Catholic priest, doesn’t want the mass to get too long for the 22 grandchildren who will be attending. 
“ IT I make it a very short homily,” said Brennan, who noted that the Palm 
Sunday gospel reading is much longer than usual anyway. 
“ We’re going to have all those kids in the front pews.” 
Father Brennan’s three daughters, four sons and 22 of his 23 grandchil­ dren flew to Milwaukee from New 
.Jersey on Friday for the ordination and first mass. 
Two of the youngsters will receive first communion from their grand­ father Sunday. 
Father Brennan, who is from Man­ asquan, N J., had been a successful stockbroker with a six-figure annual income in the early 197os when he be­ gan to think about a new start in life.

PAUL 
THOMPSON 

If the guy who liquidated 
Joyce Packey Stein in her ele­ gant Terrell Hills home just keeps his trap shut, it’s unlikely the authorities will ever put to­ gether more than a circumstan­ tial case against him. 

The sexy divorcee, who had two known boyfriends and un ex-husband in her lift* at the time of death last April ll, was shot down with a .38 caliber revolver that investi­ gators believe was her own. 

• 
But they have never come up with this weapon, or any other gun that can be tied to the bizarre murder. 

The killer must be laughing at this 

Furthermore, they have no eyeball witness to the shooting. 

They haven’t even found a person or per­ sons in that tree-filled suburban neighbor­ hood who can identify a suspicious looking 
“ intruder” entering or leaving the SI 1o.ooo 
Eventide dwelling at the officially set time of death—12:3o a.m. April ll. 

Stanley Stein, the late Joyce's husband, told this column Saturday: 
"Eight months ago, at my own expense, I hired two Dallas private detectives who have worked on the murder case day and night since. They have made new findings, all turned over to Terrell Hills Police Chief W. C. 
(Bill) Madison.” 
Stein said the findings were along the lines of "cracks in the alibi of one of the murder suspects.” 
Asked if he would care to identify the suspect, Stein said. “ Not right now, but it 

 sure as heck wasn’t me.” 

Ifs known that Stein and one of 39-year-old 
Joyce’s boyfriends went to Austin a few days after her death, took a DPS lie detector test—and passed. 

“ Up to then.” says Stein, a local business­ man, " I kind of headed the list of suspects as ex-husband of the victim.” 
Still a third man also appeared in Austin for a polygraph test that same week but was rejected by DPS operatives as “ too full of medication,” and never did go back for a second try. 
After that, though Terrell Hills police and 
Sheriff’s Investigator Bill White spent untold hours hunting down clues, the investigation hit a blank wall. 
Then last Friday, Terrell Hills Police Chief 
Madison was seduced by a representative of the local Hearst Press into saying there was a big new “ break” in the murder case. 

Madison, who took over as chief early this vear, got on TV that night and R E P E A T E D 
IT. 

What was the “ new break?” Chief Madison would not say. He'wouldn't even hint. Ile named no names. He just sat there and talked in circles. 

The effect of Madison’s grandstanding was to hack off his predecessor Harold Bother, who’s going down to the Terrell Hills City 
Hall Monday "to find out why Chief Madison implied negligence on my part and that of 
Patrolman Mich Hose, not to mention Sher­ iff's Investigator White.” 
Bother insists he and the others "broke our bozzongas” on the Stein case. 

Representatives of the Bexar Count* district attorney's office were equally miffed at t hief Madison. 

“ If there’s any kind of new lead warranting 

 all this to-do in the media,” said one of them, 
“ the proper procedure would be to give it to us and G E T T H IS C A SE B E F O R E T H E 
GRAND JU B Y .” 
Says widower Stanley Stein: 
"That’s the thing I’m interested in — lay­ ing the whole matter on the grand jury right away. Even if they count me as a suspect. 
Maybe there’s enough to bring a murder in­ dictment. maybe not. No one will know until it's all aired out.” 

But even he admitted the total body of evi­ dence remains entirely in the realm of the circumstantial. 
In brief, there’s still no death weapon, no eyeball witness and no ED. on an “ intruder" the night of the shooting of .Joyce Packey 
Stein. 
And right now the only hope of getting a 
Murder I conviction in this weird case lies in needling the key suspect, as in those Columbo 
TV shows, into opening his mouth and doing some wildly foolish blabbing. 
Elderly woman loses $11,ooo 

By MARK VILLANUEVA 

A 72-year-old self-employed 
North Side woman had accumu­ lated two modest savings ac­ counts over several years, but in less than an hour she lost it all. 
Mrs. Myrtle Nussbaum of HJJ Hol­ lywood Ave. reported to police she lost about $11.o(1(1 after she met two women 
Friday and decided to divide some 
“ lost” money. . . 
She also lost her monthly Social Se­ curity check in the deal. 
The elderly woman, who sells cos­ metics to support herself, met a wo­ man in her late 3os on the parking lot of a store in the 71oo block of San Pedro 
Avenue, police said. 

Tlit” woman was hilkeil tail o f her life savings a fter lint women wanted her to fail an m oney so they could d i­ vide a l a r g e sum t h e y fo u n d * 

Officers reported the woman seemed interested in buying cosmetic products from Mrs. Nussbaum when the pair was confronted by another woman. 
The woman told them she had an envelope with a large amount of cash and a bank deposit slip, police said. 
The envelope allegedly was addressed to someone in Cuba.

Kite Fair breezes through at last 

The annual Kite Fair finally got off the ground Saturday at 
Brackenridge Park, after a one-year delay because of rain. 

The fair, sponsored by the City 
Recreation Departm ent and 
KITE Radio, was last rained out 
March 26. Area kite flyers had 

 been rained out three times last year. 
But the skies cleared Saturday and a breeze strong enough to lift a kite or two blew. 
Kite flyers, age 6 to 96, com­ peted in four categories: pret­ tiest, largest, highest flown and most unique kite. 

The w oman asked them* if I ho cash., belonged to them, police said. 
The elderly woman told the two wo­ men the money did not belong to her. according to reports. 
The woman with the money told the victim she would go to the store and ask her “ head lady” for advice on what to do with the money, officers report­ ed. 

Police said she came back out and it was agreed the women would have to put up some money to obtain their share of the "lost money.” 
One of the women drove the elderly woman to a nearby branch and a downtown branch of a savings asso­ ciation where Mrs. Nussbaum with­ drew money from her savings accounts. 

Cashed checks 
The women drove to another bank where Mrs. Nussbaum cashed several checks, including her Social Security check, police reported. 
The women then returned to the store's parking lot and again met the second woman. 
Police said the woman with the en­ velope of money went inside the store to check the bills’ serial numbers with her “ head lady.” 
The woman returned and told Mrs. 
Nussbaum she could collect lier share from a woman inside in the store. 
When Mrs. Nussbaum returned to the parking lot — with no money — the women had already left, police said. 
Robbery detectives were continuing the investigation Saturday.

ROSE LAGE goes to fly her frog-an d-flow er decorated kite in the Senior Citizen Division at the Kite Fair 

The Tenerife crash survivor who developed an infection be­ cause of severe burns has stabi­ lized, Army burn specialists at 
Brooke Army Medical Center said Saturday. 

The burn patient, one of 14 survivors hospitalized at Brooke since Wednes­ day, is still on the critical list, how­ ever, according to Maj. Richard Treat, a physician with Brooke’s Institute for 
Surgical Research burn center. 

No signs 

“ The patient with the infection has stabilized and shows no sign of further deterioration,” Maj. Treat said. 
A mild improvement was noticed iii the ll other burn patients being treat­ ed at the burn center, he said. 

Two non-burn patients, also survi­ vors of the world's worst aviation dis­ aster, are being treated at Brooke for other injuries. 

“ The patients are stable and all had a restful night Frid ay.” Maj. Treat said. "A ll are conscious and coherent and recieve family visits twice a day.” 
Three burn patients remain on the critical list, he said, while the other nine are active and move about. 

Airlift 

The 14 survivors were hospitalized at 
Brooke following their airlift to Kelly 
A FB Wednesday from McGuire AFB, 
•NJ. 

They are among bl) survivors of the fiery crash between two 747 airliners at 
Tenerife, Canary Islands, last Sunday 
The crash killed 578 other people. 

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S — Sunday April 3 1977 
Energy agency hits snag 

WASHINGTON (A P ) - President 
C arter's proposal for a new D epart­ ment of Energy, the centerpiece of his energy program , is running into major problems in Congress. 
Looming as the biggest obstacle to the reorganization is deciding what to' do about the Federal Power Commis­ sion, the independent agency that re­ gulates interstate natural g as prices and pipelines and some forms of elec­ tric power. 
Some congressional sources suggest that C arter's proposal to abolish the 
FTC is so controversial it may have to be scrapped, deferred or substantially modified if the legislation is to pass this year. 
Congressional leaders w ho once pre­ dicted quick action on the proposal are now acknow ledging there will be a long, knock-down, drag-out fight on many of the bill’s provisions. 
Late summer 
Som e Capitol Hill staffers say they doubt action can com e before late sum m er. And clearly the bill isn t go- ing anywhere before Carter's April 2o announcement of the policy part of his energy package. 
The a d m in istra tio n had in itially hoped Congress could approve the new 

Proposed reorganization would abolish the Federal Power Commissibn that re­ gulates interstate natural aas prices 
( ? 
“ 
I and pipelines 

 department quickly, so it would be in place to handle the new policy. 
The proposed reorganization would abolish the FPC , the Energy Research and Development Administration and the F ed eral Energy Adm inistration and consolidate their functions with those of energy p ro gram s now sc a t­ tered am o n g nine other fe d e ral agencies. 
ERDA and many of the other pro­ gram s have as their m ajor purpose the promotion of energy development. 
Crippling 

White House energy assistant Ja m e s 
R Schlesinger, whom Carter has de­ signated to head the new department as the first secretary of energy, claim s leaving the FPC out of the reorganiza­ tion would cripple the President's en­ ergy program. 

The FP C regulates g a s prices and the F E A regulates oil prices. Those regulatory duties must be combined and a “ firm line of com mand” estab­ lished to deal with now-fragmented energy policy issues, Schlesinger said. 
In four weeks of hearings before the 
Senate G overnm ental A ffa irs Com ­ mittee and two days of hearings before a counterpart House panel, the FPC issue has emerged as the most contro­ versial element of the President's pro­ posal. 
Many congressm en are hesitant to combine regulation of energy in the sam e departm ent that prom otes its development. 
The a d m in istra tio n bill would create a new economic regulation ad­ m inistration within the new d epart­ ment in an effort to isolate regulation from other fu n ction s, with a new 

 hearings and ap p eals board to take over some of the cases now heard by the FPC. 
Blit critics claim the bill still gives too much power to the energy secre­ tary to decide procedures under which energy rates and allocation are deter­ mined. 
One Senate aide suggested that if the 
FPC is abolished as Carter wants! then 
Congress will likely modify the propo­ sal to make sure the energy secretary has as little say as possible over regu­ lation. 
Rep. John Dinged, D-Mich., has put 
House leaders on notice that he may insist the bill be re-referred to the 
House Com merce Committee, where he ch airs an influential energy and power subcom m ittee, if the Govern­ m ent O p e ra tio n s C o m m ittee g o e s along with C arte r’s proposal to d is­ m antle the FTC. 
Dinged said the F P C 's regulation of pipeline routes and of electric utilities that engage in interstate com m erce should not be shoved into the new de­ partment. 
Some m em bers of Congress argue that regulatory agencies are delibera­ tely isolated from the executive branch and, in some aspects, are extensions of 
Congress.

Bank didn’t laugh at this 

CHICAGO (AP) - Lin­ as Gylys was pretty sure he only had 67 cents in his checking account, but his bank seemed to think he had $4.5 million. 
When he receiv ed a statement from the bank on his newly found wealth, he showed it to his friends. “ Everyone I showed it to said the same thing — ‘You’ve got to find out how to get the money out.’” said Gylys, who had his own ideas. 
On April Fool’s Day, he walked into the Contin­ ental Bank and, tongue in cheek, asked for a $4.5 million certified check m ade out to J.H . P e r ­ kins, the president of the bank. 
April Fool’ 

“ I wanted to give the check to him and say, 
‘April Fool,’” said Gylys, 
31. 
But bank o ffic ia ls didn’t laugh. When Gylys attempted to certify his personal check, he was greeted by a curious look from the teller, then more curious looks from bank employes who fran­ tically sta rte d d ia lin g telephones. 
Two employes then in­ vited Gylys and a friend who had gone to the bank with him into an office where they questioned him for an hour. The two didn't seem to think it was very funny. 
Keypunch 

The error was traced to a keypunch error. Gylys w as given a c e rtified check for 67 cents. And the bank closed his a c ­ count “ due to the manner in which custom er has transacted business.” 
But the bank officials began to sm ile when 
Gylys’ companion iden­ tified himself as a new­ spaper reporter. 

“ They suddenly were more friendly” said Gy­ lys. “ They even reopened the account and patted me on the back. One guy seemed to be glued with a smile.” 

Gylys was allowed to keep the bank statements as mementos of his brief fling as a millionaire.

STORE-OWNER

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

SAN FRANCISCO—Tensions that began when a Nazi book­ store opened in a building owned by a Jew who survived 
Auschwitz continued Saturday with an Anti-Semitic recorded telephone message. 
A recording heard when calling the 
Rudolph Mess Bookstore blamed vandalism at the store on “ Jewish thugs” and “ insane gangsters.” The message ended with a call for “ white victory” and a $2 donation. 
The store, which opened last week to the sound of martial music and the sight of men in storm trooper uni­ forms. sold racist literature such as 
“ Our Nordic Race.” 
After Friday night's disturbance at the bookstore, which included lot) anti-Nazis attempting to keep fire­ men from putting out flames in the store, five large stained glass win­ dows at the Temple B'nai Lemunuh were riddled with rock holes. 
The evening of violence began about dusk when 5H adults, carrying hatchets and crowbars, smashed into 

 the store. 
While IOO onlookers cheered, the mob tore apart bookshelves and ripped up tye literature. 
Two men were arrested for ques­ tioning about the attack on the store. 
They were Allan Weiss, 24. and his father. Morris Weiss, 53. Both men were released on bail. 
Shortly after midnight Saturday, neighborhood residents reported that the synagogue, across the street from the bookstore had been vandalized. 
A few minutes later, a group of teenagers were back into the store and burned some of the books. 
The flames were confined to the store area and did not spread up­ stairs to the home of the building's owner. Nathan Green. 
Green, a survivor of Auschwitz who lost a father, two brothers and two sisters in German concentration camps, said he didn’t know of the 
Nazi nature of the business when lie leased the store to Allen Vincent, head of the National Socialist White 
Workers Party. 
The bookstore was named after the imprisoned former Nazi leader. 
Green has given Vincent an evic­ tion notice, effective April 5.

Pyndus winner without runoff 

By VICKIE DAVIDSON 
When I). Ford Nielsen con­ ceded the District 8 City Council race to Phil Pyndus by phone at 
8:3o p.m. Saturday, they both agreed P yn d u s’ outright win was a surprise. 
“ I n e v e r e x p e c t e d a n y th in g lik e t h i s , ” sa id in c u m b e n t C o u n cilm a n 
N ielsen, who lost by a 2 to I margin to fellow-incumbent Pyndus. 
“ I thought it would be a runoff." a sm ilin g Pyndus said at his cam paign 

 h eadquarters w hen the resu lts w ere becoming obvious. 
Of the s'ix candidates in the District 8 race, Pyndus and Nielsen drew m ost of the voters. The darkhorse candidates were Fred Barricklow, David Brown 
Jr., Winifred Vetter and Steven Wolf- son. 

District 8 — located in far Northwest 
San Antonio — was the only race w here two in cu m b en ts w ere pitted again st each other as a result of the districting plan a p p r o v e d e a r ly th is y e a r by voters.

Councilman 
Nielsen, 
44. 
Nielsen w as the second councilman to bit the dust Saturday. 
T he runoff for m ayor w ill occupy center stage in the runoff, as it has all along during the cam paign, as befits the only citywide race. 
Monfrey had the money, outspending 
Mrs. Cockrell 5-to-l through March 23. 
His expenditures up to that point, cam e to $15o,ooo, half of the $3oo,ooo he spent in losing to Mrs. Cockrell iii a runoff two years ago. 
But Monfrey can be encouraged by the fact he trailed Mrs. Cockrell by 
21,ooo v otes in the first election two years ago, and narrowed it in losing to 
7,2oo votes. 
The key to the runoff could lay with 
San M artin , w ho serv ed w ith M rs. 
Cockrell on the council under the au­ spices of the defunct Good Government 
L e a g u e , and h is s u p p o r t e r s . B oth runoff candidates will lie saying very nice things about San Martin between now and April lti. 
For San Martin, his third-place fin­ ish must com e as a bitter disappoint­ ment. It seem s the doctor is destined always to be best man and never the groom in his hopes to becom e the first 
M exican-Am erican m ayor of Sun An­ tonio. 
Two years ago he lost out to Mrs. 
Cockrell when the Good Governm ent 
League selected her over San Martin by one vote to carry its banner into the mayoral war. Except for that one vote. 
San Martin m ight be mayor today. 
Cisneros. 29. positioning him self for a race for m ay or in 1979, polled lti tim es more votes than the total votes pulled down by his two opponents. 
In District 9. voters evidently decid­ ed they prefer a weatherman to a bu­ sin essm a n . Hartm an, 47, beat busin­ essm an J im Dement, 5o, by better than 
3-to-l, and the runner-up in that race. 
Republican State Com m itteem an Van 
H enry A rch er . 3ti. beat D em en t by more than 2-to-l. 
P e r c e n t a g e w is e . C isn e r o s p u lled down an am azing 92.ti per cent of the vote in his three-man race, Steen cam e in with 73.7 per cent. Pyndus logged ti2.6 per cent, and Hartman registered 
56.4 per cent. 
S teen had to y ed w ith the id ea of running for m ayor this year, but shied away after learning Monfrey intended mounting a top-flight, expensive ca m ­ paign once again. 

Formal endorsem ents by special in­ terest grou p s apparently m ade little difference in the outcom e of the e lec­ tion, at least in the first go. 
T he A llia n c e for a B etter City — which rose from the ashes of the Old 
CGL, bloomed awhile and then faded 

— won one outright, lost three and has four runoffs. 
A labor consortium of three public e m p lo y e s ’ unions won one outright, lost three, and has three runoffs. 
T h e San A nton io P o lic e O ffic e r s 
Assn. won two outright, lost two and has seven in runoffs. The San Antonio 
Firefighters Assn. won two, lost two and has five in the finale. 
The San Antonio Building and Con­ stru ctio n T r a d e s C ouncil won with 
Cisneros, lost with San Martin, and is backing runoff can d id ates Billa and 
Teniente. 
Mrs. Cockrell’s lead cam e from the 
North Side. San Martin had a slight lead in a re p r e se n ta tiv e n u m b er of 
South Side boxes, but all three major candidates shared that vote. It was San 
Martin going away on the West Side, and Monfrey had a comfortable lead on the East Side. 
N orth San A ntonio, a s it did two years ago, gave Mrs. Cockrell a strong m a r g in . F o u r te e n k ey N orth S ide boxes c a m e in with a total of ti.3o7 votes for the mayor. 3,542 for Monfrey, and 1.58o votes for San Martin. 
Fifteen key South Side boxes gave 
San Martin 3,115 votes, Mrs. Cockrell 
2.8o2, and Monfrey 2,6o5. 
COPS 
C om m unities Organized for Public 
Service — a som etim es hot issue in the council races — was not officially in­ volved in the city election. 
Iii D istrict 9. w h ere D em en t c a m ­ p aigned h e a v ily a g a in s t COPS and 
Hartman’s support of COPS’ positions on som e issu es, the hoped-for North 
Side backlash against the City Council lobbying by COPS did not materialize. 
In Districts where COPS had organ­ ization al s tr e n g th . “ C a n d id a te A c­ countability N ights’’ w ere held, but no endorsem ents w ere m ade. Those d is­ tricts are chiefly on the city ’s West and 
South sides. 
COPS had launched a voter r e g is­ tration drive and spent several days prior to the election calling voters and going door-to-door to encourage a large voter turnout. 
A battle in District 5 lined up anti- 
COP5 forces behind Dario Chapa, but 
Eureste unofficially carried the COPS banner and wound up leading Chapa into the runoff. 
As expected. San Martin fared well on th e W e st S id e in th e M e x ic a n - 
American voting precincts, but not as well as he needed to do to make the runoff. 
S even W e st S id e b o x e s r e co rd ed 
2.753 votes for San N artin , 1,1(18 for 
Monfrey. and 736 for Mrs. Cockrell. 
M onfrey em erged as the big vote- getter on the East Side. F ive East Side precincts with the largest percentage of blacks in the city cam e in for Mon­ frey with 1,354 votes. M rs. Cockrell received 7o8 votes in the five precincts, and San Martin trailed with 188. 
Mrs. Cockrell did well with the city’s senior citizens. In the six voting pre­ cincts with the largest number of peo­ ple 65 or over. Mrs. Cockrell’s vote was 
1.373, M o n fr e y ’s w a s 952. and San 
Martin drew down 594. _ 
Will the runoff candidates take a few days off to get over the rigors of the initial campaign? 
Not on anybody's life. Most of the candidates will hit the cam paign trail running Sunday, appearing before the 
West Side Coalition’s Candidate Selec­ tion Com m ittee at 2 p. rn. at the Casa 
Blanca Party House, Poplar and 'trin­ ity Streets. 
That appearance is particularly im ­ portant to Mrs. Cockrell and Monfrey, both of whom will be seeking the vote of San Martin and his supporters. 
The W est Side C oalition endorsed 
San Martin in Saturday’s election. 

Nielsen said he w as a casualty of that districting plan — which he had sup­ ported — when he gath ered 4o su p ­ porters around him to concede defeat. 
B e s i d e s th e d is t r ic t in g , the 
44-year-old dentist said he didn't know- all the reasons for his loss. He said one of them, however, was the media sup­ port Pyndus had gotten. 
Pyndus said, “ I’m overw helmed and gratified. I voted in the interest of Hie people on that council and it looks like they returned that confidence in me. 
“ The issu es w ere distorted in the campaign and I'm grateful the voters saw through that.” said Pyndus. who is founder and p resid en t of P yn d u s 
Steel Co. 
‘Smeared’ 

“ It w a s one of the m o st sm ea re d cam paigns I’ve ever been in." 
The 55-year-old councilman said his character had been attacked on several counts — including absenteeism from council m eetin gs, being antibusiness and anticonservative. 
Pyndus, known as the conservative voice on the old co u n cil, countered such attacks by showing he was absent less than Nielsen. 
“ The real good feelin g is, I don't have a paid person working for me. . . 
N ielsen had P itlu k A d vertisin g and paid em ployes." said Pyndus. 
P yndus also said fire fighters and p o lic e o ff ic e r s w e r e c a m p a i g n in g against him — because he had opposed 
State Sen. Frank L om bardino’s sick pay plan for fire and police em ployes. 
“ B ’s kind of discouraging to see city em ployes campaign against you.” 
Nielsen said Saturday he didn't think the campaign was dirty. "It got a little distorted. I don't think I was slinging mud. I don’t think Phil w a s.” 
Undecided 

N ielsen, who had served three years on City Council, said he didn’t know if h e’d seek political office again. He said he would keep working for econom ic development and the people. 
Nielsen had been accused of chang­ ing his political philosophies. 
“ I’m still Ford N ielsen ," he said. 
“ I ve ch an g ed so m e. T he town has changed a great deal." 
C an d id ate W olfson sa id S atu rd ay 
Pyndus was a very fine man. “ He ran a clean cam paign.”

San Martin may withhold his support 

By ALAN BAILEY 
Dr. J o se San M artin, su rp risin g p o litica l o b se r v e r s by fin is h in g a strong third, indicated Saturday night he m ay sit out the m ayoral runoff election 
“ I m ay stay com pletely out of it," said San Martin co m m en tin g on a possible endorsem ent of Mayor Lila 
Cockrell or businessm an John Mon­ frey. 
San Martin was visably disappointed

 a political asset for Mrs. Cockrell. 
' ‘After spending that m uch m oney and not d o in g any b e tt e r th an he 
(M on frey) did, h is su p p o r ters m ay think twice about throwing good m on­ ey after bad,” said George Shipley, a pollster for the Cockrell cam paign. 
Shipley also said his polls show that the San Martin vote will be split in the runoff, with the majority going to Mrs. 
Cockrell. 
The mayor said San Martin would be approached for his support, but she added: 
“ We don’t want to put any pressure on him. Dr. San Martin is an honorable m an." 
Steve Hester, the m ayor’s campaign coordinator, said the first effort to be 
E-N poll compared to results 

The E xpress-N ew s Electronic Poll published Friday w as correct in show­ ing that Mayor Lila Cockrell would face challenger John Monfrey in a runoff, but failed by som e nine per­ centage points to show the full support for former City Councilman Dr. Jose 
San Martin. 
The poll showed San Martin with only 17.4 per cent of the vote while unofficial returns Saturday night cre­ dited him with 26.5 per cent. 
The poll was about five percentage points off for both Monfrey and Mrs. 
Cockrell. M onfrey received 31.2 per cent while the poll showed him receiv­ ing 35.2 per cent. Mrs. Cockrell led the race with 39.1 per cent instead of the 
34.1 per cent credited in the poll. 
The poll showed that 1o.5 per cent of those surveyed were undecided when the poll was taken on Thursday. 
Public opinion polls of this type are co n sid ered s ta tis tic a lly sig n ifica n t within a three per cent margin. 

 m ade now is to raise m oney for the runoff. Hester said the m ayor’s lead — larger than polls had predicted — may influence persons who have withheld financial support from any of the can­ didates to support Mayor Cockrell now. 
But all of the m ayor’s workers e m ­ phasized they do not hope to be able to match Monfrey dollar for dollar iii the runoff. M ayor C ockrell w ill depend largely on volunteer efforts, they said. 
Margaret Jones, volunteer coordina­ tor for the mayor, predicted volunteer help would increase now that m any of the council races are through. 
“ W e e x p e c t th a t a lot of (G le n ) 
Hartman’s people will start working in our cam paign now that he’s won his election," she said. 
And in fact, one of H artm an’s c a m ­ paign staff was at the m ayor’s gather­ ing Saturday night and said she would b eg in w o r k in g for M ayor C ock rell 
Sunday. 
Campaign w orkers said they would begin planning their runoff strategy im m ediately, but they said the runoff basically will be a continuation of the tactics used initial cam paign. 
Asked what her strongest point will be in the runoff, the m ayor said, "If w e’ve got one, it’s one of our secrets.” 
M ay or C o c k r e ll a r r iv e d at th e 
Gunter about 8 p.m . Saturday. She had toured som e of the polls earlier in the day before going to bcd until tim e to attend the cam paign party. She said she had Inst her voice F riday w hile campaigning. 
But she w as sm iling and lively as she told supporters. “ W e've got a strong lead . . . and a winning spirit." 
Two re-elected in S.A. Ranch 

Two incumbent directors of the San 
Antonio Ranch Municipal Utility D is­ trict were re-elected Saturday. 
Herb P arks and Glenn Reed ran unopposed for the offices. 
They have served on the board since its creation in 1974. 
The utility district serves San An­ tonio Ranch, a subdivision located in 
Northwest Bexar County. 

 in not m aking the runoff. The former councilman and his supporters at El 
Mercado were jubilant until the final results cam e in. 
"I knew the polls were wrong be­ cause it didn’t reflect m y strong or­ ganization,” said San Martin. 
No regrets 
The defeated candidate said he had no regrets about the cam paign. “ I ran a good race, a clean cam paign utilizing hundreds and hundreds of volunteers. 
“ But I had lim ite d fin a n c ia l r e ­ sources. It w as unfortunate. 
“ M uch to th e d i s s e r v i c e of th e voters, Monfrey and Cockrell avoid the issu es of leadership, econom ic d ev e­ lopment, surface w ater and sew er sy s­ tem . T hey w ere never d isc u sse d by either candidate.’ 
But on the p o ssib le en d o r sem en t. vSan Martin did say. “ I will discuss this problem with m y cam paign advisors. 
These people have done a trem endous job and I could not m ake a unilateral d ecisio n w ithout d is c u s s in g it w ith them." 
San Martin said he was inclined to stay out of the runoff and withhold the endorsement. 
San Martin w as asked if this race would be his last for city office. 
The 6o-year-old San Martin replied, 
"I have never given that serious con­ sideration. I take it one thing at a time. 
So I m ight c o n sid e r s e e k in g o ffic e again in the future." 
MAYOR 

 might make in his runoff cam paign, he said: 
“ I’m going to do the sam e construc­ tive cam paigning and advertising.” 
Monfrey, who outspell his rivals by a lopsided m argin in the c a m p a ig n leading to Saturday’s vote, said he did not expect to spend a high rate in the runoff. 
“ B ’s obvious the business com m u n­ ity did not finance Lila in the way she wanted," he observed, going on to say that heavy spending would not be ne­ cessary now. 
As Monfrey left the party for a brief trip to a TV o u tle t, h is c a m p a ig n manager. Bill Miller, added an analy­ sis for reporters. 
He ex p resse d co n fid en ce M onfrey could pick up a lion ’s sh a re of San 
Martin’s vote in Mexican-American precincts. 
“ Two y ea r s a g o ,” he noted, “ the precincts which went for San Martin today fell in behind John.” He added: 
“ I look forward to an enjoyable two w eek s.” 
As for the huge throng of Monfrey 
’ su p p o r te r s, th ey had an e n jo y a b le night. Beer was available at three lo­ cations. Those who felt hunger pangs could work through a buffet of Mexican delicacies. And there was a cash bar 
(proceeds to go to the cam paign) for the ultra sophisticated. 

There w ere three exceptions to the upbeat reaction to the night’s events. 

Those were the owners of three cars which strayed innocently into an em p ­ ty lot patrolled by a wrecker operator. 

Towed away 
Late iii the evening it was announced the cars had been spirited off to an undisclosed lot. But owners were pub­ licly promised: 

“ John Monfrey will pay any costs to return them. Just bring us your k eys.” 

Monfrey him self had a word about the wrecker swoop, suggesting he will take action on the problem if elected. 

“ That’s the kind of contract the city has g o t . ” he sn a p p e d . “ T h o se tow tr u c k s h id e r ig h t a c r o s s from the lots.” 

Billa vs. 
Dutmer in Dist. 3 

Bv ALAN BAILEY 

Southeast San Antonio voters sent incumbent City Councilman Bob Billa into a runoff Saturday again st c h a l­ lenger Mrs. Helen Dutmer. 
Voting throughout the precin cts of 
District 3 was light with a little more than 3o per cent of the people casting ballots. 
“ I think the light turnout was a fac­ tor. A h e a v ie r tu rnout w ould h av e helped m e." said Billa at his cam paign h ea d q u a rters at 2931 E. Sn u th cross 
Blvd. 
Mrs. Dutmer, of 739 McKinley Ave., led eigh t ch a llen g e rs in m ak in g the runoff against Billa. 
Very tired 

“ I'm a very tired girl, but I'm going to give it all I ve got for the people of the South Side in the r u n o ff,’’ said 
Mrs. Dutmer. 
Trailing a poor third am ong the nine candidates w as Glen Horton, 37, of 249 
A rchim edes Drive, who adm itted d e­ feat at his cam paign headquarters at 
2817 E. Snuthcross Blvd. 
“ I got a late start — only three w eeks ago — so Mrs. D utm er probably d e ­ serves to be in the runoff. She’s worked longer. 
“ But I think this election was a ease of m oney buying the votes. Just look who finished first, second and third, and i f s the sam e way the money was spent,” said Horton. 
Endorse 

Horton said he would endorse one of the candidates, but he would announce his support later. 
Billa admitted he didn’t run as well in som e parts of District 3 as he would have liked. “ I thought I’d do better in the D ellcrest and Highland Park a r­ eas,” he said. 
As for the runoff. Billa said, “ Mrs. 
Dutmer will be tough to beat. She has a strong following, but I think if we stick to the issues, I w in .” 
Mrs. D utm er disagreed. When asked if she thought she would win the run­ off, she said, “ Without a doubt. And I hope I do for the sake of the people of the South Side. 
“ The runoff will be com pletely dif­ ferent race. T here’ll be more facts and more issu es,” said Mrs. Dutmer. 
Mrs. Dutm er also said she is hoping to pick up the endorsem ents of most of the other losing candidates in the race. 
“ Many of them have already given me indications they will support m e," said Mrs. Dutmer. 
Billa noted one reason for the runoff was because he had eight opponents all running against him. 
Other District 3 candidates trailing far behind B illa . M rs. D u tm er and 
Horton, were Leo Hahn, John Druskin. 
Gary VV. YVoitena, Stall Fulcher, Jim 
Lister and Bonnie Sunvison.

 chatted with cam p aign w orkers in a 
1oth floor suite of his Airport Trave- 
Lodge. 

D em ent said “ having to run against the E x p r e ss-N e w s” hurt him as did alleg atio n s that he had a sso cia tio n s with Morris Jaffe and Oscar Wyatt, the c o n tr o v e r s ia l c h a ir m a n of C o a sta l 
States Gas Corp. 

“ Big deal. So I know Morris J a ffe,” 
D em en t c o m m en ted with a tin g e of bitterness. 

A r c h e r , w h o w a s s u p p o r te d bv former long-tim e mayor VV. W. McAl­ lister. said he w as surprised he ran second and also surprised he didn't make the runoff. 

A ssessin g his defeat, Archer said, 
“ The new spapers were fair and I had s o m e go od v o lu n te e r s. I ju st d o n ’t think p eo p le p erceiv ed H artm an as being the liberal that he is. I wish him w ell.” 

Credits volunteers 

Hartman credited his victory to an o r g a n iz a tio n of v o lu n t e e r s “ th at h u m m e d .” He w as the lead in g vote getter iii all of the 23 voting precincts that m ake up Council District 9. 

“ I had lots of help from wonderful people,” Hartman said as he mingled with cam paign workers iii his cram ped quarters o11 Oblate Drive. 

O b v io u s ly p le a s e d w ith h is w in , 
Hartman said he was not too surprised because of the ground work that had been done at the precinct level. 

A 48-year-old retired in te llig e n c e planner with the D epartm ent of D e­ fense and a strong advocate of plan­ ning at City Hall, Hartman had his own campaign well-planned. 

At mid-afternoon he was predicting victory w ithout a runoff and a vote total of about 8,ooo. He got just more than that amount. 

Campaign workers 

U sing figures called iii by workers from the voting precincts, he and his cam paign workers — such people as 
M ary E lle n A u g u s tin e , o p e r a tio n s coordinator; Bill Dodds, issu es coor­ dinator; and T om m ye Brennan, press secretary — knew .3o minutes after the polls closed he had won. 

They cheered and laughed as radio returns cam e iii with the much slower tabulations from City Hall — broad­ c a sts that said it still looked like a runoff. 

The victory under his belt, Hartman sa id he w ill w ork for M a y o r L ila 
Cockrell in her runoff. 

The fourth candidate in the race was 
Roy A. B e n d e le J r ., who filed but never surfaced during the cam paign and got only a fractional percentage of the vote.

The pair won their positions over six other candidates entered in the near-South Side race. 
Eureste, 33, is an as­ sistant professor at Our 
Lady of the Lake Univer­ sity. In a platform state­ ment previous to the election, Eureste said the primary concerns for 
District 5 drainage and street improvements as well as a need for more public facilities and transportation. 
Chapa. 39, project dir­ ector for Mexican-Amer- ican Neighborhood Civic

Bist. 7 runoff needed 

By DAVID 
HENDRICKS 
City Councilman R i­ chard Teniente was ap­ prehensive about a runoff 
Saturday, and when the votes were counted he was right, and facing a runoff in District 7 with 
Joe Alderete Jr. 
At his headquarters 
Saturday night, the in­ cumbent said he had hoped to take a vacation with his family next week. but he would have to postpone it. two weeks. 
Teniente carried all but two of 2o precincts. 
One of those was the Holy 
Family Church precinct he expected to lose. 
Holy Family was the site of the Communities 
Organized for Public 
Service Accountability 
Night at which Alderete was the most popular candidate. 

D ay off 
Wearing a gray, pin­ striped suit. Teniente addressed his campaign helpers and supporters. 
“ I’m going to give you a day off,” he said, “ Then gear yourselves for a runoff." 
He also told his sup­ porters to concentrate on the weak precincts. 
“ And to those areas we won big. we’ll .just give them a shot of B12 and get them out to vote again next time." he ad­ ded. 
At 
Alderete head­ quarters. the challenger was expressing excite­ ment. at the prospects of the runoff and seemed proud of the two boxes he carried as well as the nine boxes in which he finished in second place. 
In addition to carrying the Holy Fam ily pre­ cinct. he also carried his home precinct. Forest 
Hills. 
Both Teniente’s and 
Alderete’s poll watchers reported Teniente re ceived roughly 4o per cent of Hie vote to Alder ete’s 33 per cent. 

G ra ss roots 
Wearing a blue, pin striped suit. Alderete said he intended to con­ tinue the same sort of grass-roots campaign he already had going, only with more people in valved in the runoff race 

" I will try to gather the support of the other can­ didates who showed a negative attitude toward an ABC (Alliance for a 
Better City) candidate like Teniente," Alderete said. 
Alderete said he thinks 
Teniente is an ABC can­ didate because 
Ten­ iente’s advertising is by the Pitluk Group, the same as ABC’s, and be­ cause Teniente’s expen­ ditures reflect more sup­ port than the councilman can personally afford. 
The other major candi­ date was 
Mike 
Fernandez, who gar­ nered about a quarter of the votes. 
Other candidates in the 
District 7 race included 
Nancy Olivares, Andres 
Gonzalez, Robert Tate and Richard Kopsky.

J ubilant scores bi win 

He first planned to run for mayor this year but a poll early in the cam­ paign, he said , convinced him he lacked the nam e identification and financial resources to win. 

In the city’s second most affluent district, Steen 'won a comparatively easy v ictory over four opponents. 

By MIKE ULLMANN 
The District IO victory party started early at John Steen’s campaign headquarters Satur­ day night. 

Workers staffing every precinct in the d istrict quickly reported Steen winning three to one over his closest opponent, Helen R. Walter. 
Steen, 55, is president and owner of 
Steen Insurance Group and has been an active civic leader. 
Webb faces Williams in Bist. 3 runoff 

About a fourth of the district's 4o,928 registered voters cast their ballots for 
.Steen, he said. 

Interv iewed Saturday night after his' v ictory became apparent, Steen said it is very important to look at the city's problems as a whole and not just focus on District IO. 
Irate calls 

 boys’ — with people.*' 
Williams, who recieved the support and endorsement of City Councilman 
Claude Black, said the crowded field of candidates in District 2 hurt him. 
“ We didn't anticipate a runoff in the beginning of the campaign,” Williams said. “ But the three late filers really hurt us. 
“ It’s pretty hard to take the election in a runaway when you have to split the votes behind among nine people.” 
Williams moved his campaign head­ q u a rte rs late S a tu rd a y to A bie’s 
Corner at the corner of Houston and 
H ackberry streets, for a “ strategy party." 
“ W e've now entered the second phase of the election — tin4 runoff. I want to urge my people to work harder now than they did in the first phase.” 
Williams said he had set up a meet­ ing with Coy to urge the third-runner to throw his support to Williams. 
He wasn't alone. Webb set up a late 
S aturd ay m eetin g with Coy at his headquarters to seek the sam e sup­ port. 
Webb said, “ I don't know how Coy is going to go. I hope he goes for me, that's for sure.” 
Attempts to contact Coy late Satur­ day were futile. A campaign worker said he was meeting with Webb. 
“ This does put us in a enviable po­ sition.” the worker said. “ I can’t say, at this time, which way we will go. We will just have to talk to both Webb and 
Williams first. 
“ Then we will make up our minds.’’ 
East Side voters will have the final say two weeks from now, but the two black candidates in the runoff will de­ pend on a Mexican-American for the outcome. 

By DAVID MCLEMORE 
The East Side District 2 council race stormed into a runoff between two* strong contenders out of a field of nine 
Saturday. 
.Joe W ebb, 41, a g ro cery sto re manager, led vote counts throughout the night over Charles Williams, 39, although W ebb’s m argin rarely ex­ ceeded 6oo voters. 
Alfredo Coy, 33, ran a surprise third with a 2-to-l margin behind the two front runners 
Both Webb and Williams, eyeing the runoff election two weeks away, both contacted Coy Saturday night to set up meetings to gain his support. 
M urrene Gilford, 52, considered prime candidate for the third place spoiler position before election day, ran a disappointing fourth. 
The other five candidates for the 
District 2 council slot were never in the running. 
, 
Webb, sitting in his campaign office, said, “ I felt sure all along we would take it and the prospect ‘oi a runoff doesn’t surprise me one bit. 
“ I had good people working for me. 
That’s how we beat the ‘big money 
Strikers make 8oo travelers unhappy 

NEW VORK TIMES SERVICE 

NEW YORK — Some 8oo arriving voyagers were delayd leaving a Hud­ son River pier Saturday and had to drag heavy luggage off the ship as a result of a four-hour wildcat strike by 
3oo longshoremen. 
The stoppage also threatened to delay the departure of four cruise ships. 

Laughing, he reflected that making that rem ark earlier in the campaign resulted in a flood of irate phone calls rem inding him that D istrict IO has problems, too. 
He listed roads, parks, recreational facilities, transportation and libiaries as areas of concern in his district. 
Calling him self a “ growth candi­ date,” he said the city needs better fiscal management, economic growth and more job opportunities. 
Growth 
“ If we can get more growth, it will help solve many of the other problems, such as employment,'' he said. 
Steen said he spent a little over 
$7,5oo on his cam paign, including 
$3,9oo to decide he should not run for mayor. 
He said Citizens Organized for Pub­ lic Service, although so m e tim e s rowdy, has done a good job pointing out ignored problems on the West Side. 
Huebner good 
Steen also said new City Mgr. Tom 
Huebner seems to be a good financial manager and said he dues not expect any problems with the manager. 
The other four candidates in District 
IO were trailing far behind Steen as final election results came in. 
District results by percentage were: 
Steen-73.7 per cent, Walter-9.6 per cent, Bill Healey-8.6 per cent, Paul M. 
-Foley-5.9 per cent, and Art Phillips-2.2 per cent.

 linked to 'Hunt’ letter 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
D ALLAS—Federal investiga­ tors say they do not know who the recipient was, but three handwriting experts say a Nov. 
8, 1963, letter to a “ Mr. Hunt” was written by Lee Harvey Os­ wald. 
The three an alysts were c o m m is­ sioned by the Dallas Morning News, which reported Saturday that the letter was compared with known sam ples of 
Oswald's handwriting from documents in the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy. 
Oswald was identified by the Warren 
Commission as the person who fatally shot Kennedy here Nov. 22, 1963. The commission said Oswald acted alone. • 
The Dallas bureau of the F B I has said it is investigating a letter purpor­ tedly written by Oswald to a “ Mr. 
H unt.” A spok esm an said the F B I cannot say for whom the letter was intended. 
Examination 
A spokesman for the estate of the late Dallas oilman H L. Hunt issued a statement Friday saying that reports that Hunt had something to do w ith the assassin ation were “ totally fa lse .” 
Earlier, a spokesman for Hunt Oil Co. denied that the late billionaire “ ever knew. ever communicated with or ever received com m unication from Lee 
Harvey Oswald.” 
The News identified the handwriting experts as Mary C. H arrison of R i­ chardson. Tex., Mary I. Duncan of To­ ronto, Canada, and Allan R. Keown of 
El Paso, Tex. The newspaper said all three are certified with the Internatin- al Graphoanalysis Society and were alerted to watch specifically for any signs of forgery. 
“ We have made a careful exam ina­ tion and comparison of all the writing and find that it com pares,” the three said in a signed statement reported by the newspaper. 

District 4 runoff 

By LYNN LAIR 
Frank Wing and Johnny Mala will sq u are off April IR in a. runoff race for the City Council seat from South Side District 4. 
Wind led Mata by a margin of 2-1, but votes from six other candidates forced a runoff. 
“ Whew, I'm tired,” said Wing. 31. 

“ But we beat those South Side guys right there in their own backyard, we beat them real bad. 
“ Naturally, we went into the race expecting to win, with either Mata or 
Jim m y Flores our stiffest competitors. 
“ We’re not disappointed, just tired.” said Wing of his reveling cam paign workers. 
“ But we'll take Mata hands down next time. No problem, we'll get him.”

The newspaper also reported that 
Marina Oswald. Oswald’s widow, tes­ tified before the Warren Commission in September, 1964 that Oswald told her Nov. 8. 1963. that “ there was an­ other .lob open, m ore in te r e stin g work.” She said he later told her the job concerned photography and he learned of the opening through a new­ sp ap er ad v ertisem en t. 
No wonder car was a complete wreck 

EL RENO, Okla. (AP) - Kenneth J . 
Skopek, 43, Lemont, 111., was hospita­ lized Saturday after he drove a rented car through three-fourths of a mile of wheat field, a six-foot ehain-link fence, the west and north walls of an airport hanger and a steel support beam. 
Police said Skopek was not hurt seriously but that his ear was a total loss, 2o(1 feet of fence was down, two airplanes were damaged and it would cost $11o,ooo to fix the hangar at 
Cimarron Airport. 
Skopek. who said lie was headed from Kansas City to Fort Worth, told police he couldn’t rem ember anything. 

Keown said Saturday he compared the “ Mr. Hunt" letter with the second page of another letter allegedly written by Oswald. Keown said, “ I concluded that the sa m e hand w rote both documents. I cannot say that Lee Har­ vey Oswald wrote the letter because I didn’t see him write the letter, but I can say it was written by the sa m e hand.” 
The text of the letter says: “ I would like information concerning my posi­ tion. I am asking only for information. 
I am suggesting that we discu ss the matter fully before any steps are taken by me or anyone else.” 
Letter’s source 
Retired n ew sp ap er ed ito r Penn 
Jones Jr. of Midlothian told The News he obtained the letter through the mail from an unidentified p erso n from 
Mexico City. He said the sender told him that he had given a copy of the letter to FBI Director Clarence Kelley in late 1974. An P’BI spokesm an has said the bureau knows nothing about the alleged delivery of the letter, and received a copy “ recently.” 
Jones said FBI agents cam e to his home this week with portable phto- graphic equipment to photograph his copy of the letter. 

By ED KINGSHOTT 

Social worker Rudy Ortiz and attor­ ney Robert Thompson will face each other in a runoff for the District 6 council post. 
Ortiz outpolled Thompson by almost 
65(1 votes in the Southwest Side district. 
In cu m b en t City C o u n cilm an Al 
Rohde finished a distant fifth in the nine-man field. 
Rohde, who moved into District 6 from District IO to mount his cam ­ paign, blamed his defeat on a poor voter turnout. 
“ He’s a populist candidate and the majority of the people didn’t come out to vote.” said Ms. Elaine Lieck, his campaign strategist. “ The sun shone and the people stayed home.” 
Ortiz took the early lead and stayed in front after that. 
“ We expected a runoff but not betw een m e and T h o m p so n , but between me and (Je sse ) Diaz,” Ortiz said. 
Supports Ortiz 
Diaz, who finished third, said he was now supporting Ortiz. 
“ There were too many candidates in tilt1 race." said the 33-year-old Ortiz, a social worker and counsellor at St. 
Philip's College. 
“ The electorate displayed a certain amount of indecision and it shows. 
“ Now we do have a choice,” Ortiz said. " I t ’s now a m atter of 18 years of 

 residency versus six years and let the people decide.” 
Thompson, a form er Legal Aid at­ torney, said: 
“ We’re very grateful to be in second. 
We’re grateful we're in the runoff. 
“ I ’m d isa p p o in te d in the 
M e xiean -A m erican vote turnout. I spent over $8oo in that area to take only 
8o votes. 
“ It seem s we didn't relate to them, and I'm very concerned about that,” the 36-year-old attorney said. 
U n o fficial re tu rn s show ed Ortiz c lo b b erin g 
T h om pson in the p red o m in an tly M e xican -A m e rican precincts in the Edgewood arca. 

Ortiz beat Thompson by almost 8oo votes in preeints near Edgewood High 
School, according to unofficial returns. 
Thompson won big in his home pre­ cinct in the Yalley-Hi area. Unofficial returns there gave Thompson a 4o2 to 
17 vote victory over Ortiz in Precinct 
131, Thompson's home precinct. 

Thompson said he would now seek the support of Rohde. Kay Brown, who finished fourth with more than 1,ooo votes, and Ja m e s Kelly, who tallied 531 votes. 

Rohde, however, said he so far had no plans to endorse any candidate. 
“ I ve got to read the political tea leaves.” he said. 

D istric t 4 lo se rs Rani P erez and 
Manuel F lo res prom ised Wing their support in the runoff. 
“ N othing’s ch an g ed ,” said W ing,’ 
“ we’ll just work harder. We expect enough voters to turn out. This race can generate enough enthusiasm to get the voters back in two weeks.” 
“ We’ll work us hard as we did for this election, it’s just a little shorter time to prepare," Wing said. “ But we have a broad base of community sup­ port. 
“ We are thankful for all the support in the district, and I want to thank everybody that helped in the c a m ­ paign.” 

Sp irits were high at M a ta's head­ quarters, too. 
“ I knew Wing w as the guy to go after, but I think I did a good show for my first time out. said Mata, former 
San Antonio Toros and Wings football star. 
“ I'm no politician, but I’ve been here long enough to know it's going to take somebody strong and dedicated to get something done here on the South Side. 

Right time 
“ I decided to run because I feel Eve got everything going for me. it's the right time to get into the community where I ve always lived, unlike Wing. an unknown. 
“ A lot of people said if I could get to the runoff first, they’d see what they could do — influential South S id e ’ business people. 
“ I think I can win the runoff, and tomorrow I’m going to start planning: my strategy, start waking up a lot of people. 
Confident 
“ I feel real confident. I f s going to take tw ice as much work, but that ex­ tra effort is going to get us over that hump. 

“ I feel that my people did a super job in preparing for the election. There’s a few kinks we have to work out, but that's typical for a rookie. 
“ T h ere’s only two can didates now instead of nine, and things are going to improve in the next two weeks,” Mata said.

Searchers find bodies of airmen in B52 crash 

Pyramid seen in fTriangle’ 

GWINN, Mich. (AP) — 
Searchers using tracking dogs found the last of eight crewmen killed w hen the B-52 bom ber they had taken on a training flight crashed into a wooded area. 

The Friday night crash took the lives of all aboard the plane, the Air 
Force said. 
The bom ber, on its landing approach to K.I. 
Sawyer Air Force B ase near Marquette, Mich., plunged into a rem ote wooded area during a snowfall. 
Six of the bodies were recovered within hours after the crash . Heavy snow in the area h am ­ pered the continuing search, however, and the last two bodies were not 

 found until S atu rd ay evening, an Air F orce spokesman said. 
Col. William B. Norris, base commander, said a team of investigators was enroute to attem p t to determ ine the cau se of the crash.

AGfcNCE FRANCE FRESSE 

MEXICO CITY — A 6oo-foot high underwater pyramid has been reported discovered in the notorious Bermuda 
Triangle at the junction of the Atlantic and Caribbean at a depth of nearly 
3,ooo feet. 

Author Charles Berlitz said the dis­ 

 covery shows a highly developed an­ cient civilization once may have lived in the region. 
The triangle is an area covering thousands of square miles stretching from Berm uda to the southeast coast of the United States and the West Indies.

I ii an article by com mentator Alexander Bovill, the newspaper said the Soviet I ’ii ion was ready to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Limitation Talks — 
(SALT) — agreement with the United States, but only on the basis of “ an honest approach to busi­ ness.” 

Last Wednesday the Soviets turned down two pro­ posals brought to Moscow by Secretary of State 
Cyrus R. Vance. One called for “ deep cuts” in both countries’ nuclear arsenals; the other suggested that both sides accept a weapons ceiling agreed to by then-President Gerald R. Ford and Soviet leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1974. 

Izvestia said brith proposals would give the United 
States the edge in “ the general strategic balance.” 
“ In both cases, the Americans are trying to make big politics on cunning, on their striving to hoodwink the partner in the negotiations, and this is a most untrustworthy thing.” the newspaper said. 

The a rticle also cited “ in stab ility ” stem m ing from the change in administrations in Washington. 
“The fever shaking political Washington at least one year in four is fraught with the most unexpected consequences.” Izvestia said. “ What sort of stability is there if the word ‘detente’ is disowned for fear of the right-wingers? 

“ And what is to be done with trust if. without bringing one thing to an end, and discarding care­ fully weighed balancing of interests, hasty, ill-con­ sidered proposals that are far from realistic are tossed about?”

Vance trip labeled productive 

WASHINGTON (A P ) 
— Secretary of State Cy­ rus R. V ance returned home S a tu rd a y night from his u n su cce ssfu l n u clea r a rm s ta lk s in 
Moscow to be greeted at the airport by President 
Carter. 
The President, joined by his wife, shook hands with Vance. The two men then walked to a m icro­ phone and addressed a small group of reporters. 
C a rter said V a n c e ’s mission was “ a very dif­ ficult undertaking” and that despite the Moscow failure he will pursue the quest for a com prehen­ sive a rm s co n tro l agreement. 
“ Our whole a d m in is ­ tration will be devoting a great effort for the con­ tinuation of talks” with the 
Russians, 
Carter said. 
V ance told re p o r te r s that a rm s control is a long-range process and the initial failure will be overcome. 
Productive 

Even if there was “ no p ro g ress” in s tra te g ic a re a s, V ance said , the trip n e v e rth e less was productive in other m at­ ters. 
(’arter agreed with that assessment and said the goal of a strategic arms limitation treaty is “ one we will pursue.” 
Vance and Carter will meet at the White House for an hour and 45 min­ utes Sunday afternoon to 

 d iscu ss the trip , and 
Vance will brief the con­ gressional foreign re la ­ tions committees later in the week. 
The 
P r e s id e n t’s unusual greeting at An­ drews A F B in suburban 
Maryland seemed an ef­ fort to o v e rco m e tile adverse reaction to the 
Vance mission. 
Reporters accom pany­ ing the secretary could not recall a sim ilar in­ stance in recent y e a rs when a president has met a secretary of state’s air­ plane. 
Unusual 
P resid en ts g en erally do not meet a secretary of state’s airplane after an overseas mission. The last such in sta n ce o c ­ curred in September 1975 when then-President Ge­ rald R. F ord g re eted ll airy A. Kissinger's ar­ rival from a Middle East trip. 
“ I b eliev e 
S ov iets leaders ultim ately will ag ree with us 
... to re d u ce ” n u cle a r weapons, he said, adding 
“ we will do everything we can to strengthen the ties of m utual resp ect w ith the Soviet Union.” 
Carter then went on to say, “ I want to express my thanks to Mr. Brezh­ nev (Soviet party leader 
Leonid B re z h n ev ) and 
Mr. Gromyko (Foreign 
Minister Andrei Grom y­ ko) ... for th e ir very productive” attitude in many areas. 
Arms proposals called trickery 

MOSCOW (A P ) — T h e Sov iet g o v ern m e n t newspaper Izvestia accused the United States Sa­ turday of trying to “ hoodwink” the Kremlin with 
“ hasty, ill-considered proposals” for controlling strategic weapons.

People ask fo r Carter9 get Costanza 

WASHINGTON (AP) - By the time Mary Ann 
Aiello and Peggy Clark of Rockford. IU., finally reached the White House, they had spent $5oo on telephone calls to Washington trying to deliver a petition to President Carter. 
Their persistence and investment got them a peek at the Oval office, when the President wasn’t there, and a 75-minute chance to air their g rip es with 
Midge Costanza, one of the President’s top aides. 
Their reception was exceptionally w arm , cam- pared to most m em bers of the public seeking to present their views to the President. But their case provides a look at how the White House handles citizens who carry petitions to the executive mansion where job hunters and anyone else with a gripe or occasional word of praise seek to make their feelings and problems known to the President of the United 
Stales. 
Constitutional right 
They are. after all, just carrying out a constitu­ tional right: “ Congress shall m ake no law . .abri ding. . .the right of the people peaceably to assem ­ ble. and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,” says the First Amendment. 
.The White House has no organized procedure for dealing with petitions, but most of them reach Ms. 
Costanza, whose office is just a few paces down a hallw ay from C a r t e r ’ s. She c o n sid e r s h erself 
Carter’s liaison with organized groups of Americans wishing to get a point across to the President. 
So, the petitions M iss Aiello and M rs. ( lurk brought to the White House one day last month opposing deregulation of natural gas prices reached her office. 
On other days she has dealt, for instance, with amnesty for Vietnam war resisters, aid for Vietnam, the Bl bomber and nuclear disarmament. 
The petitions, arriving by mail or carried to the 
White House by their sponsors, usually bear thou­ sands of signatures. 
When a petition arrives at the White House gates. a staff member often picks it up and speaks briefly with the sponsors. 
“ I go out. I don’t just take the petitions. I talk. I get to know them, and I tell them I appreciate they’re taking part in the government.’’ said Ms. 
Costanza, who prefers the “ Ms.” designation. 
Vehicle 

“ I’m sorry the need for petitioning is necessary in our society, but it is a vehicle through which people can explain their position to the President,” Ms. 
Costanza told Miss Aiello and Mrs. Clark. “ I pro­ mise you the President will know about the peti­ tions.” 
She said she would write him a m em orandum based on what the women told her about tile hard­ ships that in creases in natural g a s prices were causing in Rockford, a city of approximately 15o.ooo in northwestern Illinois. 
The women had one overriding goal: to make sure their views were heard before the President s en­ ergy policy, expected to be announced by April 2o. is completed. 
To that end, Ms. Costanza invited a representative of Carter’s energy adviser, .James R. Schlesinger, to the m eeting, and S c h lesin g er’s aide took notes throughout the session. 
Miss Aiello, who works a night shift straightening tool bits at a machine and tool company, and Mrs. 
Clark, a housewife with three teen-aged daughters, said their petitions bore the signatures of 25,ooo residents of the Rockford area. 
They said they feared that if Carter, in the energy plan, removed price regulation of natural gas, they would no longer be ab le to afford to heat their homes. 
As they told their tale of rising prices and lowered thermostats, Ms. Costanza prodded them to keep the meeting on track. 
Assistant's office 

While Schlesinger’s aide took notes, Ms. Costanza sat at a table with the women in an assistant’s office, watching the two ladies intently, her hands at first in prayer position, then at her mouth, then providing a support for her chin. 
Ms. Costanza had chosen her aide’s office in the 
Old Executive Office Building next door to the White 
House because her office was characteristically so cluttered with papers that it left little room for v isitors. She often worked seated on her couch with papers spread out on the cushions. 
“ Som e of the things that frustrate you are the things that frustrate m e.” she told the women, but said that in her job of helping the President receive comments from a wide variety of citizens, “ I cannot 
In* an advocate for or against an issue.” 
Like many of those who bring petitions to the 
White House, the two women wanted to see the 
President They opened their meet mg asking to see him and they closed it with the sam e request. 
“ A lot of iK'ople have faith in President Carter. We appreciate this meeting, but I don’t think the people at home feel it carries any weight.” Miss Aiello said. 
” rile least ho could do is take five minutes with us.” 
But each time the plea was made. Ms. Costanza left them no hope for such a meeting. 
“ I assure you the President will get your views.” she told them. “ His .schedule is set up weeks in advance. Ile is paying us good money to do this for him. What are you trying to do? Lose my job for m e?”

Airlines put up bump warnings 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Airline passengers will find new signs at ticket counters Sunday warning them they might be bumped from a flight. 
The warning also will be printed on all.tickets and displayed at travel agent offices. 
The Civil Aeronautics Board issued the temporary ruling a month agt), to be effective beginning 
Sunday. The CAB said it would decide whether to make the order permanent after examining several overbooking cases now before it. That might take several months. 
The ruling applies to all airlines, foreign and domestic, but covers only tickets sold in the United 
States. 
Warning 
The CAB said the warning must read: “ Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seal may not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. A person denied boarding on a flight may be entitled to a com pensatory paym ent. The rules for denied boarding compensation are available at all airport ticket counters.” 
Under the new CAB rule, an airline must take a passenger with reservations who is denied boarding to his destination within two hours after the orginal flight’s arrival, or reimburse him up to $2oo. The passenger can also keep the ticket and use it later. 
The CAB recently reported that of 15.124 consumer complaints it received in 1975, some 1.192 came from ticket-holding passengers upset when they were denied a seat because the airline had overbooked the flight. 
Increased 
The board said that in 1974, 5.8 passengers of every 1o,ooo who boarded flights were bumped be­ cause of overbooking. In 1975, the board said this increased to 7 of every 1o,ooo. 
The airline companies say they often must over­ sell tickets to compensate for travelers who make reservations they don’t keep.

WASHINGTON (A P) - The sun's clean and inexhaustible power can supply 4o per cent of the world’s en­ ergy needs within 25 years and 75 per cent in 5o years if a drive to develop it starts now . a new study says. 
“ Every essential feature of the pro­ posed solar tra n sitio n has already proven technically viable,” says the study by Denis Hayes, researcher for the Worldvvatch Institute, a private think-tank on global resource p ro b ­ lems. The study was published Satur­ day. 
“ lf the 5o-year tim e ta b le is not m et.” Hayes wrote, “ the roadblocks will have been political — not techni­ cal.” 
Major shifts 
Many energy experts believe world production of oil and natural gas will peak around 199o and then decline, knocking the props out from under the present petroleum -based industrial societies and forcing major shifts to other energy sources. 
President Carter and his top energy 

Solar energy may reduce or eliminate many environm ental problem s and would last as long as the sun itself 

 adviser, Jam es R. Schlesinger. have based their energy policy on conserva­ tion measures and a shift to coal and nuclear power — systems that pose acknowledged environmental and sa­ fety concerns. 
Solar energy — using the heat and light that reaches the earth from the sun to do the jobs now done by burning fuels — may reduce or eliminate many environm ental problem s and would last as long as the sun itself. 
But so far it has been generally con­ sidered a distant and probably minor source of energy. 
Hayes challenges that view. Hayes concedes that solar power may never be cheap because it requires costly equipm ent. But he claim s it could meet most or all of society’s energy 

 demands, provided those demands are geared to take advantage of it. 
Another study released last month concluded that solar energy will he the cheapest way to warm homes and heat water in the northern regions of the 
United States by 198o because oil and gas prices will continue to increase there. 
T hat Study be re se a rc h ers at the 
University of New Mexico assum ed that Congress will act to remove fe­ deral price limits on gas and oil. 
The Hayes study said most of the energy budgets of both the United 
States ^and Canada could “ easily and economically he met using existing solar technologies.” 
Variety 
Hayes says solar power could be tapped in a variety of ways: direct use of heat from the sun; photoelectric conversion of solar radiation into elec­ tricity; converting plant crops and other biological materials into fuels: or 

 harnessing the power of winds, waves, and falling water, all set in motion by the sun’s heat. 
The key to adoption of solar power. 
Hayes says, lies in adapting industrial processes and other energy systems to use the kind of energy offered by the sun: widespread, low-intensity energy, available only d u rin g the day and sharply reduced by clouds. 
But Hayes says large am ounts of energy, even in industry, are the kind the sun could provide, such as relatively low temperature heating be­ low the boiling point of water. 

Foolishness 

“ The use of nu clear re a c to rs operating at a million degrees C (Cel­ sius) to make electricity lo run re ­ sidential waster heaters to provide bath water at 3o degrees C (about 86 de­ grees Fahrenheit) is surely the height of thermodynamic foolishness,’’ Hayes writes. 
He said that roughly 34 per cent of energy consumed in the United States is employed as heat at tem peratures under IOO degrees C (boiling). Hayes said solar energy could easily provide that heat, in place of the oil. gas, coal and nuclear fuel now burned.

Proselytism rejection is welcomed 

N EW YORK TIMES SERVICES 

NEW VORK — Interfaith experts are hailing the outcome of the sixth meeting of the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison 
Committee in Venice at which Catholic participants lined up behind a position that strongly condemns all forms of prosely­ tism. 
The declaration, the most explicit rejection of proselytism in modern times, is expected to help remove one of the principal obstacles to better 
Catholic-Jewish relations. 
The legacy of forced conversion of Jew s has posed formidable problems for ecumenical talks even as the climate between the two faiths has warmed since the Second Vatican Council. 
The Catholic position was articulated by Prof. 
Tomasso Federici of the Pontifical Urbaniana Uni­ versity. who is an adviser lo the seven-member church delegation. 
Federici denounced proselytism and organizations of any sort that aim at conversion of Jews. Consi­ derable tensions have developed over such groups in the United States in the last few years. 
Church rejects 
“ The church rejects in a clear way every form of proselytism,” the professor said in his address, the main study paper of the session from March 28 to 3o. 
He continued: “ This means the exclusion of any sort of witness and preaching which in any way constitutes a physical, moral, psychological or cul­ tural constraint on the Jews, both individuals and communities, such as might in any way destroy or even simply reduce their personal judgment, free will and full autonomy of decision at the personal or community level.” 
Federici also reiterated the Second Ecumenical 
Council’s condemnation of anti-Semitism and af­ firmed the deep historical ties between Judaism as a living tradition and the life of the church. 
While the Catholic participants do not officially speak for the church, the prestige of the delegation lends its views far-reaching significance and com­ mends them as compatible with Vatican thinking. 
Among the leading churchmen in the delegation is the vice president of the Vatican Secretariat for 
Promoting Christian Unity, Bishop Ramon Torrella. 
Rabbi Henry Siegman of the Synagogue Council of 
America, one of the Jewish participants, said that the results of the meeting marked “ a historical turning point in the relations of the Catholic Church and the Jewish people.” 
Deeply ingrained 
He added: “ The memory of forced conversions is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the Jewish people and has been the most serious obstacle in the development of Christian-Jeuish relations. 
Appeals for a strong stand against proselytism have been made by Jewish leaders since Vatican ll ushered in a new era of understanding between the two faiths. 
But the original council documents on relations with Jew s and 1975 Vatican guidelines on Jewish- 
Catholic relations stopped short of taking an explicit position on proselytism. 
Initial Catholic reaction from ecumenical officials here was positive. “ Urn delighted,” said the Rev. 
John Peter Sheehan, associate director of the United 
States Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious 
Affairs. 
Sadat, Carter to open talks : 

WASHINGTON (A P)

Anwar Sadat is expected to ask for U.S. arms and for a detailed explanation of the administration’s 
Middle East peace plans in his talks this week with President Carter. 

The first Arab leader to meet face to face with 
Carter since his inaugur­ ation, Sadat is known to be determined to probe 
C arter's concept of a 
“ homeland” for P ales­ tinian refugees as well as 
“ defensible borders” for 
Israel. 
Sadat also wants

San Antonio EXPRE5S-NEWS -—Sunday April 3 I977 
21 suffering from botulism 

PONTIAC, Mich. (A P ) — Author­ ities confirmed on Saturday that botu­ lism toxin brought on the outbreak of food poisoning that affected 21 persons who had eaten at a Mexican restaur­ ant. 
Health authorities say it is the third worst outbreak of botulism poisoning in I .S. history. 
The Center for Disease Control in 
Atlanta discovered the potentially fatal poison in a specimen flown to the 

 center Thursday, health officials said. 
The specimen was taken from one of the persons hospitalized after eating at 
Trim and C arm en ’s restau ran t in downtown Pontiac, just outside De­ troit. 
Three physicians announced Satur­ day that botulism was the cause of the food poisoning. They were Oakland 
County Health Director Dr. Robert 
Looey, Dr. Will Terranova of the CDL and Dr. .Joel Brem en of the Michigan 

Health Department. 
Four of the 21 were in critica, but stable, condition. 
Authorities have tentatively blamed a batch of home canned green peppers tfor the outbreak. 
Food served at the restaurant both on Monday and Tuesday may have been tainted, officials said. The res­ taurant, which has no history of sim i­ lar problem s, was ordered closed 
Thursday evening after the county 

 health department was informed of the poisoning. 
After confiscating nearly 15o ja rs of the suspected peppers, authorities say they believe the entire stock is a c­ counted for. An investigation deter­ mined the contaminated peppers were used in hot sauce made Monday, officials said. The restaurant manager said a new batch of sauce was made on 
Tuesday, but health officials feared that may have been contaminated as 

 well since it apparently was made in the same bowl. 

CDG statistics indicate the worst outbreak of the disease in the United 
States occurred in Michigan in 1921 when 29 persons were stricken with botulism poisoning after eating spin­ ach. In 1983, 23 persons in the Midwest 
—- including some from Michigan — became ill from botulism in smoked whitefish.

WYCHE FOWLER JR. 

I 

JOHN R. LEWIS 
Pro, novice battling for 
House seat 

ATLANTA (AP) — Two men in their mid-3os. ope a veteran politician and the other a candidate for the first time, meet Tuesday in a runoff election for the congressional seat vacated by I N. A m bassador 
Andrew Young. 
. The race ends more than two months of nonstop cam paigning by Atlanta City Council President 
Wyche Fowler Jr. and John R. Lewis, form er head of the Voter Education Project. 
Fowler got 39.4 per cent of the vote in a March 15 non-partisan election and Lewis 28.8 per cent to outdistance IO other candidates. Both are Demo­ crats. 
Fowler, 36. ran unssuccesfully against Young in 
1972 for the Democratic nomination in the sam e congressional district — the 5th — which includes 
Atlanta and is about 57 per cent white and 43 per cent black. 
Ill I96o, he was elected to the city’s Board of 
Aldermen, and in 1973 he becam e the first president of the City Council. 
Lewis resigned as director of the Atlanta-based 
VEP, which has registered thousands of Southern blacks, to run for Congress. Ile had never before sought political office. 

Marched with 
He has. however, been on the edge of the political arena — heading the Student Nonviolent Coordinat­ ing Committee in the early 198os and m arching with the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Fowler is white. Lewis is black. 
Though some persons have tried to label the con­ test racial, both candidates disagree. 
; 
However, many Atlanta-area blacks have stressed 
! the importance of keeping a black in the seat which j Young, the first black congressm an elected from the 
Deep South since Reconstruction, won for a third term by a 87 per cent m argin in November. 
On the issu e s, little d iffe re n c e h a s s u rfa c e d between the two candidates. 
Both oppose capital punishm ent. Both want the lid removed from outside earnings of Social Security recipients. 
Lewis favors a study of nuclear energy prior to further development and a two-year ban on deve­ lopm ent. F ow ler w an ts an in d e p e n d e n t fed eral agency to search for new energy sources, but has 
“ grave reservations” about nuclear energy. 

Health insurance 

Fowler favors a health in su ran c e p ro g ra m for families facing disasters from medical bills. Lewis favors a comprehensive health program of medical coverage. 
One area where the two disagree is labor. Lewis favors “ com m on s it u s ” picketing, which would close down construction at a site where a union is striking, and repeal of right-to-work laws. Fowler opposes both. 
Both have tried to overcome labels that followed them out of the March 15 election. 
Lewis, who was unable to rally support behind himself as the black consensus can d id ate, visits black areas with com m ents like “ Don’t sell out to the power structure.” 
Fired say strike will continue 

ATLANTA 
(A P ) 
- 
S trik in g city w o rk e rs , fired on Friday by Mayor 
Maynard Jackson, vowed 
S aturday to rem a in on the picket line and en- courged residents not to cooperate with a city plan to collect mounting g a r­ bage. 
About 3(H) m em bers of the American Federation of S tate, County and 
Municipal E m ployes — 
AFSCME — union voted during a strategy session to continue the strike “ as long as it takes to get a m e a su re of eco n o m ic justice,” said spokesman 
Jim Gray. 
The union stru ck the city on Monday, seeking wage in c re a se s th a t would add $2o a week to the average blue collar workers 
$15o weekly paycheck. 
Jackson said the city could not afford the pay raise and Friday he fired more than 1,ooo of the s trik e rs , about 38 per cent of the city ’s 2,84o g a rb a g e m c n , s tr e e t rep a irm e n and o th e r workers, after they failed to meet his deadline for returning to work. 
Dignity 

The u n ion’s reg io n al representative. Leamon 
Hood, has said the strike will continue “ us long as necessary. This is not a nickel and dime m atter; this is a m atter of human dignity." 
The strik e p rim a rily has affected residential garbage collection. 
Jack so n o u tlin ed a contingency p lan for dealing with residential g arb ag e in a televised ad d re ss to A tla n ta r e ­ sidents Friday. The plan 
, calls for residents to haul 

 their own trash to desig­ n ated fire s ta tio n s , schools and sh o p p in g centers to be picked up by w orkers still on the job. 
But Gray said strikers plan “ to be at schools an d sh o p p in g c e n te r s w here the city intends to put receptacles, asking people not to do Maynard 
Jackson’s work for him .” 
Jackson said the city would begin alm ost im ­ m e d ia te ly to h ire r e p la c e m e n ts for th e fired w o rk e rs , b u t he gtffe no estim ate of when norm al resid e n tia l g a r ­ bage pickups would re ­ sume. 

Painful 

Jackson told reporters on Friday that firing the workers was “ the m ost painful and the most un­ pleasant task I have had to perform.” particularly because m any of th e m 
“ are the most needy, the lowest paid of ou r e m ­ ployes.” 

A sked r e p e a te d ly w hether th e re was any chance the workers could retain their jobs. Jackson sa id , “ T h e re a re no ] guarantees of rehiring,” b it he would not dism iss th a t p o ssib ility should the union and the city reach agreement. 

C o m m ercia l g a r b a g e c o n tra c to rs in the city h av e c o n tin u ed th e ir pickups so there has been no large accumulation of g a rb a g e on dow ntow n sidewalks. 

Jackson s a y s he blames the strike on na­ tional union o ffic ia ls r a th e r th a n local workers.

The SS.65 tab DID in­ clude two drinks — two of the most expensive on the me nu , a king-sized Gol­ den Cadillac and an Irish

Most of the drinks at th a t e s t a b l i s h m e n t a r e

A y e a r a fter his death no one weeps for m u ltim illion aire who d ied o f neglect 
— a p itifu l, em aciated figure 

 veiled Hughes’ recluse 

LOS A N G ELU S (A P ) 
— Howard Hughes died one year ago this week. 
And although no one weeps for him now . pas­ sions aroused by his death continue. 
“ We bring nothing into- this world and we can take nothing out,” in­ toned the minister at the burial of one of the world s richest men. 
Even as he spoke, the scramble for Howard 
Hughes’ fortune had begun. 
Now, a springtime later, disputes over the disposition of Hughes’ wealth clutter the courts of four states. Would-be inheritors have produced 
34 separate documents alleging to he the last will and testament of 
Howard Rohard Hughes. 
Distant relatives whose ties to the family recluse were tenuous for decades have stepped up to claim a share of the estate. So has an obscure gas sta­ tion owner from Utah. 
And two states which once knew Hughes as an invisible resident are battling over which one gets the inheritance taxes. 
Wealth disputed 

There is even a dispute about how rich Hughes really was. 
And so intense was his isolation that many had believed him dead for years. 
“ It ’s trag ic.’’ said 
Frank William Gay. pre­ sident of Hughes’ Summa 
Corp. 
“ I t s tragic 
Howard Hughes had to die to prove that he w as alive." 
At last, with the guar­ dians of his cloister dis­ missed, the vow of silence was broken. 

There were glimpses of the herm it’s life and confirmation of longheld suspicions that a dark and terrible secret lurked within the penth­ ouses and private planes of Hughes’ hidden world. 
Hughes, once a tall, dashing aviator and Hol­ lywood playboy, died of neglect — a pitiful, emaciated figure whose demise befitted a pauper. 
9o pounds 
When his aides flew him to Houston from 
Acapulco, Mexico, on 
April 5, 1979, it was too late to save him. The man who was dead on arrival at the airport was a withered six-foot- tall, 
9o-pound corpse with a long, unkempt heard and an unhealed wound on his head. 
An autopsy revealed that Hughes, 7o, had suf­ fered from ulcers, cancer, advanced kidney disease, undernourish­ ment, dehydration, and badly decayed teeth. 
In subsequent months, written accounts por­ trayed Hughes’ last 15 years as a nightmare of drug addiction, self-de- privation and obsessions; of races around the globe from one darkened hotel room to another trying to outrun private demons. 
“ Some of the accounts of his behavior really as­ tonished m e,” says 
Jam es Phelan, whose book. “ Howard Hughes: 
The Hidden Years,” un­ 

 existence for the first time through revelations from his servants. 
Intriguing 
“ Here was a man with all the resources in the world,” says Phelan, 
“ and he chooses at enor­ mous expense to live like a Social Security pen­ sioner. I f s the single most intriguing question in his life. Hughes never explained himself lo anybody.’’ 
The first alleged will was delivered m yster­ io u s ly to the Mormon 
Church'headquarters in 
Salt Lake City, Utah. It left the then-estimated 
$2.5 billion to medical research but gave shares to Hughes’ two ex-wives, his aides and a gas sta­ tion owner named Melvin 
Dummar. 
The 3oth “ vviU” left the estate to Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute. 
In between, there were the wills witnessed by 
Ja ck the Ripper and 
Hopalong Cassidy, and one which left everything to 
“ Richard 
Robard 
Hughes,” who claimed he was Hughes’ ille g i­ timate son and commu­ nicated with his father through a transm itter implanted in his skull. 
Wills sold 
A Miami man went into business selling $2 do-it- yourself Howard Hughes wills. 
“ Most of the wills are 

 crank jokes or sloppy at­ tempts to hijack the em­ pire,” says Ardo Seder- berg, chief spokesman for 
Hughes’ 
Summa 
Corp. 

However, the only pur­ ported w ill heading toward a probate trial is the hand-written Mor­ mon will. The bizarre scenes in that drama multiply daily. A trial to determine its validity is scheduled in Las Vegas on July fi. 

Hughes’ cousin, R i­ chard Gano, special ad- minstrator of the Hughes estate, issued a March 15 report on the will search indicating that yet an­ other will existed at one time. 

Memo 

The search reportedly refers to an undated handwritten memoran­ dum from Hughes to his close aide, Howard Eck- erslev, believed to have been written in 1971 or 72. 
In it, Hughes speaks of a 
“ holographic’’ or handw­ ritten will which would protect his aides alter his death. 

Hughes spoke of want-, ing to replace that will* with a new one. But, if necessary, he said he felt it would be adequate. 

“ I am assured,” he wrote, “ it is binding as a band of steel.” 

Meanwhile, an inven­ tory of Hughes’ assets commissioned by rela­ tives showed his wealth was only $199 million, a mere fraction of the $2.5 billion estimate. The figure is sure to be chal­ lenged in court.

BANGKOK. Thailand 
(AP) - “ Call me King 
Leka I.” says the young 
6-foot-8 Albania exile sit­ ting outside his hot cell at a Thai police station and displaying a pistol engraved with the goat’s head emblem of the short-lived 
Albanian monarchy. 
To Thai authorities, he is 
Ti j 
Leka 
Mbret 
Shqptarvet, 38, and he is in a cell because he i charged with possession of a cache of American 
MIB assault rifles, rocket launchers, sticks of dyn­ amite — and seven glis­ tening, high-powered au­ tomatic pistols with gilded name plates and engraved butts. 
Ile is the son of Ahmed 
Zogu, who seized power in Albania in 1925, pro­ claimed himself King 
Zog I in 1928, and fled the country before Italian 
Fascist invaders in 1939. 
After World War II, 
Communist partisans under 
Enver 
Hoxha seized power, and Leka grew up in exile in Ma­ drid. 
Overthrow 
From there, he claims he has begun a guerrilla war to overthrow the 
Communists in Albania. 
The fancy pistols, claims tho exile king, were to be gifts to prominent Thais as "symbols of Albania’s fight for freedom.” 
“ We are sending oper­ ational teams into A l­ bania, on-and-off, in- and-out,” the towering, bespectacled exile said in fluent English. “ I’m the political head of the movement and. if you wish the military com­ mander.” 
But Leka wouldn't say whether the battlefield weaponry he is accused of possessing hasanything to do with the guerrilla operations he claims to lead. 
Police said they found

 the arms. and 2,ooo rounds of ammunition, in a Bangkok hotel room 
Wednesday. They traced the arms to a Thai man, and Thursday seized him and Leka in a raid on a private home. At the home, police said, they found the seven pistols and parts for the arms seized in the hotel. 
Guerrillas 
Leka’s claims of guerrilla teams inside 
Albania couldn't be con­ firmed in Bangkok and there was some scratch­ ing of heads about a 
Thai-Al ban inn connec­ tion. 
Western diplomats say the articulate and affable 
Leka holds an Albanian government in exile pas­ sport which is recognized by a number of countries 
— including Spain, where he and his court live.

But although Leka has visited Thailand on his 
“ official passport” se­ 

 veral times, and his pic­ ture has appeared iii lo­ cal society columns. Thai officials haven’t yet acted on his claim of diploma­ tic immunity. 
Leka said he lives in a five-acre compound outside Madrid with his wife, the daughter of an 
Australian sheep farmer whom he calls Queen 
Susan; his mother Queen 
Geraldine, the widow of 
Zog I and a former Hun­ garian-American coun­ tess, and a court of 1o-15 persons. 

Resistance 
Leka says he was only three days old when King 
Zog fled their M ary­ land-sized Balkan home­ land. but his father, who died in 1961, brought him up to lead the Albanian resistance. He was edu­ cated at Britian's Sand­ hurst Military Academy and at the Sorbonne in 
Paris, he said. 

“ I am lighting to li­ berate my people. Once that’s done they can de­ cide if they want a mon­ archy ar a republic," Le­ ka said. “ I ll continue to 

 fight until we are free or 
I ani dead. We are very stubborn people." 
The exile king said he ordered the first insur­ gent probes about three, years ago and that to date they have been 
“ lowscale.” chiefly for intelligence gathering, to raise people’s morale and “ in very particular eases for sabotage work.” 

He refused to say where his guerrillas are trained. He said he tra­ vels through the world to drum up support for his cause and on business which he says provides funds for the royal coffers. 

Moslem 
A Moslem, Leka said he is involved in heavy equipment and commo­ dities in the Middle East and elsewhere, and that sizable contributions flow in from Albanians abroad, including some 
89,ooo in the United 
‘States. Ile visited New 
York last June to meet with the Albanian coni- niuntiy.

VIRGINIA, Minn. - They buried Tom Kolstad again Sa­ turday. But this time it was at home, in the slowly thawing ground of the family plot in 
Calvary Cemetery. 

And this time his own people were around. 
That seemed to make a difference, somehow easing the long ache of the

Relief 
"It's been a relief," said Kolstad's mother. Cecilia, a white-haired retired nurse, as her family gathered for the service in this grim y M esabi Iron 
Range city of about 12,ooo, some BO miles north of Duluth. 
And then, looking at Ginger Baul, her son’s former wife who remarried about a year and a half ago, a few months after Tom Kolstad had been declared legally dead, she added: 
"I never thought that this day would come, did you?” 
"No, I never did," Mrs. Daul replied as her l l -year-old son. Aaron, fidgeted in the background. “ I never thought we d have this satisfaction.'' 
But it did come, almost half a gen­ eration late, at a time when the Viet­ nam War for m any, perhaps most, 
Americans is subsiding into the mists of history. 
And on Saturday, the Rev. Thomas 
McEnery celebrated a mass of resur­ rection at the Sacred Heart Roman 
Catholic c lire or Kolstad, completing another bit of the unfinished business of that war that every now and then emerges to nag at the nation's forget­ fulness.

 typical of the 3.3 million Americans the Defense Department counted as having served in Indochina between 
Jan. I, 1961, and Jan. 27, 19B3, even of the 46,568 killed in action of or the 
1o,399 who died outside of combat and certainly of the 7,577 missing in action, of whom he was one until his name appeared on the North Vietnamese list. 
He was born in Isabella, a village about 5o miles east of here, on July ll, 
1935, and moved with his family the next year to Parkerville, a tiny com­ munity on the outskirts of Virginia that doesn't even make the maps, where he grew up in a small white frame house with five brothers and a sister. 
Like a lot of Iron Range boys, he loved the outdoors ("All my guys like to hunt and fish.” his mother recalled proudly). 
He went to the old yellow- brick high school in nearby Mountain Iron where he played end on the football team and graduated in 1953. 
After graduating from Virginia Jun­ ior College in 1955, he joined the 
Navy’s flight training program. 

End anxiety 
What separates Tom Kolstad from most of the MIAs of course, is that he is among the handful whose; remains have been recovered, ending the long anxiety of family and friends, years of not really knowing. 
The families of two of those reported found by the North Vietnamese — Col. 
Curtis A. Eaton of Kingston, R I . .and 
Capt. Lawrence H. Goldberg of Duluth, 
Minn., both Air Force officers — were plunged back into that uncertainty when the military’s Central Identifica­ tion Laboratory in Hawaii discovered that they had been misidentified. 
Laboratory officials said the Eaton coffin contained the remains of a Viet­ namese, reducing to ll the number of 
Americans returned, and the man in the coffin identified as G oldberg turned out to be a member of his crew, 
Lt. P a tric k E. W inne of Satellite 
Beach. Flu. 
“ Our family has had one adjustment after another,” said Mrs. Eaton sadly after she had been told by Vice Presi­ dent Walter F. Mondale of the mistake. • 
Even for son) • of those for whom th e . waiting has finally ended, the return of the bodies renewed old pains. 
Mrs. Mayce Metz of Poplar Bluff, 
Mo., for instance, recalled that a me­ morial service had been held for her husband. Col. Jam es ll. Metz, whose 
FIDS fighter was downed over North 
Vietnam in April 1968, after he was declared legally dead in May, 1975. 

Wounds reopened 
When he app eared on the North 
Vietnamese list last September, she said, the old wounds were reopened as they were again when she heard his remains would be shipped home. 
This time she is planning a private 

'Hopefully, this will be the last time f she said. It's just as if you bury someone and you bury him agaih and you bury him again' 

 service for just the family. 
"H opefully, this will be the last tim e,” she said. "It's just as if you bury someone and you bury him again and you bury him again.” 
Among relatives of the ll whose bodies w ere re tu rn e d , only Mrs. 
Lourdes Bowling, a native of Barce­ lona. Spain, who was married to Navy 
Capt. Roy H. Bowling, voiced resent­ ment about the war in Vietnam. 
At her home in Lemoore, Calif., a village 27 miles south of Fresno, the 
47-year-old mother of three said: 
"What can I say about the war? It was terrible. So many children with no fathers today.” 
Here in Virginia, no regrets were expressed about the war or the m e­ morial service that was held for Tom 
Kolstad two years ago. 
For the Kolstads, Saturday’s mili­ tary funeral put a proper public end to a long-time lack. 

Remember 
But Friday, as the family gathered in the cram ped kitchen of the little white house in Parkerville, was a time for private remembering. 
Je rry Kolstad, a year older than 
Tom, who was the second child, recalls how "all six of us boys slept in one room.” 
"Tom and I used to fight about who had to sleep next to the wall,” he added with a smile, "because it was so cold the covers froze right to it." 
And then Jerry fussed about whether there were any old high school annuals around so Tom’s son, Aaron, who was only 5 ^ months old when his father went to Vietnam, could see the pic­ tures. 
"I have one at home,” said Ginger. 
Tom’s former wife, who flew- up from 
Garland, Tex., for the service. 
“ W e’ve been doing a lot of that, looking at pictures, the last few days.” 
After that they got talking about 
Toni’s last visit home. 

Surpise 
‘‘You w ere in C h ic a g o ," T o m 's mother, Cecilia, said to Ginger. 
"Didn’t he surprise you that time?” 
Ginger asked. 
“ Yes, and I’ve got a picture with him from that time,” Mrs. Kolstad added. 
"A nd he sent us o rch id s from 
Hawaii,” Ginger said. 
For a few minutes there in the kit­ chen Friday afternoon, as the two wo­ men sailed across the years at the memory of orchids, it was almost as if 
Tom Kolstad had n *ver gone aw ay to war.

Court 
Judge Tom Cave Satur­ day overruled a defense objection to his time li­ mit for the questioning of prospective jurors in the capital m urder trial of 
Cullen Davis. 

Jury selection is only halfcomplete after more than a month in the trial of the Fort Worth m il­ lionaire. Davis, 43, is ac­ cused in the slayings last 
August of his 12-year-old stepdaughter, A ndrea 
Wilborn, and Stan Farr, 
3o, the boy fried of Davis’ estranged wife Priscilla, 

35. Davis is on trial in the girl’s death,* 
Cave ruled Thursday that lawyers for each side could spend only 9o min­ utes per prospective jur­ or. Defense attorney Ri­ chard Haynes of Houston objected to the lim it, saying a it might cause attorneys to skip over crucial m atters. Asst. 
Dist. Atty. Marvin Col­ lins said the prosecution favored the time limit. 

Collins said, “ If we are ever to try to this case, the process m ust be speeded up somehow.” 
Cave said in his ruling, 
“ Counsel at both tables 

 are extrem ely e x p e r­ ienced and competent at voire dire (questioning of jurors) and are capable of fram ing in telligent questions in considerably less than an hour and a half.” 
The attorn eys q u es­ tioned and rejected their

Master bobs, computer weaves as champ stops match at 42 

The latest concoctions of North Carolina's res- tauranteurs — “ Tied To­ m ato,” 
“ Cracked 
O range,” 
“ Classic 
Coffee.” and “ Cham ­ pagne Shiver” — appar­ ently weren't to the taste of the Board of Alcohol 
Control. 

The board voted Friday to maintain the state's ban on sales of alcoholic beverages by the drink, despite the wine or bee!1 base for each of the new breed of cocktail. 

The board said if custom ers wanted the cocktails they would haw to mix them themselves. 
Wine and beer can be sold by restaurants and lounges. Customers also 

 can bring their own li­ quor and order mixers. 
One restaurant chain which m ade the new cocktails described them as: 
“ Cham pagne 
Shiver.” champagne 

 and sour mix; "Cracked 
Orange,” red wine and orange juice; “ Tied To­ mato.” tomato juice and draft beer; 
“ C lassic 
Coffee.” coffee and ver­ mouth. 
Candidate asks voters to elect someone else 

City Council candidate Dallas Mulgrew, owner of an East Dubuque, III., liquor store and bar, is asking voters to select someone else in the April 19 elections. 
“ Since Illinois law prevents a tavern owner from holding public office, I would have to sell my business or not take office as a councilman.” 
Mulgrew . 4o. said in an advertisement in the East 
Dubuque Register. 
Mulgrew said he had hoped to win election and challenge the law in court. 
“ But since I entered the race for the council. I discovered that the court costs would be really something, so now I'm backing out,” he said. 

David Levy, an international chess master, defeated a computer Friday in a successful effort to prove a point In* m ade in 19o8 — that no com puter would beat him in the following IO years. 
The machine lost in 42 moves made in three and a half hours. 
Bans Berliner, a Carnegie-Mellon 
Lniversity computer scientist and like 
Levy an international master, said that the machine made a serious positional error on the 25th move and that Levy had exploited it. 
"Until then,” Berlinger said, “ the machine was very much in the* game. 
E'er a while I thought the computer had the better of it.” 
Levy, a relaxed, 32-year-olu resident of London, played the computer, which was in Minneapolis, because of a 1.25o pound wager (about $2,1oo) he made years ago again st four, com puter scientists. 
Although Levy won Friday’s match, he has not yet won the bet. which pro­ vides that he will lose if he is defeated by a computer before August 1978. 
In Friday’s competition, a telephone linked the computer to a video ter­ minal in a room in Science Hall at

15o Alsatians due for visit 

'Blood and Money9 wins award 

By JACK FINGER 
Alex Haley’s search for roots was more celebrated but the co­ lony of Medina County Alsatians has its own version of making; connections with European cou­ sins. 
Another chapter in the story will unfold this week as some 15o visitors from the distant Hhineland are treated to a swift, five-day visit of San Antonio and Medina County points of interest. 
The group will arrive at 9:4o p.m. 
Thursday on American Airlines flight 
9733. They will depart at H p.m. Tues­ day, April 12. 
This will be the fourth organized ex­ change of visits between “ Little Al­ sace” of Medina County and “ Big Al­ sace” of Eastern France. 
Alsatians of this area are descen­ dants of the original colony established by Henri Castro at Castroville in the 
184os. Castro’s settlers were recruited from the ranks of the improverished 
Alsatian peasant farmers who strug­ gled for a living along the banks of tile 
Rhine. 
The group coming Thursday will be the most vocal of all. Coming with them will be a prize-winning "oom ­ pah” band. Les Egelbacher from Uff- holtz. The band will play for two dances, one in New Braunfels Saturday night, and a street dance in Castroville 
Easter Sunday night. 
Homes 
Most of the visitors will be put up in 
San Antonio and Castroville private homes. 
Coordinating arrangements are John 
Joseph of Overseas Travel Co., San 
Antonio, and Gilbert Hadey. French cultural atfairs officer. Hadey will ar­ rive Tuesday. 
The Alsatians will leave from Mul- house Wednesday and spend Thursday sightseeing in New York before head­ ing for San Antonio. 
Friday’s tour of San Antonio will in­ clude points of interest such as the 

Alamo, Hemisfair Plaza, McNay Mu­ seum and the Rivcrwalk. Mayor Lila 
Cockrell will welcome them at 1o:3o a.m. in front of the Alamo. 
Saturday the tour heads for the 
Mayan Dude Ranch in Bandera where guests will enjoy a barbecue and re­ ceive a taste of Texas ranch life. 
Shopping 
At 3 p.m. Saturday the tour returns to San Antonio for 2*2 hours of shop­ ping at North Star Mall. 
Later Saturday evening the visitors will enjoy a boat ride on the San An­ tonio River and a Mexican dinner. 
Sunday morning the tour will leave 
San Antonio al 8:31) a . rn. for C a s t r o ­ ville, where an Easter Sunday high 
Mass will be celebrated in St. Louis 
Church at 1o:3o a.rn. 
After a day of visiting in Castroville, the Alsatians and their hosts will at­ tend a street dance. 
On Monday the group will board buses for a trip to Piedras N egras, 
Mexico. T uesday will be a day of leisure before leaving that evening for home. 
Needs 
By Sunday, Joseph was still seeking two or three additional San Antonio homes for guests. Persons who would like to put up the Alsatians for three nights, Thursday through Saturday, must be able to speak French or Alsa­ tian. Interested parties may contact 
Joseph at 828-H444. 

Last Ju n e 225 Texans spent two weeks touring tin* land of A lsace. 
Charles O. Kilpatrick, publisher of the 
San Antonio Express-News. headed the contingent which was honored by 14 official receptions in the various Alsa­ tian communities. 
A highlight of that tour was the re­ ception at Eguisheim. a community which has been officially designated by the French government as C a stro ­ ville^ sister city.

CONSECUTIVE 
DIVIDENDS 

Dividends. An integral part of the Free Enterprise System, and one of the cornerstones of the 
Travis Savings and Loan Association, a staunch supporter of the Free Enterprise System. Without it. 
America wouldn't be what it is . . the Travis wouldn’t be what it is . . . and vow probably wouldn’t 

 be what vou are. 
Dividends come from wise investment . . . one of the .privileges of the Free Enterprise 
System. An investment like an insured savings account at the Travis . . . a sound savings institution that hasn't missed paying a dividend since we were tounded 5o years ago. 
The Travis is as solid and strong as granite . . . as safe and secure as our nation itself .. . and pays the highest annual dividend rates permitted by regulation. 
Free Enterprise. It makes it possible for the Travis to pay its 11 bth consecutive dividend as of 
March 31, 1977. An enviable record of dividends paid . . . when due . . . since 1927. 5o years! 
If vou like America and the American system; if you like being your own man; making your own decisions; determining the course of your own life; support Free Enterprise. It’s what makes 

America tick

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S — Sunday April 3 1977 
Ballot bill up to Senate 

EXPRESS N E W S C A P T IT O l BUREAU 
AUSTIN — "Any law which causes a person to be reluctant to vote is a bad law,” Hep. Ernestine G lossbrenner said 
T u e sd a y in u r g in g 
House members to support her bill to eli­ minate ballot stubs for T exa s elec­ tions. 
The freshman legislator from Alice made her point as the House gave its unanimous approval to her 1IB893 on a voice vote Thursday. 
^ Rep. Glossbrenrter’s bill, which now goes to the Senate, does away with the requirement to sign slubs on paper ballots. 
In debate T u e sd a y , she told the 
House her bill would put an end to machine politics domination, especial­ ly in South Texas where such practices allowed the family of the late George 
Farr to control Duval county for three decades. 
Important notice regarding 
Montgomery Ward advertising section in today’s newspaper. 

Some of the womens merchandise il­ lustrated on page 
3 of our 
4-color 

 rotogravure is not available in the exact colors indicated or illustrated. The styles shown are the same and you are sure to be delighted with the colors we have. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

She said about half the eligible voters in the state, primarily in rural counties most subject to political do­ mination by one group, are required to 
Sign stubs on paper ballots. 
Voters in urban counties with voting machines face no such requirement. 
Prior to Thursday’s voice vote for final passage. HB893 has received a record vote of 111-22 to move it to third reading. 
MEDICINE 
Nearly 33 million in' state funds will be used over the next two years to pay for 15o new family medical training residencies at hospitals in the stale. 
HB282 bv Rep. Lyndon Olson dr. of 
Waco cleared the legislature last Mon­ day and was sent to the governor. 
The House agreed 126-6 to accept two minor amendments placed on the bill in the Senate. 

Hearing set on allowables 

AUSTIN 
(AP) - 
The 
T exa s 
R ailro ad 
Commission will hold a hearing April 4 on m o­ tions for reh earin g, recon sid erin g and amending its recent in­ terpretative order on gas m ark et dem and d e te r ­ m ination allocation of gas well allow ables. 
The com m ission said the order issued Feb. 17 w as designed to allow more accurate proration of Texas gas production to market demand and is expected to reduce take- or-pay requirem ents of field purchasers of gas. 

Aimed at helping alleviate a growing shortage of general medicine practi­ tioners in Texas, HB282 allows Texas colleges and universities to contract with medical schools, licensed hopitals and non-profit organizations for the expanded program. 
The bill carried the endorsement of 
Bexar County Hospital District and the 
University of T exas Health Science 
Center at San Antonio. 
HB282 provides funding for doctors who wish to do their post-graduate re­ sidency in the field of family, or gen­ eral practice, medicine. 
ORDINANCES 
“ T h is bill, this bill that allow s county ordinance making powers ... I ask you if this bill would allow county c o m m issio n e rs co u rts to p a ss gun control law s?” 
"God forbid,” said Rep. Phil Cates of Shamrock, sponsor of HBI79. 
"I didn’t ask you what God was go­ ing to do, I asked you if this bill would allow county commissioners courts to pass gun control laws.” 
The questioner was Rep. John Wil­ son of LaGrange. The scene was the 
House floor Monday. The subject was 
HB179 g ra n tin g lim ited ord in an ce m ak in g pow ers to c o m m issio n e r s courts. 
Wilson’s questioning set the stage for an all-out attack when the bill cam e 

 u d f o r debate on Monday. 
By Thursday, when it was passed 
88-42, the question of gun control and just about every other ordinance power for commissioners had been answered by amendments tacked on by oppon­ ents. 
The am endm en ts gutted the bill, su p p o rters said , and in dicated the 
Senate would now have to clean it up. 
Cates, while not happy with the out­ come, said despite the am endm ents 

"the principle of the bill remains in­ tact.” 
Gone from the bill is the power of com m issioner to control zoning and land use development within counties. 
The bill also lost its provision allow­ ing voters to gran t c o m m issio n e rs blanket ordinance making power sub­ ject lo recall election for those ordin­ ances they don't like. 
In its place is an amendment calling for every proposed ordinance to be submitted to the voters. 
HOSPITALS 
Financially slimmed down from $51 million to $1o million, a bill prov iding state aid to teaching hospitals finally cleared the Senate on Tuesday, 22-7, and was sent to the House. 
SB6I) by Sen. Chet Brooks of P a sa ­ dena proposes first-time state funding of purely education related costs at six teaching hospitals in Texas. 
Included are the Bexar County and 
Robert B. Green Hospitals under one appropriation to Bexar County Hospi­ tal District. 
Despite the financial parring down. 
Brooks called the bill " a start in the right direction” and Sen. John Traeger of Seguin voiced relief it was finally out of the Senate. 
“ We fin ally got the votes in ,” 
Traeger said. "W e’ve been trying for a long time to set this predendent.” 

The House version of SBBfl, by Rep. 
Mickey Leland of Houston, is identical to the Brooks measure. 

H ow ever, it’ s un derstood H ouse 
Speaker Bill Clayton has ideas of his, own about the program. 

While Clayton supports the idea in principle, it is believed he’d rather see the money go directly to the student doctors in some sort of scholarships.

Statu s of le g isla tio n 

EXPRESS-NEW S CAPITOL BUREAU 
AUSTIN — As of Sunday here was the status of important issues of local interest pending before the 
65th Legislature 6o days before adjournment: 
Gas reservoirs 
— Senate Natural Resources 
Committee takes up a bill Wednesday which could go a long way towards solving shortfalls in San 
Antonio’s natural gas supplies. 
Senate Bill 8o1, sponsored by Sen. John Traeger of 
Seguin, proposes to give gas companies property condemnation powers to acquire underground gas storage reservoirs. 
This is something San Antonio and its gas sup­ plier, Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., have long sought—a tool assuring completion of reservoir projects for backup gas supplies during peak demand periods. 
From most indications, T raeger’s bill should not run into too many problems in committee. 

CPS appointments 
— House Intergovernmental 
Affairs Committee is expected to pass to the House a bill granting San Antonio City Council the authority to appoint m em bers of City Public Service Board members. 

This is the bill Rep. Joe Hernandez says is his second attempt to bring C PS decision m aking process "back to the people.” Three weeks ago the bill was incorrectly voted out of committee because of a vote mix-up. 

CPS attorneys have strenously argued that a change in selection method of CPS board would adversely affect the utility’s bond rating. But a recent attorney general’s opinion says there doesn’t appear to be anything unconstitutional about the 
Hernandez bill. The measure should reach the House floor soon after it is assigned by the calendar committee. 

Pari-mutuel wagering 
— J u s t now entering the starting gates, the Texas Horse Racing Act is due for a public hearing April 12 before the House Intergo­ vernmental Affairs Committee. Despite reports the legalization of horse race betting has increased chances this time, committee chairman Rep. Gib 
Lewis of Fort Worth says the bill has only a 5o-5o chance of survival in committee. Look for another big clash between church groups and horse race fans. 

Bingo legalization — Bingo is another issue which pits anti-gambling church forces against a lot of 
South Texans who enjoy the gam e played for charity fund raising purposes. Since Sen. Frank Lombar- dino’s bingo legalization resolution passed its two-thirds test in the Senate, it has idled in House 
Constitutional Amendments Committee. A public hearing on the bill is tentatively set for April 13. 

Committee chairman Rep. Tim Von Dohlen of 
Goliad says he sympathizes with the pro-bingo side. 

Utility tax exemption — A controversial m easure sponsored by Rep. Don Cartwright has been a s ­ signed to the House general state calendar. 

The Cartwright bill HBI 16o proposes to exempt 12 
Bexar County school districts and the Bexar County 
Hospital District from the city’s 11.5 per cent "in lieu of tax” charged added to the districts’ utility bills. The m easure would include in the exemption several towns outside of Bexar County w hich pay the add-on charge because they are served by City 
Public Service. 

Cartwright’s bill received a hearty send-off from the Energy Resources Committee, which viewed it as a means for saving some consumers from heavy utility costs. Next step is for Cartwright’s bill to move to the House floor.

N E W Y O R K TIMES SERVICE 
WASHINGTON - Of all the gray, faceless bureaucracies in W a­ shington. The Veterans 
Administration has a reputation as perhaps the grayest and most face­ less of them all. 
The huge agency, which employes 228,ooo civil servants and has a budget of SIH billion, is said to be unresponsive to the needs of 29 million veterans, cumbersome and inefficient, and staffed with indifferent time-servers. 
“ The problems here,” says Max (Leland, the new head of the agency, 
“ are every bit as bad as I thought they would be — and maybe a little worse." 
Vigorous 
(’Ie la nd. a former 
Georgia state legislator and staff member of the 
Senate Committee on Ve­ terans Affairs, has start­ ed what appears to be one of the more vigorous reorganizations in the 
Carter administration. 
“ I want to renew a sense of purpose, a sense of mission and a sense of dedication to the job that this agency has set out 
. for it.” he says. 
Beyond revitalizing a stagnant agency. Cleland faces several challenges from the veterans of the war iii Vietnam. They include the following: 
• The charge that the nation and the Veterans 
Administration have ig­ nored the Vietnam veter­ an because he fought in an unpopular war and returned to a suspicious homeland. Moreover, say some Vietnam veterans, the nation’s veterans’ or­ ganizations with political power arc more interested in the prob­ lems of veterans from 
World War II and Korea. 
• The allegation that the (ii Bill of Hights,j which provides educa-j tional benefits to veter­ ans, is inadequate for the 
Vietnam veteran. Critics also say the bill favors veterans from the South and West over those from the Northeast and Middle 
West. In addition, the system has been cor­ rupted by schools and 
\eterans who take money illegally. 
• The accusation that the V.A. provides insuf­ ficient psychological counseling and rehabili­ tation services for the 
Vietnam veterans. Cri­ tics contend the soldier who served in Vietnam faces severe trials in re­ turning to civilian life, many of them an out­ growth of the distaste for the war. 
Cleland has started off on his appointed task of reinvigorating the Veter­ ans Adminsistration with a six-week study to iden­ tify specific problems. A transition group will make recommendations for reorganization within a few weeks. 
Recruit 
He has also begun to recruit managers from outside the agency to staff 2o to 25 senior posi­ tions. 
Cleland says he is try­ ing to lead by example. 
He has made two trips out of Washington in his first month, has three scheduled for this month, and four for May. 
“ I want to stay in touch with what’s going on in the V.A. system,” he says. 
In the longer range, 

H ie problems here are every bit as bad as I thought they would be 
— and maybe a little worse ’ 

Cleland is pushing for the installation of a $1oo mil­ lion computer to keep records and make benefit payments. “ It will do in 
12 seconds what takes two weeks now by man­ ual search.” 
The budget changes 
Cleland wants to make for the fiscal year begin­ ning next October are 
.just starting to take shape. He has suggested no big increases or de­ creases. but a realloca­ tion of resources, such as expanded medical care and alcoholic rehabilita­ tion. 

The new administrator will also be able to in­ fluence the fundamental course of the agency at the regional level over the next two to four years as 6o per cent of the re­ gional directors retire. 
Youngest 
Cleland, who at 34 is the V.A.’s youngest ad­ ministrator, indicates he wants to be even-banded in the agency’s treatment of Vietnam and older ve­ terans. He himself lost both legs and his right arm in the Vietnam War. 
Even so, he recently 

 told a Senate committee that senior veterans must have a fair pension plan and better medical care. 
The number of veterans over 65 w ill triple to eight million in the next 13 years. 
Cleland defends the current GI Bill as ade­ quate since 1974, when a loan provision was ad­ ded. He maintains the bill is for education, not for supplementary in­ come. The loan provision also helps overcome the advantage veterans who live in the Sunbelt states enjoy because their states have built less costly community colleges; veterans else­ where can use the loan provision to help pay for higher fees. 
The new administrator 

 says the overpayment of educational benefits, the! biggest single violation of regulations, has been cut from $8oo million to $4 million last year, with the agency recovering about 75 per cent of that. 

He says the new com­ puter will reduce that when it is installed in three years, but until then ‘‘we are in a da­ mage control operation.” 

Rehabilitation 

Cleland says the agency should emphasize rehabilitation, expand# counseling services for a limited period, and add more rehabilitation of drug users and alcoho­ lics.

Liddy hopes for pardon 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ALLENWOOD, Pa. - G. Gordon Liddy, the only Watergate burglar still in jail, types up the daily menus as a kitchen clerk while he waits, hopefully, for President 
Carter to reduce his sentence. 
Liddy, 46. a fo rm er 
FBI agent who served as a lawyer for President 
Richard 
M. 
Nixon's 
White House and re-elee- tion staff, is serving 6 to 
2o years at the federal prison farm here for burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping. 
Without presid en tial intervention. 
George 
Gordon Liddy won’t be eligible for parole until mid-1981. His request for c o m m utation last Sep­ tember is now under re­ view by the .Justice De­ partment. 
At this m inim um se­ curity facility, which is not nearly as harsh as penitentiary life, Liddy has been assigned to the food service division which feeds the 5oo prisoners. 
He works five days a week in an 8-by-1o-foot office that faces the kit­ c h e n ’s deep fry and steam pots. While paus­ ing from typing or filing he can watch salads be­ ing made, chickens being q u a rte re d , v eg etab les being washed. 

Meanwhile, he's a ja il clerk

G. GORDON LIDDY still jailed 

No complaints 

“ He does his job,” said a prison source, adding there have been no com­ plaints. 
Liddy, who has a schoolteacher wife and five teen-age children in s u b u rb a n W ashington, came to Allenwood from the Federal Correctional 
Institution in Danbury, 
Conn., last .January. 
He has been i m p ­ risoned nearly th ree years, including 
18 months for contempt of court for declining to testify before a g rand jury about the .June 1972 break-in at the Democra­ tic National Committee h e a d q u a r te rs in 
W a­ 

 shington. 
He refuses to see r e ­ porters. or tell why he organized the burglary, and what he expected to find. 
“ Liddy wants absolu­ tely no contact with the press and he is very ada­ mant about it,” said Al­ lenwood Supt. 
Eldon 
Jenson. 
“ Even w hen visitors go through, such as school groups, he h a s asked that he be told in advance so he can be somewhen1 cise. 
“ Under the law I am obligated to protect 
Liddy’s privacy, and that's being done." 
However, form er in­ mates and other sources inside the central Penn­ sylvania c a m p near 
Lewisburg deeribe Liddy as “ quiet . . . tough . . . a 
Fascist-type . . . close­ mouthed." 
“ He can be very friendly if he likes you, and I find him a nice g uy.” said one inmate 

 who knew Liddy at Dan­ bury. 
After Liddy arrived at this 4.ooo-acre c am p , sometimes described as a country club prison where tennis is one of the sports, he becam e a 

 center of controversy and disturbance in the dor­ mitory w here he lived. 
Because of overcrowd­ ed conditions, Liddy was assigned to a hallway bcd about 15 feet from the television room. He com­ plained the noise upset his sleep. 
“This problem had ex­ isted for nearly four months, from many other sim ila r beefs, and we decided to turn off the TV’ set a fte r 11:3o p . m . . ” 
•Jenson said. “ Our timing was bad.” 
Unfortunately, some inmates linked the ban to 
Liddy’s w ritten gripe. 
They considered it spe­ cial treatment for a fa­ mous prisoner and set fire to Liddy’s mattress. 
A second m attress was soaked with water and some of his personal be­ longings were dumped outside. 
“Gordon's legal papers were m issin g for a time,” said his New York lawyer. Peter Maroulis. 
“ Then they reappeared, no questions asked, and 

 that ended that p ro b ­ lem.” 
Liddy. who still wears a thick black moustache which dates to the days when he was an assistant prosecutor in New York state, now lives in the main dorm with 54 other men. Each has a cubicle, 
7 feet wide and 9 feet long. It contains a cot, a couple of lockers and a makeshift desk. 
Library 
His quarters are about 
5o yards from the law li­ b rary where 
Liddy spends a lot of his spare tim e. He also likes to run. 
“ One of the biggest self-imposed program s here is exercise,” Jensen said. “ There has been tons of weight lost run­ ning.” 
At Danbury. Liddy was a real jailhouse lawyer. 
He was in court several times fighting for inmate rights and mail p r iv i­ leges. At Allenwood he hasn't yet filed any legal action.

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS -—Sunday Aprii 3 1977 
Rise in workm en’s comp benefits seen 

 between the actual wage increase and 
SIO. Add it to the increase for the fol­ lowing year in determining the work­ men's compensation benefits that will take effect this September? Or ignore it and start over? 
Mill said the carry over should be stacked onto this year's average wage increase in determinig the new benefit ceiling. 
“The opposite interpretation would allow' consecutive yearly increases in average w ages of $9 w ithout an in ­ crease in com pensation ra tes,” and this wasn’t the legislature’s intent, Hill said. 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AUSTIN — A new legal opin­ ion by Atty. Gen. John Hill is expected to accelerate the rise in both workmen's com pensa­ tion benefits and rates for the job injury insurance carried by employers. 
H ill’s opinion to the Industrial Ac­ cident Board m eans m axim um ben­ efits for injured workers probably will rise by at least $14 a w eek in S ep ­ tember. 
The 1973 Texas Workmen’s Compen­ sation Act guarantees a $7 increase in the maximum benefit for each $1o rise in the average weekly wage for m an­ ufacturing production w orkers. The minimum benefit rises by $1 for each 
$1o increase in the average wage. 
Benefits rose 
Last year, the average weekly wage increased by just under $2o. As a re­ sult, the m axim um w orkm en’s com ­ pensation benefit jumped from $7o to 
$77. Had the wage increase made it to 
$2o, the new m axim um would have been $84. 
The IAE asked Hill what to do with the difference — or “ carry over” -—

$19 increase 
IAB member Sid McKinney said the average wage in m anufacturing has increased by about $19. When added to the $9 carry over, that would guarantee an increase of $14 — and perhaps as much as $21 if the rise in the average wage goes much higher. 
M cK inney said som e in su r a n c e companies had argued that the legis­ lature intended for the carry over to be dropped and not added onto su b ­ sequent wage increases in computing benefits.

W oman, 67 alerts 3 but dies in fire 
By CECIL C LIFT 
An eld erly w om an died Saturday night after alerting sleep in g relatives to leave her burning 
North Side home. 
A fire fighter received facial burns when he at tempted to rescue the woman. 
Dead is Alma Queen, 87, of 324 Dora St. 
Fire Fighter Steven Acquart, 27, was undergoing treatm ent al Bexar County Hospital following the blaze. 
Reported 
The fire was reported to authorities by the vic­ tim ’s sister-in-law, Elsie Osborne, 52, of Odem. Mrs. 
Osborne, her husband and their two sm all grand­ children were visiting Mrs. Queen at the time. 
Mrs. Osborne said she und the two children were asleep in the rear bedroom w hen Mrs. Queen ran in shouting that the kitchen was on fire. Mrs. Os­ borne’s husband was not al the residence at Un­ tune. 
Mrs. Osborne managed to scoot the children out the front door and then telep h on ed the fire department. 
“ Alma went into the bedroom. I kept yelling for her to get out. There was a lot of smoke and flames. 
Finally I had to get out,” Mrs, Osborne said. 
The woman said Mrs. Queen said she had to get something. “ I think she was trying to get some money in the bedroom.“ she said. 
Blown back 
Firemen arrived at the flaming residence shortly after being called at 8:51 p.m. Hist. Chief Wes Suw- chak said. Fireman Acquart entered through a rear window and was blown back by a ball of flames. 
The fireman was transported to the hospital after being treated at the scene by EMS technicians. 
Chief Sawchak said Mrs. Queen s body was found slum ped in the corner of the bedroom . She was burned only on the arm s and appeared to have died of sm oke inhalation, he said. 
The lire was reported under control at 9:o7 p.m. 
Arson investigators late Saturday were probing the cause of the blaze. 
Total dam ages were estim ated at $15,ooo, Sawchak said.

Board okays standards for schools 

AUSTIN (A P) - The State Board of Educa­ tion approved statewide school accreditation stan­ dards Saturday that include minimum teaeher-pupil ratios and an insistence upon good discipline. 
Under a 1975 law, accreditation w ill becom e a requirement for receiving state school aid starting in September. 
Accreditation has been voluntary until now, but most major districts seek it because it enhances the ability of their graduates to gain admission to col­ leges and universities. 
Schools will be reviewed for accreditation every five years, with a fifth of the state’s districts coming up for inspection each year. 
Standards are gen erally w orded, but the pre­ scribed indicators of whether the standards are met become fairly specific. 
Must be organized 
One standard says a district must be “ organized iii a way that advances better teaching." 
An indicator is that the ratio of students to cer­ tified teachers, distrietw ide, does not exceed 25 pupils per teacher. If abnormally large classes are taught, a district must have good reasons. 
Another indicator is that a “ district is m aking strong efforts to protect good teaching from the negative effects of disruptive behavior of students or outsiders.” 
School buildings must be adequate, and “ seriously deficient status of one or more buildings brings into question compliance with this standard.” especially where there is evidence of “ illegal discrim ination or of indifference toward corrections.’’ 
The standards say teachers must show respect for the dignity of individual students, and an indicator is an official policy defining “ a style of humane treat­ ment" that teachers must apply. 
Inspectors would look for safeguards “ to prevent discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex or handicapping condition.” 
The policy on learning objectives requires a dis­ trict lo pay dose attention to whether “ all students are making satisfactory progress toward com pe­ tence in . . . m athem atics and E nglish language usage.”

Coronation of the Queen has been a high point o f Fiesta W eek since 
19o9. That was the year the Order of the Alamo, a patriotic organiza­ tion of loyal Texans, was founded and accepted the responsibility of choosing and crowning a Queen to rule over the glittering court. This year's theme is The Court of the

Child care 
'authorities’ in question 

NEW YORK — Parents, when they’re in trouble with their children, turn this way and that for advice — to friends, relatives, doctors, psychologists. 
Should 
I spank or shouldn’t I? They might ask, and of course, the answer will depend a lot on who’s giving it. 
But the parents might well act upon it — too readily, perhaps. T hat’s what scares Dr. Rhoda 
Fisher, a child psycholo­ gist. With her husband, 
Dr. Seym our F ish e r, professor of psychiatry at the 
U pstate 
M edical 
Center of the State Uni­ versity of New York, she w rote a book called 
“ What We Really Know 
About Child R e a r in g ’’ 
(Basic Books, $12.5o). 
It’s subtitled, “ Science in Support of Effective 
Parenting.” 
“ If som ebody said, 
‘I’m an expert on flying to the moon, and what you have to do is jump off a building and flap your a rm s ’, you wouldn’t do it,’’ Rhoda Fisher said the other day in an inter­ view. 
But she said that some of the advice offered to parents — and presuma­ bly accepted by at least a few — is ju st as u n ­ founded. 
(She noted how one authority tells m others never to wake their chil­ dren up themselves, but only with alarm clocks. 
“ Now where did he learn that?” she asked. “ From his mother?” ) 
The F ish e rs begai their project by buying book after book by well­ known authorities from 
Benjamin Spook to Good 
H ousekeeping, looking for in form ation that was verifiable by the re­ search done in recen t years. 
They came away from the books c e rta in that there was far too much in the way of “ opinion” and

 notes or extensive biblio­ graphies. 
As a re s u lt, Rhoda 
Fisher urges parents to tak e a position of in ­ formed skepticism in which one goes beyond a statem ent about w hat’s best for children to find out what the statement is based on whenever pos­ sible. When t h a t ’s not possible, parents ought to move cautiou sly , she said. 
Sex education 
Some of the advice she quarrels with, based on her read in g of the r e ­ search lite ra tu re , in ­ volves sex education and breast feeding. 
“ If the sex educators are saying that a formal sex education will significantly help people in their sexual develop­ ment, there’s no evidence to support t h a t ,’’ Dr. 
Fisher said. 
“ But there is evidence that someone who learns to relate w arm ly to somebody else such as the parents will do well sexually, and that c o rre la tes b e tte r than any sex education in the world.” 
And on breast feeding, she said, “ People say that breast feeding is psychologically superior to bottle feeding, but there’s no evidence that supports that either, no evidence that says a child who is bottle fed"will turn out to be less secure.” 
She is also firm about the kind of parent-child relationships that seem to lead to neurotic chil­ dren. The “ primary fac- 
“ fantasies” on the part of>, to r ,” she said, is the the experts and far too communication in the fa- little in the way of docU' m ented info rm ation . 
They becam e leery of any th in g w ithout foot- 

 mily. 
Parents and children who talk and never make their point are in trouble.

PEG BOARD COMBINES LEARNING AND GAME TIME 
...little muscles stretch to reach right hole 

Growing pains are wonderful! 

From a humble birth, accom ­ panied by labor pains of d e­ sp era tio n , the M ission Road 
Foundation began in 1946 as a three student school. 

Founded by Mr. and Mrs. Clifford 
Bledsoe after a fruitless search for a school for their mentally retarded son, it has grow n into a sprawling, accre­ dited facility with a 12o resident capa­ city. 
Latest in its growing phases came in 
February 1976 when First Presbyter­ ian Church took over sponsorship of the resident school. Robert C. Murray is executive director under the 23 vo­ lunteer m em ber board of directors, with the majority coming from First 
Presbyterian Church. 
The nursery and six dorms are being renovated. Other facilities include four classrooms, physical, occupational and speech therapy rooms, gym , indoor swimming pool, clinic with isolation room, recreation room, laundry, kit­ chen. dining room and administration offices. 
Facilities 

“ We have dreams of an even better future,” Murray says, “ Ideally we’d like to go to a cottage concept and expand to house 16o. Home atmosphere is in itself therapeutic. 
“ Expanding vocational training fa­ cilities and securing sheltered work­ shops would give more opportunities to help. 
“ Most of our live-in young people can be trained to do something — but, of course, not all of them.” 
Like most dreams, it has a price tag. 
Until resources are available. Mission 
Road Foundation is busy with what they have. 
Last August, big changes were made. 
Custodial care no longer was the main emphasis. The three-therapies took over as priorities in the rehabilitation department — occupational, physical and recreational. 
Each individual needs a personalized therapy prescription. 
Physical and emotional needs must be considered. 
Some need gross and fine motor skills. 
Many need socialization skills. 

Therapy 
Physical therapy is any treatment by physical means to further development of motor function and to alleviate pain and correct deformity. Its main role is to improve the overall functioning of the individual. 

Department heads are: Rose Marie 
Rine, physical: Connie C arrasco .

HAASE 

 occupational; and Stephanie Skeeler, 
♦recreational therapy. 
Approximately 17 per cent of the residents are at a developmental level below one year of age. One nine year old, for example has a mental levef of a seven month old. 
Retardation 
Many people confuse mental retar­ dation with insanity. They shy away from the retarded thinking they are dangerous or vicious. In truth, accord­ ing to the therapist, most are very . affectionate and like any infant “ crave attention.” 
Their development was normal up to a certain cut-off time, when illness, accident or birth defect brought a halt to their mental development. They can be emotionally hurt or perhaps even violent if rejected or frustrated. 
Since the passage of the law making it mandatory to provide education ser­ vice for ALL children from three to 21 years, the public is having to face up to the fact that present facilities are not adequate. Many handicapped children need almost one-to-one teaching. 
Some of Mission Road Foundation residents benfit enough from therapy so that they can be mainstreamed into their home school district’s special education urograms. 
Harlandale School District and the school have a growing relationship. 
The district has furnished classes and some students attend special education classes. The school houses the dis­ tric t’s program for deaf and blind students until they have their own. 
Some of the residents gain social skills by taking advantage of the City’s 
Parks and Recreation Department's program from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. week­ days at Woodlawn Center. 
When early care for retarded is put off or neglected, these children have less chance of progressing. A 15 year old has 15 years of habits to change. 
Progress in each case is different. A child’s smile can bring tears of joy to a therapist. Something as sim ple as blowing is a milestone. Mastered self- help skills bring happiness. 
Of course, it’s gratifying to have a former resident as a high school gra­ duate and knowing she has held a job for two years. 
One 13 year oid boy with cerebral palsy has been there two years. His legs are withered In six months he has progressed from being totally wheel­ chair bound to am bulatory with a walker. 

JENIFER FINCH IS READY FOR ‘TIRE’ THERAPY 
...Stefanie Skelter gives her encouragement 

He needed help in daily living, now he dresses himself with standby assis­ tance. He has mild mental retardation and is capable of progressing to a home stage with public special education. . 
Without training he probably would have remained in a wheelchair. 

He was a loner, but now works and plays well with others. His self-image improved as his boundaries grew. 
All residents at Mission Road Foun­ dation are mentally retarded with a wide spectrum of degrees. Many have m u lti-d isab ilitites. R esidents may have cerebral palsy, Down’s syndrome, hearing or sight problems. Only those who can benefit are accepted and a 9o

The director, M urray, says, 
“What we’re working on here is really ‘abilitation’ not ‘rehabili­ tation.’ These children are work­ ing to gain abilities they’ve never had.” 
The children at Mission

Checking 

 a beauty 

 wish list 

Despite the fact that the cosm etic industry spends millions on chemical re ­ search and laboratory test­ ing, and new beauty pro­ ducts keep proliferating every month, there are still basic cosmetic ideas whose time has not yet come. 
I can only hope to see some of the following items on my Christmas list in 1977: 

I. 
A hypo-allergenic liquid lip applied with a brush, that will dry to a brilliant, indelible shine. 

FLEUR TAMON 

Our present cream glossers al­ low lipstick to “ bleed” into the corners of the mouth and over the edges of the lip-line. They also leave a sm eary “ glop” on coffee cu p s, g l a s s e s , c ig a r e t t e s , and other people’s faces unless the lips are blotted — which, of course, remov es the gloss. 

2. 
A “ dewey” finish cream or liquid face foundation that does not result in a residue of oil shin­ ing in the areas around the nose, chin, and between the eyebrows. 

The p re se n t a lte r n a tiv e is a 
“ matte finish” makeup that looks like a mask m d is drying and ag­ ing to mature skin. 

We need a m o istu re m akeu p with a soft, lum inous look that doesn t turn us into “ greaseballs" and have us constantly blotting our faces with sponges, tissues, or powder puffs. 

Thin Line 

3. 
An honest-to-goodness, self- sharpening eyebrow pencil that etches a fine, thin line without the lead falling out of the pencil or the points breaking off. 

4. 
A false-eyelash adhesive that peels off in one clean strip so we can stop picking and tearing the lashes, or using chemical solvents to clean off the “ goop.” 

5 A neck makeup to match the face foundation that will positively not result in “ ring around the collar.” 

No matter how closely we try to match our face foundation to our natural skin color, it still usually has enough tint to leave a tell-tale outline around the chin and a pale, naked neck. 

6. Soft, smoky, muted eye sha­ 

 dow colors, either in powder or cream, that do not collect streaks in the folds of the eyelids or give the lids the consistency of lizard skin. 

7. 
Non “ fade-out” frosted, bold lipstick colors that don't 'get “ ea­ ten off” with our lunch and need constant reapplication. Ghostly lips are only great if you’re under 
IB. 

In other words. I’m willing to expend the time to put on a totally fresh face once a day, with only a minor touch-ups for evening, but I don’t want to look disheveled two hours after leaving home.

YSL wins new raves 

I— By--------------------------------------------- 
By NINA HYDE 

 w a s h i n g t o n p o s t n e w s s e r v ic e 

PARIS — Yves Saint Laurent proved two things with his standout collection of ready-to-wear for fall. 
When he bounded out on stage and waved to the cheering audience of buyers and the press, he put down the rumors, finally, that he was sick or had died. 
He was trim m er than six months ago. and conservatively dressed in a suit and tie. 
And the 18o-plus piece collection showed that he has endless ideas for refreshing fam iliar clothes as well as suggesting new ones. 
Saint Laurent’s strength, perhaps his genius. is to design clothes that are suitable for the way his custom ers live and to make them so attrac­ tive they’re hard to pass up. Partly i f s a sense of timing, but he also has the eye to refine the prevailing trends with fabric and proportion better than almost everyone else, and to inter­ ject a few new ideas along the way. 
So what are the Saint Laurent customers go­ ing to wear next fall? And what will numerous other designers copy to prov ide the YSL look at cheaper prices? 
• The Victorian-nightgown look, with ruffed neckline and a ruffle to outline the yoke at the top of the blouse, dress or even coat. 
• The tired skirt, carried forth from earlier collections in printed wool challis for day — other fabrics including a bantamweight lame mousseline for evening. 
• Pants of all lengths including a ribbed-knit style, shaped like seat pan ts, with cuffs or tucked into boots — and p aired with big sweaters or blouson tops. 
• 
Black for evening as with a black velvet suit with Pierrot blouse — to black and gold chiffon in many patterns 
• 
Fringe used lo soften the edges of coats, blouses and dresses — and also trimming boots and bags and shawls. 
F o r tile first tim e in three seaso n s. Saint 
Laurent chose to send his m odels down the runway without fanfare of opera music or with­ out five models striding forth at one time to m ake a forceful statement. The presentation was far more conservative and so were the clothes. 
Most of Saint Laurent's hemlines drop way below the knee.

 ceeds normally. 
When we ask a question, for example, our head hits at the end of the sentence, or we may raise our hand or the pitch of our voice. 
If we want to signal that we intend to keep on talking, we keep our head, hand. or voice level. 
When we answer a question, we lower our head at the end of the answer. If we forget these signals. or deliberately don't use them, or don't know how to use them, the conversation is often awkward. 
Flirting 
I know that body language is different in different cultures, but it seems to me that there must be some signals that cut across every land. 
When I w as in France recently I was able to pick up people my own age by using the same flirting technique I had learned in the states: A sideways glance and a smile. Why did this work so well? 
First of all, while some signals are different, many are the same from culture to culture. We bor­ row body language from other cultures just as we borrow words. 
The movies are the greatest source of cross-cultural body lan­ guage borrowing. 
Second, your flirting signal worked in France because it is a part of French body language. 
The gesture you used is one compounded of eye and eyebrow movements combined with a smile. In doing it, the eyebrows are jerked upward for about one- sixth of a second — so small a time that its impact is subliminal 
— and the glance is given from the corner of the eye. 
It’s a simple greeting, a look that in essence says “ hello” and then slides away before it can be answered. 
Kissing 

I spent an entire evening last week sitting in the living room with my boyfriend and kissing — just that, kissing: 
We both enjoyed it so much that afterward I began to wonder why do people enjoy kissing so? 
„ Kissing is body language, of course, and it says a variety of things. There is the very perfunc­ tory kiss where the lips hardly connect and the message is just as vague. It’s a ritualized gesture. 
At the other end of the scale is the deep, erotic kissing you and your boyfriend enjoyed. 
In between are all the ranges of kissing — from the mother who kisses her child, to the friends who kiss when they meet, the good-bye kiss and the hello kiss, the greeting kiss in France and other foreign countries.

 talked to each other and smiled at each other less. Children just seemed to get in the way of any kind of communication. 
Signals 
I’ve been dating a girl for three weeks, and I feel I'm getting ambivalent signals from her. Are there any body language signals that will tell me how she really feels? 
There are, of course, all the obvious body language signals. 
Does she look toward you often if you’re separated at a party? 
Does she seem relaxed w hen she’s alone w ith you — or does her body posture become stiff and uncomfortable? Does she touch you. hold your hand, want to be close to you physically? 
As a rule, you won’t choose a girlfriend unless your subcons­ cious has already added up all the body language signals and made a decision. We call that decision attraction or chemistry or inter­ est. 
Turned On 
I was at a friend’s house re­ cently when I met this really far-out girl. 
I could tell she was turned on to me because she moved closer to me on the couch, but her date was sitting on her other side. 
Was there any way I could have let her know I liked her without annoying her date? He’s a football player! 

(This is the first of a se­ ven-part series excerpted from the hook " The Body 
Language o f Sex, Pow er and Aggression; How to 
Recognize It and How to 
Use it ," by Ju liu s Fast. 
Published by M. JE vans and 
Co., Inc., copyright (c) 1977 by Julius Fast.) 

Six years ago, Julius Fast wrote 
"Body Language." which became a runaway best seller. Amen to that, he thought... 

He quickly found he had raised more questions than he had ans­ wered. "The pattern of question­ ing, ran in three directions, he says. " People were curious about sex. power and aggression. " 

So he has written another book 

— this time entirely in question and answer format. The first three segments encompass the body lan­ guage o f sex, the next two take over the telltale signs o f power, arid the last two — aggression.

D o e s h e r b o d y sa y s h e ’ s turned off? 
I ’ve heard the term “ gender signal” used. What are gender signals? 
Gender signals are masculine and feminine body movements. 
As an example, most American men cross their legs with their knees open. 
When a woman walks, her pel­ vis tips forward and up. her arms are held close to her body, and they usually swing from the el­ bows down. When men walk, they keep their thighs apart, roll their pelvis back, and sw ing their arms from the* shoulders. 
The way we hold our hands at the w rist is related to gender. The limp wristed gesture is feminine at least in the United States. 

What arc some courting gender signals? 
Often courting signals are un­ conscious. But the most obvious gesture for a woman is the lifted hand that pushes back the hair from the face. 
The equivalent in the man is the unconscious adjustment of the tie, or straightening the creases in the pants. 
Touching the lips with the tongue is often a courting gesture for women, and their eyes come into play fairly often with long looks and side glances. 
Communicate 
My wife always talks me into taking the kids along when we go for a walk. I feel that they cramp our style, but she claims they help us communicate. Can children affect body language ? 
They can, but not in the way your wife thinks. 
A team of seven researchers at the University of Minnesota went out during the summer of 1972 and observed 449 couples with and without children al shopping malls, at the zoo and at the beach. 
They watched to see w hether each person in the group w as touching, smiling at, or talking to the other. 
These researchers found that when men and women were with children they touched each other. 

 fee mornings 

The smile is always a useful signal to let her know she pleases you. An accidental touch or a brush against her is a further sig­ nal of our interest. 
If body contact is established, don’t move away. Of course, catching her eye and holding it speaks volumes, but don’t let her date catch you at it. You’re right to be careful with football players. 
(Conversation 
I have a boyfriend I like very much, but he drives me up a wall when I speak to him. Sometimes I interrupt him while he’s still speaking, or I wait for him to continue when he’s finished. 
Often there'll be long pauses before he answers me, and I feel. as if I've lost him. 
In conversation, we signal each other with many small gestures called markers. These tell us when someone is finished talking.

Manners give you self-respect 

 r-By 
MARY SUE 
MILLER 

Some people scoff at the idea of e ti­ quette, although few deride good m an­ ners. Yet the two are sisters, springing from a common ground of self-re­ spect and respect for others. 

Any person who r i ­ dicules the protocol of ag re e a b le behavior 
» misses its reason for be­ ing. 

The sole purpose is to sm ooth life's path. in ways that are accepted by the majority of people. 

Surely, in knowing how to proceed graciously in your dally encounters, you avoid many a painful collision. You are spared em barrassm ent and the danger of giving offense. 
Equally vital, you are 
* able to conduct yourself with confident poise. 
Because of your sure touch, you are able also to put people at th e ir ease. And that ability sig n als to a Lovely's 
I charm in most eaptivat- 
• ing fashion. 
Only think of how you w arm to anyone who m akes you feel a tt r a c ­ tive, respected and want­ ed. 
Viewed in that light, w ho could scorn the rules that govern genial manners? Truly winning manners, however, grow deeper than say ing or doing the accepted thing. 
To say " th a n k you” 

^ N N I ¥ » 

 and think “ for what?” is a despicable rudeness. 
Boorish thoughts are as a p p a re n t as boorish actions, and they give far more hurt. 

One m ust m atch the thought to the deed. And to do it, one m ust feel concern for the welfare of all. Consideration is the wellspring of mannerli­ ness and the mark of the m annerly. Not to m e n ­ tion your loveliest self.

The third Backgammon Tournament, open to the public, will be held in the San 
Antonio Country Club at 9 a m. Satur­ day, M ay 21. Mrs. Sue H. Marchbanks, chairman, watches O Neal Munn and 

Doug Jaffe polish their game. Proceeds will go to the Regional Children's Heart 
Center at the Children's Hospital of the 
Santa Rosa Medical Center. 

Some women may he afraid of moving up in the business world. 
That's the opinion of Dr. Martha 
Williams, a psychologist and professor in the Graduate School of Social Work at The University of Texas at Austin. 
“ Women fear success because they perceive it may mean loss of feminin­ ity and can result in isolation and loneliness,” she explained. 
Dr. Williams will head a panel dis­ cussion of “ Feared Success” at the meeting of the San Antonio Chapter of 
Women in Communications, Inc., 
Tuesday. The public is invited to the program, which begins at 7 p.m. in the 
Rathskeller in Trinity University’s 
Coates Center. 
Also, serving on the panel will be Dr. 
Meg Gerrard, visiting assistant pro­ fessor with the L B J School of Public 
Affairs, UT Austin, and Dr. Kathleen 
Adams, who recently earned a Ph. D. degree in clinical psychology at UT 
Austin. 
Stereotypes 

Too Tired? Send money 

While sorting an acc ii mu-, lation of magazines and hooks in the attic yesterday, 
I ran across this ad: 

“ Tired, need more energy? Send $3.” 

Then came a san Antonio ad­ dress and nothing more. 
I couldn’t believe it! It de­ scribed no service, no product — just an offer to accept cash from readers who are tired! 
A friend of mine became rich a few years ago selling five-cent 
Japanese needle threaders to gullible readers for 
$1.25. 
“ There’s nothing to it,” she claimed. “ Von get money from all over America!” 
At least she made a lot of nice little old ladies receive a package in the mail. She did offer a pro­ duct which was useful though over-priced. 
“ I ’m tired,” I complained to 
Hubby at dinner last night. 

B EV ER LY ONEAL 

“ You’re not really tired.” he answered. “ You’re just bored. 
Why don’t you do exercises? 
You’d feel better.” 

Exercises? Bored? HA! “ I ’m tired,” I insisted. “ I ’ve been sorting boxes of books and ma­ gazines in the attic all day.” 

“ I know you do a lot of work,” he said. “ But that’s not the kind of exercise you need. You feel exhausted because you get bored with the housework.” 
I ’ve heard this all-American male philoaophy many times. 
Husbands are concerned that their little women aren't “ in shape” . Their happy housewives are not “ in condition” . 
They honestly believe their lo­ wly homemaker does nothing during the day any more stren­ uous than flipping the disposal switch. 

‘‘For your information.” I raved, “ I have had plenty of exercise today. I chased Nancy’s 
Irish setter over 12 blocks of backyards. I made 42 trips from the boys’ closets to the trash cans. 
“ Have you ever tried to read old magazines in the attic under a spinning roof ventilator? It was like a strobe-lighted discotheque for midgets with no music! 
“ I climbed the ladder into the attic so many times I started answering the phone with Tarzan yells,” I continued. 
“ All right,” he smiled. “ I know you work a lot. But the exercise you get just isn’t the right kind 
You just THINK you are tired. 
You should . . . . where are you going?” 
“ To the attic.” I said as I disappeared from the kitchen. 
“ There’s a magazine ad up there 
I need.” 
It may well be worth $3 just to say, “ Pm tired” to someone who will believe me! 

Dr. Williams believes that women who emphasize sexual, stereotyped roles are most likely to fear success. 
“ A lot depends on how you define femininity,” said Dr. Williams. “ If it means being warm, outgoing, person­ able or sensitive, the woman may have few problems. But if she associates being feminine with dependency, she’s likely to have a rough time.” 
How can women overcome their fears? The answer. Dr. Williams be­ lieves. lies in developing self-confi­ dence and a sense of security. 
“ To some extent, age alone is a cure,” said Dr. Williams. “ A business­ woman may become more confident as she grows older. She knows who she is and her fear of rejection dimin­ ishes.” 
Ironically, women may make better managers than men, Dr. Williams not­ ed. 
“ Running an office is a lot like run­ ning a family,” she explained. “ A woman is often able to provide support for her workers and to build cohesion and team relations.” 
She continued, “ The same sort of skill that make an effective parent also make an effective supervisor. (That doesn’t mean that employes should be treated like children, Dr. Williams quickly added.) 
Besides fearing success, women may also fear power, said Dr. Williams, who has vist begun a study on why women turn , twn promotions. 

DR. M A R T H A WILLIAMS 
“ Women tend to apologize for their power,” she observed, “ They fear its personal consequences. They may fear that they don’t, really have it or that it won’t be supported by the total power structure.” 
Like men, she said, women have varying styles of management or lea­ dership. 
Basically, Dr. Williams related, there are four styles: team, task-or­ iented, human relations and manipu­ lative or political. A “ non-style” has also been identified in which the supervisor withdraws and doesn’t as­ sert authority, leaving the oganization to function bureaucratically. 
“ The team style is generally the most successful,” Dr. Williams said. “ It combines both the human relations and task accomplishment methods.” 
Q ueen hee 

Psychologists have also identified a 
“ queenbee syndrome” in business, she said. 
“ This occurs when a woman has made it up the hard way. The organi­ zation has rewarded aggressiveness and she takes on the value system of the organization. The woman loses the ability to be sympathetic.” 
Such people are inflexible, Dr. 
Williams said. 
“ The key to being a successful bu­ sinesswoman is flexibility,” she relat­ ed. “ In these times a woman must be able to make crucial decisions one minute and fix dinner the next.”

It is not enough to live in a community. 
One must contribute to it, Andy Slane be­ lieves. 
A retiree with modest means and a painful arthritic hip, Slane has gone into the community as a volunteer, identified some needs for food and clothing and worked out his own solution. 
For a flat monthly fee, he buys all day-old ba­ kery products from a su­ permarket and gives the items away to clients on a regular schedule. 
“ If everyone could have one full meal a day, it would change the course of history,” Slane believes. 
He also collects cloth­ ing excess from his friends and thrift shops 
— 5,ooo to 7,ooo pieces a month — sorts it in his garage and passes it on to grateful users. 
“ Nothing is so bad but someone can’t use it —■ if only for cleaning rags,” he says. 
Slane p articu larly appreciates receiving children’s shoes because 
“ a number of kids hero don’t go to school be­ cause they don’t have shoes." 
Slane walks with the aid of two canes and does not own an automobile, but he manages to pick up and distribute the day-old bakery goods 
'every Monday, Wednes­ day, Friday and Satur­ day. 
On Monday mornings he works as a volunteer for the Retired Senior 
Volunteer 
Program 
(R .S.V .P ). Three other volunteers. Mary Saier, 
Victoriano Flores and 
Eugenio Narvaez, help him load and unload clothing and bread from an R.S.V.P. van driven on a regular route by 
Paul Araiza, an R.S.V.P. employe. 
Their first stop is Mira 
Mendes Homes. They drop off about 4oo loaves 

'You get used to pain. Think it away. ’ 

 of bread and whatever items Slane has collected for the clothing room he set up there. Barbara 
Donavan. working for the 
Cap West project, han­ dles the free distribution to residents. 
The next stop is the nu­ trition program for the elderly in the Immacu-' late Conception Catholic 
Church complex. The vo­ lunteers leave sweet rolls for moVning coffee and about 8o loaves of bread 
— one for each elderly person to take home. 
At Our Lady of Guada­ lupe Church, where an­ other nutrition program for the elderly is based, 
Slane leaves bread and cake. He also provides, at his own expense, enough groceries for a full Sun­ day dinner for nine el­ derly homebound people. 
Another volunteer, known to him as Tillie, cooks the dinner and takes it to the shut-ins. 
Kids 

If Slane has cookies, these go to St. Joseph’s and St. Peter’s Home in addition to any bread they need. 
I 
“ The children like cookies and milk as a bedtime snack,” Slane 
'says. 
On Wednesdays, the

Cross) picks up and re­ ceives the bakery pro­ ducts. 
On Fridays and Satur-' days Felipe Reyes picks up the bakery goods, and often a pot of beans or 
Mexican dish cooked by 
Slane, for San Antonio for 
Christ, a halfway house for addicts. 
On Saturdays Friend­ ship House, operated by 
Liz 
Davies, receives bread for 12o people who are served Sunday dinner. 
Represenatatives from 
St. Michael’s Church in 
Elmendorf and the Holy 
Family Church regularly pick up clothing from 
Slane. 
“ Everything must be out by Saturday,” he em­ phasizes. 
As one of the early volunteers in R.S.V.P., 
Slane has cooked for 
Project F R E E , Friend­ ship House and St. T i­ mothy’s Church, helped start the information desk at the Robert B. 
Green Memorial Hospital and taught world history at Healy Murphy Learn­ ing Center. 
Yet this stocky white- haired man, with the build of a wrestler, the face of a college professor and the imposing c a r­ riage of Orson Weils is physically lim ited by arthritis. 
Pain 
“ You get used to pain. 
Think it away. Learn to live with it,” he said. 
His wife Johanna does many things for him. 
“ I can’t put on my socks. 
Isn ’t that humilating?” 
Slane retired nine years ago. His last job was at the University of 
California Medical School in San Francisco where he operated the anesth- siology supply depart­ ment for 25 years. 
He and his wife select­ ed San Antonio as a re­ tirement home based on the low cost of living. 
Slane’s first career was the theater. He said “ I became stajge struck at the University of Denver in 1929 and spent the next 
IO years in the theater. 
He acted for the Denver 
Community Theater, dir­ ected plays at the Old 
Town Hall for a brewery and floor shows for the 
Epley Hotel system. 
From 1934-1939 he dir- ected the 
Federal 
Theater Project and pro­ duced the early plays of 
Mary Chase, author of 
“ Harvey.” 
While Slane was teach­ ing play writing at Cha­ ppie House, a division of the Denver Art Museum, one of his students, Will 
John, changed Slane to 
Shane and named the de-; teethe character Michael; 
Shane. 
Slane speaks Spanish1 like a native and qualifies as a chef — a skill he found useful during lean years. 
When he cooks now', he must prop himself up on crutches. 
Of his volunteer work 
Slane says. “ We (he and 
Johanna) live sim ply. 
Our needs are not great. 
The Lord often fed peo­ ple. It’s our way of de­ monstrating love for peo­ ple in the community.”

HERE’S a full-length view of April w ear­ ing her

E a s t e r bunny knows what 
Amy Carter will be wearing next Sunday, but the kids of 
Am erica aren't waiting for the cues.

More important to them is what they will be decked in when it conies time for Sunday School and the hunt for the golden egg. 
T oddlers and -grade schoolers alike may want denim overalls and jeans for their skateboard lifestyle. but pure prissiness is what the girls want for Easter Sunday. 
A quick check in three local store here indicates that San Antonio children want to look their best on 
Sunday. 
And best- to them is d re ss y —ev e ry th in g from su p er frills to tailored frills. 
The girls in the fix set and under are opting for y a rd s of lace, smocking, eyelet pantaloons and pinafores. 
And would you believe white glov es? The washable eotton-polys, of course. 
At Sunday’s Child, a children's boutique in Alamo Heights, owners 
Ann Tobin Rowland and Ann Maes- sen. have reordered tots' gloves. 
“ Oh. they love them,’' exclaims 
Mrs. Maessen. “ The girls think that's a big deal!” 
Putting on the Ritz for Easter is nothing new. Frost Bros, children’s buyer. Joyce Barney, has dressed children for nearly 2o years. And tastes have stayed much the same. 
Children still want sparkling new clothes for Easter Sunday, she says. 
Mothers may have a strong input in all this Easter finery fuss. But don’t kid yourself, Mrs. Maessen. 
The children are just as interested.

“ These little fellows are people. 
The m ore you care about their groom ing, the m ore they care. 
“They love to look their best,” says 
Mrs. Rowland. 
Tots may balk when they first enter the Shop, but once they see them selves in the m irror, their tears dry. she adds. 
One little girl refused to try on anything in the shop, until a dress and pinafore (in the wrong size) caught hoi* eye. 
“ Oh, I look just like Alice in 
Wonderland.'r she exclaimed in the mirror. She walked out the door, with her m o th er, w earing the 
“Alice” dress. • 
“ Mothers who put their children in overalls, go wild the first time they see them in a bonnet.” says 
Mrs. 
Maessen.- The child who avoids frills, goes for the tailored little sailor dresses. In classic reds, whites and blues with sailor collars and nautical trims, these slenderiz­ ing A-line dresses are just as im­ portant as eyelet and lace for Easter best. 
At Courtney Scott and Friends in 
Olmos Park, children are picking 
“ tailored frills,” says saleswoman 
Kathy Vollmer. 
Scarlett O'Hara 
Boys, even four-year-olds, are dressing in Etons, and the older boys are going for “ three-piece suits just like Dads.” A dress denim suit in poly-cotton is a hit. she says. 
Fashions for older children, six through 12, take a hint from Yves 
Saint L aurent’s fantasies and go romatic for the Easter hunt. 

Miss Barney says year after year the romantic soft looks have been. in, except for one year in the 'lids. 

“ It was a mod junior look.” she recalls. “ It wasn't soft or pretty. I

H appiness by C om parison 
H appiness is the most pursued thing in all th*> world. Whether we realize it or not. each of us i* on a constant look out for it. To make our search easier, let'-, study and then learn the three laws of pleasure. 
Law num ber o n e. Happiness is like beauty; it is determined bv < oui- parison and contrast. If one sought only to be happy, this could verv e.i-ily he accomplished: hut we wish to he happier than most other people and this really becomes a chore because we believe others to he happier than they actually are. 
V convincing and positive proof of this fact can be found in the following l e s t . 
Seat twenty people around a conference table and instruct each to write a list of his life's problems, then let each read and compare his own difficulties with those of the other nineteen. Each would then find that his are least and then re­ main happier with his own lot. 
Law num ber two: Pleasure must be rated as a secondary product, not a sole destination. Happiness must he the assistant — not the principal. One of the chief essentials of happiness is the awareness of being on the way, on the right road; with full knowledge also that life must be meaningful, ever-lasting and without limits. Let us know that those same sound principles that gain hap­ piness here, gain happiness hereafter. 
Law num ber three: Happiness remains longer lasting and more deeply im ­ pregnated when success follows failure and relief follows pain. The student who exhausts him self working his way through college enjoys his “ sheep skin” m ore than the graduate whose affluent father paved his path. The proof of solid and lasting happiness is often found only after honeym oon pleasures end and marital problems are solved successfully, one bv one. 
I ell me, shall we start with happiness a-' a must or end with it as a reward? 
There then becom es two answers given bv man. He who lisps for today and today only says: "start with the fabulous feast and end with "come what may,” ice bags or aspirins. The morally religious one says: "For a healthy and happy tomorrow, start with the fast and end with the feast.** 
S om e Shag C arpets B ring H appiness 
At the very beginning, shoppers for shag carpets should know that: "When shag carpets are made properly, they are good, very, very good. 
But when shags are had, they are very, very had. 
Because shag carpets are so popular and easily sold, there will always be a product made by an "I don't care mill," and sold by an "I don't care carpet store." 
T h ree P rim e P rinciples

Corliss,

Cataloguer 

Q. “ Do old catalogues interest collectors?’’ — 
Mr. and Mrs. A.M., Gar­ den City, Huns. 
A. 
Trade catalogues are treasured as they furnish us with a glimpse of America’s social and economic history, thus 

 providing researchers with a wealth of data pertaining to manu­ facturers and inventions of yesteryear. 
These silent salesmen distributed freely by firms have become flea market money makers. 
Value guide: Cortland

Scarce 

Q. 
“ My, but Cosmos glass is becoming scarce!” — M ary, In ­ diana. Pa. 

A. 
Flea market shop­ pers are partly responsi­ ble for the ever growing popularity of this type of milk glass featuring cos­ mos flowers stained in color combinations of red, blue and yellow. 
Quite often the stained portions tend to show signs of wear and fading. 
•However, pieces are generally priced accord­ ingly. 
Designers were defini­ tely inspired by the daisy like flowers of the tall cosmos plant. The design is also known as “ Stem­ less Daisy.” The plant is an annual favorite, the glass a perennial one! 

Value guide: butter dish, covered.

Q. “ I’m searching for old hair preparation bot­ tles to display in my barber shop.” — Leo, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 
A. Throughout the 19th century numerous hair restorers, invigorators, coloring aids and oils were distributed in square or rectangular shaped bottles of clear or aqua glass. 

However, the persis­ tent pursuer may be rewarded by uncovering vessels in other colors such as emerald green, peacock blue or cherry. 

Dr. J.C. Ayer became a 

 coction which supposedly turned gray hair back to its natural color. 
Hair Renewer boasted that it could grow hair, cure dandruff and prevent baldness. E m ­ bossed hair dye bottles rate as fortunate finds as do the figural specimens. 
Many hair related bot­ tles are in the affordable category, but some rar­ ities can fetch hair rais­ ing prices. Value guide;

American Institute of In­ dustrial Engineers will take a “ Bluebonnet Sa­ fari” Wednesday to L B J 
State Park and Fre- 

 dricksburg. 
The group will meet at 
9 a.m. in the home of 
Mrs. Janie Hill. Lunch will be served in Fre- dricksburg. 

My wife and partner, 
Eileen, can recall her m other's exasperation over cleaning a stove top, and I can ch the same. 

W hile it’s true many advancements have been made such as timers and variable heat settings, the cleaning problem seems to remain. 
It’s out of my area of expertise to suggest a solution, but I can pro­ vide a formula for a cleaner that may make the job a little less irk­ some, and sav e you some money, to boot. 
Y o u 'll need V4 cup trisodium phosphate 
(T SP), J 4 cup soda ash, and Vjj cup sodium per­ borate. (All three items are available at hard­ ware stores.) 

Mix these three ingre­ dients in a bowl with a fork. Store in a glass or plastic jar. To use; Pick up powder on a damp sponge or cloth and rub over soil. Remove dirt w itll a wet cloth soaked in clear water. 

Like any chemical pro­ duct you,use at home, you should store this one safely, label it — listing ingredients and noting any cautions — and keep it out of reach of children.

Recently, she spent IO days as a visiting profes­ sor at the Alemonger 
School of Psychiatry, and she was indefatigable. 
She spent her mornings writing, and then visited conferences and groups of staff, patients and stu­ dents through the afternoon and evenings. 
She has a remarkable capacity for m aking anthropology intelligible to ordinary people. And she pungently comments on everything from de­ linquency to incest. 
Here are some of her observations: 
“ When we start study­ ing delinquent kids and work backwards, we find a lot of broken homes. 
But when we sta rt by studying a lot of broken homes, we don’t find so many delinquent c h il­ dren! Actually, if you study the lives of famous scientists, you will find a remarkable number with a traumatic past.

Dear Ann Landers: 
The wife whose hus­ band had a low sperm count should have been told, 
“Things change. 
I ought to know. Lis­ ten to this: 
My wife and I decided after eight years of m ar­ riage that we wanted a child. The verdict was 
“ A d o p t very low sp e rm c o u n t.” In the meantime. I became en­ am ored of a beautiful young woman in my of­ fice. 
She confessed one day that she desp erately wanted to have an affair with me but her religion forbade birth control. 
When I announced I was virtually sterile she was elated. 
An affair she could handle, but birth control 
— no! 
We had a wonderful time for three years. 

Then one day she told me, ashen-faced (and completely mystified as to how it happened) that she was p re g n a n t. 
I thought surely she had another lover but she swore on her sainted mother’s grave that I was the only one. 
Of course I had to tell my wife. 
She was stunned — but no more than I when she a n ­ nounced, “ I have more news for you. I am preg­ nant. too. The tests came back this morning. 
My lover, who always said, “ God will watch over me,” had a miscar­ riage early in her third month. My wife decided she didn't want to have a baby at age 41, so she opted for abortion. 
So. Ann, please tell your readers, a very low sp erm count can get higher. — Pittsfield

Have no doubts 

DEAR ABBY: I would like to submit a thought in response to lour writer, HAVING DOUBTS, who felt that God was punishing lier by “ taking” both her par­ ents on days that called for cele­ brations. (Her birthday and bedding anniversary.) 
I My brother-in-law died on his wife's birthday. 
At the funeral service, the minister suggested that we think of it as the husband's birthday, too; the birth of a new spiritual awakening of a loved one who was continuing his journey, and returning home to his Father’s house. 
He said, “ Bodies wear out, but the 
Soul lives on, and as we go through the cycle of birth, growth, death and re­ birth. human ‘life’ continues. We miss the physical contact of those dear to us, yet who would hinder progress and perhaps more expansive experiences tor them?’’ 
■ It is possible that the spiritual en- lironm ent that awaits each of us when our purpose here has been achieved surpasses anything that human senses

J DEAR RUTH: 
T hank you for a beautiful letter. It brings to mind this 
Eloquent poem by Judith Mattison:

Doubts 
DEAR ABBY: May I respond to the woman who signed herself HAVING 
DOUBTS? 
On my b irth d a y , God took my 
4-year-old twin daughters. They were playing hide-and*go-seek with a little friend, and both of them “ hid” in an abandoned ice box that had been stored in a neighbor’s garage. We searched frantically for seven hours, but by the tim e we found them they had both suffocated. 
On C h ristm a s E ve, my beloved mother died. 
On our 25th wedding anniversary, my husband and I received the news that our only remaining daughter had been killed in an automobile accident — on her honeymoon! 
. Somehow my husband and I contin­ ued to believe in the wisdom and good­ ness of the Lord. And we still do. —

Upset 

DEAR ABBY: I’ve been married for seven months and my problem is a friend of mine. (ITI call her “ Barbie.’’) 
It seems that Barbie can’t keep her hands off my husband’s body. 
Barb has a husband of her own, but she likes to pinch my husband, punch his biceps (playfully) and feel his chest. It’s always in a joking way, but I don’t like all this feeling and touching with my guy. 
I’m not jealous, I ’m ju st upset. 
Barbie’s husband either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care. 
My husband says I’m m aking so­ mething out of nothing. My sister says I should come right out and tell Barbie, 
“ Hands off my m an!’’ 
What is your advice? — ANNOYED 
DEAR ANNOYED; 
It s your hus- band’s body, and if he doesn’t like being pinched, punched and touched, it’s up to him (not you) to say so. 

Language 

DEAR ABBY: 
My husband and I were both born in Germany. Our two children were born in the States. 

I think our children should be taught to speak the language of our native country, but my husband does not agree with me. 

Last sum mer I took the children to 
Hamburg to visit their grandparent^, and they learned to speak a little in my native tongue. 

When we returned home my husband was furious. He refused to speak to the children in anything except English. 

He says, “ We are Americans and should speak only the language of our- country, and I don’t want to hear any other language spoken in this house!” 

My husband’s attitude puzzles me. Is he wrong, or am I? — MILWAUKEE 
MRS. 

DEAR MRS.: I think your husband is wrong. The more languages a person knows, the better educated he is. 

Dear Dr. Thoste- son: 
My little granddaughter is an active child of two and a half years. 
She began to walk at nine months. However, she walks on tiptoe most of the time, and I wonder if this is n orm al. She runs m ore than she walks. 
H er p a re n ts have called this to the attent­ ion of the family doctor who thinks there is no cause for concern. She is able to use her heels, and does so when reminded. 
I was told that this an is an early symptom of muscular dystrophy. Can you ease my mind or ad­ vise w hat should be done? — A.G. 
One form of muscualr dystrophy (the so-called 
Duchenne type) is char­ acterized by, am ong other sy m p to m s, toe- walking. 
But boys are m ore com m only affected by this, however, and there are other telltale signs — chiefly a waddling gait, freq uent falls and difficulty in rising. 
If your granddaughter shows o th e r signs of muscle weakness such as frequent falling and ina­ bility to clim b s ta ir s , th ere would be m ore concern for m u sc u la r dystrophy or other types of muscle disorder. 
The other m ajo r MD form 
(Laridouzy-De- jerine) can strike either sex. It starts later in life 
(at adolescence usually) and sh o u ld er involve­ m ent is m ore com m on than leg weakness. 

MD is not difficult to diag no se, e ith e r from symptoms or laboratory tests. I ani inclined to attribute the tiptoeing to habit. You may have a budding b a lle rin a on your hands. 
Diet 

Dear Dr. Thosteson: 
Do you have a diet plan for hiatal hern ia? 
— 
E M . 
Hiatal hernia has to be viewed as the mechanical problem it is. For the benefit of other readers, it should be described. 
There is a gap (hiatus) in the diaphragm at the point wTiere the esphoa- gus passes through the d ia p h ra g m tow ard its connection with the sto­ mach. The hernia occurs when a portion of the sto­ mach pushes up through the hiatal opening caus­ 

 ing severe irritation. 
The idea of diet is to m inim ize irritatio n at this point. There is no specific food list I can offer. When and how one eats is at least as impor­ tant as what is eaten. 
D istress is usually greatest after big meals. 
Thus, hiatus hernia pa­ tients are urged to eat small meals with snacks in between. 
They should avoid highly-spiced and coarse foods, like nuts and bran. 
Alcohol can irritate the hernia, so it should be avoided. 
Vitamin C deficiency can occur if citrus fruits or juices cause irritation

S u pplem ents m ay be needed. 
If there is a backing up 
(re flu x ) of stom ach juices into the gullet be­ cause of the hernia, then foods that stimulate these juices (coffee, for exam­ ple) have to be avoided 
L ate evening m eals may cause night sym p­ toms so should be avoid­ ed. If a snack is needed, one of milk, crackers or toast is preferred. These general guidelines should provide a good start for your diet program.

Natural 
Dear D r. Thosteson: I wash my hair every day and sometimes twice. My m o th er says that ITI wash all the natural oils out of my hair, and when 
I get older it will fall out. 
Is this true? My hair is short and normal. — R. 
The w ashing m ight wash the natural oils out of your hair, but it won’t disturb the glands that produce the oil. 

As soon as you stopped washing, the oil would reappear on the hair. The washing itself will not cause your hair to thin or fall out. 
F req uency of hair washing is dictated by the quality of the hair. 
You want to retain some of the oil. But if your hair is moderately oily a daily washing would not seem too much. You might try

Gretchen curb teapot tempests 

WASHINGTON - When Bri­ tish Prime Minister James Cal­ laghan turned up at 16oo Penn­ sylvania Ave. this month, his musical preferences and Welsh background had preceded him. 
The Carter White House aide whose job it is to see lo such things — and a great deal more — is social secretary 
Gretchen Poston. 45. “ born Democrat” from Kansas City, Mo. She is finding the task so absorbing that she virtually forgot her own birthday last month. 
Her strategy is to try to fit the en­ tertainment at state dinners to the tastes of the guests of honor — an often-expressed but not always suc­ cessful aim of past presidents and first ladies and part of the Carters' style that began with their first such dinner for Mexican President Lopez 
Portillo. 
“ We knew Mrs. Portillo played the piano so that was relatively simple if you could find someone like Rudolf 
Serkin who was free,” says Poston. 
Serkin was. and not only agreed to perform but brought along his piano at his own expense. 
Now, less than three weeks and a teapotful of tempests later — Amy 
Carter's reading habits. Margaret 
Trudeau’s fashion statements and Ohio 
Gov. James Rhodes’ grandchildren, to name three — Poston has settled com­ fortably into a position one of her predecessors has called “ a total com­ mitment, not just a job.” 
Discretion 
If Poston is inscrutable and uncom­ municative about what she thinks of such matters, it is her nature, say friends who portray her as a woman of absolute calm and impenetrable dis­ cretion. 
“ She is the most unflappable person 
I've ever met,” says longtime friend and fellow-Missourian Barbara Eagle­ ton, wife of the Missouri senator, cate­ gorically. 
Poston seems to have found her niche. ” 1 feel she was cut out for the job,” says Mary Hoyt, Rosalynn 
Carter’s press secretary. 
“ She's a catalyst whose real forte is creativity and imagination,'' says former business associate Barbara 
Boggs, who with Post and Ellen Prox- mire founded the wedding consulting firm that eventually became Washing­ ton Whirl-Around. 
After a half-dozen years in wedding and convention planning, Poston's mo­ dus operandi is “ working a lot of paper, first. I’m a detail person who feels you have to see it all written out to know whether it’s going to work.” 
She had different plans when she stopped off in Washington in 19Bo en route to Japan and a Department of the 
Army teaching job. A graduate of St. 
Mary's College in Leavenworth, Kau., she taught school in Kansas City, Mo., public schools for a few years, before taking off to see the world. 
She got as far as France for a year and Germany for another before head­ ing in the other direction, via a training

 course at Catholic University here. 
When that ended, she had three weeks to kill and applied for a secre­ tarial job in Raymond Poston's law firm, 'i'd never been a secretary before and wanted to try. The day after 
I met Raymond. I canceled my port- call." 
That was September. By December, 
Gretchen Householder and Raymond 
Poston were married. It wasn’t long be­ fore she had resumed a long-standing interest she once had pursued in Mis­ souri — politics. 
“ I switched focus — from local to national—hut I had always passed out ballots and worked in precints.” 
She joined the Women's National 
Democratic Club. (and is still a member of its board) and before long was up to her neck politically in fun­ draisers. 
Never interested in seeking public office herself, and married to a man almost indifferent to politics. Gretchen 
Poston was a natural for a town like 
Washington. 
Poston's account of how she got where she is today is terse and to the point. 
Mary Hoyt called her on New Year's 
Eve to ask if she would like to meet to talk about being social secretary at the 
White House. Though caught comple­ tely by surprise, Poston remembers that “ I said ‘yes’. I would and hang up.” 
She met Rosalynn Carter for the first time a few days later and now sees herself almost as “ an extension of 
Mrs. Carter. If you can't have that feeling about somebody, you can't do it.” 
She has feelings of “ affection, pro­ tection and respect” for Mrs. Carter, a woman she describes as “ a very gra­ cious, classic lady” whose tendency, like her husband’s, to less structured procedures in no way connotes an ab­ sence of social graces. 
“ I think the word informal is not right.” says Poston. “ What I call 'in­ formality' is when Mrs. Carter or the 
President might turn around to talk to somebody.” 
The Carters strive to make their guests comfortable, she says, but there is also a practical purpose behind some arrangements now beginning to emerge. 
President Curter likes to be at the same dinner table with Mrs. Carter. 
Poston says, but he also wants to be with the visiting president or prime minister. 
Under previous administrations, the

1o4o time is frustrating^, but funny 

W ASH IN G T O N POST SERVICE 

W ASH ING TO N'- It's 1o4o time again, and accountants ar­ ound the land are hunched over their calculators tallying the credits and debits of America’s 
83 million taxpayers. And they have it tough. 
“ I got h o m e the o th e r night at 7 o'clock,” says New York accountant 
Steuart Kessler, “ and my son said to me, ‘What are you doing home so ear­ ly? These four months you go through are probably equivalent to the other eight.” 
The Internal Revenue Service, which claims to know such things, says that 
45.5 per cent of the individuals who file use accountants or tax p reparers of 

 some sort to help them. The IRS itself needs only 35,753 employes to process all th o se r e tu r n s in its IO s e rv ic e ce n te rs. Which m ean s th e r e ’s a lot more work involved on the giving than on the taking end. 
“ The r^ai job of an accountant is helping people understand and identify what they need — identifying problems and minimizing the tax im pact of bu­ siness transactions,” sa>s Anne Slone, the 29-year-old m anager of the tax de­ partm ent at Peat, W arwick Mitchell and Co., the world’s largest accounting firm. 
“ Tax returns are like big puzzles, and I actually have a lot of fun figuring them out. Of course, if s probably bor­ ing to anyone but an accountant.” 
“ It w as b o rin g for th e first It) y e a r s , ” says J e r o m e Lew is, w ho's 

'Is he really a dependent?' 'O f course. 
He's the best cat I ever had. Well, I treat him just like a son.' 

 been working with R egardie, Brooks and Lewis for 21 years. “ Then the si­ tuations you get into b ecom e m ore complex and none of them seem the sam e.” 

“ One of my predecessors once told a group of accountants, ‘I c a n ’t under­ stand why you’re so incredibly dull.’” says Sandy J a c o b s, the w rite r who tries to bring a certain amount of hu­ 

 mor to the Wall Street Jo u rn al’s Tax 
Report every Wednesday. 
“ I’m 38,” he says, “ but now 7o as a result of this column. I have to wade through the sam e stuff tax payers do. 
Only I get a chance to do it: they don’t. 
“ I’m the guy who reads all the foot­ notes, looking for the seren d ip ito u s and the irreverant.” Like most things, there are two ways to view tax stories. 
“ Everybody thinks they’re funny,” 

 says the IRS’ Leon Levine. “ A couple of years ago some farm er who couldn't afford a trough was using an old bath­ tub to feed his calfs. One of them fell in and drowned. 
‘‘So he got to deduct it. You may think th a t's hum orous but it w asn ’t funny to the farm er." 

Doubling ‘Thomas' 
Kessler tells of the woman who listed 
“ T hom as” as one of her dependents. 
“ ’Is he really a dependent?' I asked her. ‘Of co u rse.’ she said. 
He's the best cat I ever had. Ile doesn’t earn over $75o and I provide m ore than half his support. I told her it had to fall into a specific category and she said, ‘W ell, 
I treat him just like a son.’” 
Levine says this comes up frequent­ 

 ly, and points out that “ your doggy or p u ssy c a t d o n 't q u a lify a s d e p e n ­ dents." 
There are frustrations. A Maryland client of Lewis' who hasn’t .vet filed his return got a refund check in the mail last week. 
Someone in California has the sam e nam e and Social Security num ber, and in trying to straighten it out the IRS assigned a third person with the sam e nam e, the sam e 
Social 
Security number. 
There are gim m icks. An accountant in Buffalo will hold a draw ing for his clients on April IB and aw ard the win­ ner a free trip to Las V egas. A chance to win it all back, so to speak. And there are classics. Perhaps the best is

W A T C H IN G G UARD is only one p o rt o f th e boom ing security business 
STAFF PHOTO S T H M DEAN JR 

By RICHARD ERICKSON 
EXPRESS N EW S BUSINESS WRITER 
The term “security” is rapid­ ly meaning more than stocks and bonds for the local business community. 
Security — the business of keeping what is yours — soon will be San An­ tonio's la rg e st service in d u stry , a c ­ cording to one local protection expert. 
The crim e rate is thought to be the reason. 
Good year 
“ 1976 was a very good year for us.” said Don Morris of locally based ABA­ 
LO Security Systems. 
“ W e’re p u ttin g a la r m s in places where, five years ago, we couldn't have to u c h e d .” His firm co v e rs m o stly s m a ll b u s in e s s e s su ch as je w e lry stores and residential areas. 
“ People are com ing to us now in ­ stead of us co m in g to t h e m ,” said 
D arold H all, San A ntonio b r a n c h m an ag er of the national Rollins P ro ­ tective Services Co. 
Hall’s com pany concentrates on re­ sidential security rather than business protection.-,A {lateral outgrowth of the lohg-slamding^ field of b u sin e ss s u r ­ veillance, the nome guard — probably electronic — is iii every resident’s fu­ ture., he believes. 
“ California and New York a re the country’s biggest spots,” the m anager explained. “ But San Antonio has more 

'It ys a virgin market. Right now nobody has even I per cent o f the potential but in the next IO years, it will be the largest service industry in San Antonio.' 

 money than people realize. 
“ It's a virgin m arket Right now no­ body has even I per cent of the poten­ tial but in the next IO years, it will be the la rg e st service in d u stry in San 
Antonio. 
“ It will be an autom atic feature in the h o m e lik e a d is h w a s h e r or refrigerator.” 
The reason for this groundswell of concern over guarding possessions and property is crim e. 
Hall said, and p rim a rily d ru g -re la te d crim e. But, the Rollins man added, such things as the m odern lifestyle also has helped his business. 
He noted that as recently as a few years ago, one family m em ber worked while the other — usually the wife -— would stay home. But now that is gen­ erally not the case. 
“ U sually now the only guy not at work is the guy on drugs or on welfare or out of a job or out of school, and he's at work looking at your house,” Hall 

 said. 
Other firm s in San Antonio also say rising crim e rates are the reason for increased interest in protection from other than the police hut they say there are other factors as well. 
‘‘Business security is on the rise but not to the degree that residential se­ curity is,” said Pat Schindler, regional vice president for Stanley Sm ith Se­ curity, Inc. 
Public more aware 
“ The residential m arket was rather small before, people were just not that concerned. But now with the c rim e rate and the m edia coverage plus the cost of security protection in relation to the cost of a security officer com ing down, the public is beco m in g m ore aw are." 
But a w a r e n e s s also co n ies fro m a d v e rtis in g an d , a c c o rd in g to Don 
Munford, m a n a g e r of Echo Security 
Systems, a local firm, a portion of his increased b u siness is th an k s to the 

 national ad cam paign of the R ollins people. 
• 
Rollins’ Hall, in turn, disclaim s his ads bring in people. 
“ We advertise to put our n am e in front of the public but we d o n ’t get calls from th a t,” he sa id . “ We g et called after somebody or their neigh­ bor has been robbed.’’ 
Burglaries of 
San 
Antonio busi­ nesses, in fact, decreased from 7,283 in 1975 to 7,o65 in 1976, according to 
Sgt. F red Whitley of the SAPD's C rim e 
Prevention Unit. 
In th e sa m e period, b u rg la rie s of habitations increased only by 45o. from 
13,251 in 1975 to 13,713 in 197H. T h at’s an increase of only 3.4 per cent. 
P re c is e sy stem s differ from c o m ­ pany to com pany but m ost rely heavily on some form of electronics

San Antonio E X P R E SS-N E W S — Sunday April 3 I 9 7 7 
Average investor fooling top stock market index 

NEW VORK — The average investor is doing a lot better with his stocks or mutual funds than the most widely watched stock-market index suggests. 

The Dow Jones industrial Average is still off about 5 per cent from its recent 
Inglis. But that should not be contused with what's happening to the market as a whole. 
The truth is that stocks in general had a good year-end rally, even though the 3o stocks that m ake up the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average didn’t. 
On both the New York and American stock exchanges, the average stock is now around its four-year high, lf the 
Dow stock s w ere keeping up. the average would be at 1o5o. 
The strength of the general market is m easured by the Indicator Digest 
A verage, w hich c h a r ts the perfor- 

Jane B ryan t Quinn 

 mance of all stocks listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Unlike other broadly based averages, like Standard and Poor’s 5oo industrials, the IDA is not weighted in favor of large com ­ panies. 
All stocks are counted as equals, so the good performance of second-string com panies c a n ’t be m asked by the stagnation of a few leading corpora­ tions. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 

 up only IO Der cent from its 1976 low. registered in January. By comparison, the IDA is up 35 per cent. 
The IDA average for stocks on the 
American exchange has gained 4o per cent. 
Jack Maurer, publisher of Indicator 
D ig e st’s m a rk e t le tte r, says this means that the little guy. who u su ally invests in the lower-priced second- string stocks, has been getting a pretty good run for his money. 
Iii the opinion of ID’s market ana­ lysts. the stock should soon emerge from its drift and head higher. 
The fact that non-Dow companies are doing relatively well helps explain why so many mutual funds have been out­ pacing the popular averages. 

O f the 165 stock-and-bond funds that charge no sales commissions (called 
“ no loads ”), about 125 have done bet­ ter than the Dow over the past 12 months. 

Utility studies impact on marine life 

A S A R C A S T IC F R IN G E H E A D swims in a saltwater aquarium, unknowingly helping other forms of marine life off Redondo Beach, Calif. Southern California Edison Co. marine laboratory is using an IBM computer to help study marine life to see how they adjust to a warmer environment near the shoreline. The electric utility is analyzing the effects of returning sea water to the ocean after using it to cool condensers at their coastal power plants. 
Ag program still giving funds 

For the sm aller investor, and the larger investor who doesn’t have time to investigate large numbers of com­ panies. the ideal way to participate in this hidden market move is to buy a mutual fund. 
Down on funds 
Many people are down on funds be­ cause of the poor p e rfo rm a n c e ot stocks over the past IO years. But over the longer term 
(25-year periods) stocks have always done very well. 
And even over the past IO years. 61 out of IOO no-load stock-and-bond funds did better than the Dow. 
When it comes to selecting a mutual fund, you might as well choose one th at’s no-load. “ Load” funds — the ones usually sold by stockbrokers — take around 8 5 per cent off the top for sales commissions, so you need an 8.5 per cent gain just to break even. 
That commission would be worth paying if load funds did hefter than others. But studies by Yale Hirsch, publisher of the Mutual Fund Alman­ ac, indicate that, on average, load funds aren't any better than no-loads, and in fact, even lag a little. 
No-loads 
Below is a list of some of the no-load funds that have done consistently well over the past several years. Some are growth funds, looking principally for capital gains; others are income funds. which return a good annual dividend. . 
All were compared for their perfor­ m ance over 1o-year, five-year and one-year periods. For the addresses of these and other no-load funds write for the F ree Fund D irectory, No-load funds write for the Free Fund Direc­ tory, No-load Mutual Fund Assn., Val­ ley Forge, Pa. 19481. The funds follow: 
David L. Babson Income Trust (in­ come fund, assets $32 million); C’oti- trafund (growth fund, $58 million); 
Energy Fund (growth, $18o million); 
Fidelity Equity-Ineome Fund (income,

The Turkish government's depart­ ment of transportation is contemplat­ ing using the commuter plane to es­ tablish dom estic airline service to cities in the remote eastern portions of that country. 
“ The Turkish representatives were most interested in how the Metro is being used by U.S. com m uters,” said 
Gus Stathis, president of Swearingen. 
“ The transportation requirem ents

 are sim iliar — hauling passengers and cargo on short routes on a high fre­ quency basis,” Stathis added. 
In the United States, the Metro II is used by such commuter airlines as Air 
Wisconsin, Scenic Airlines of Las Ve­ gas, Nev., and Air Midwest of Wichita, 
Kau.

SECURITY BOOMING

But, as usual, you get what you pay for. 
“ We’re selling not absolute security but varying degrees of security,” said 
Stanley Sm ith's Schindler. “ It’s like an insurance policy: We cover what the client wants to pay for.” 
Question of money 

“ It is a question of m o n ey ,” e x ­ plained Mike Medlin, an ADT sales representative. “ Most businesses just about have to have protection to cover their investments. 
“ But you reach a point where you arc spending more than you are get­ ting back. 

“ A good system is one that is econo­ m ical and d o es the job a person wants.” 

Medlin liste d the p rice ran ge of burglar detection and alarm system s from a $19-a-month leasing arran ge­ ment to one Houston firm which has an annual ADT security tab of more than 
$2o,ooo. 
The police department’s Sgt. Whit­ ley indicates many of the sam e th in gs the p ro fe ssio n a l se c u rity agencies are offering for fees could be a c c o m p lish e d by a little com m on sense, neighbor aw areness and coo­ peration with the police.

He cites the departm ent’s “ Project

“ The overall concept of a home is m akin g it v isib le, k eep in g it well

Ile noted the police department has a service of security evaluation — an expert coming into a home or business and determ ining weak points which break-in artists will look for — just as most of the protection business firms do. 
“ They are trying to sell a product. 
We sell security — period,” he said. 
“ The recommendations we make are not to any particular product . 
“ Many of those people (protection businesses) say their system is a pan­ acea and that's a falsehood.” 
But, in the end. whether it is because of advertising, resident inse­ curity or actual crime, local protec­ tion firms are finding their business is booming. 
Or as Rollins' Hall puts it: “ It s good for us but not for the people, if you know what I m ean.”

WTM 
INNOCENT! 

By ANTHONY SCADUTO 
Documents from the files of the FBI, the New York City po­ lice and other agencies prove that Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the Bronx carpenter executed in 
1936 for kidnapping and m u r­ dering the infant son of Charles 
A. Lindbergh, was the victim of one of the most scandalous per­ versions of justice in our his­ tory. 

T h ere can be tin doubt about it: 
Hauptmann was innocent. The docu­ m ents I possess d e m o n stra te that every piece of physical evidence intro­ duced against him at the trial in Fle­ mington, N .J., was either m anufac­ tured by police or distorted by so­ called expert witnesses. 
The documents prove that without exception every eyewitness w ho placed 
Hauptmann near the Lindbergh home around the time of the kidnapping or identified him as the man who extorted the ransom money was a liar. This includes Lindbergh himself, who com­ mitted legal perjury at least once and what I consider moral perjury several times. 
The documents also prove that each of Hauptmann’s alibis for key dates in the period between the kidnapping and the paym ent of ransom five weeks later, which the prosecution called 
In's, was indeed the truth. The author­ ities su p p re sse d all evidence that would have supported Hauptmann. 

It is difficult to believe that what was done to Hauptmann could actually have occurred, even back in the gang- busier 3o’s. All of the police officers, 
F'BI agents, and prosecutors, after seizing upon this German immigrant who was unknowingly spending Lind­ bergh ransom money, appear to have made an early decision that Haupt­ mann was the killer of Lindbergh's son, despite strong evidence to the contrary.. 
And they bent the evidence to con­ form to their judgment of Hauptmann. 
Not satisfied with manufacturing phy­ sical evidence against him, knowingly putting liars on the stand, and threa­ tening Hauptmann’s few defense wit­ nesses, they also to rm en ted him between the day of his arrest and his execution almost 19 months later. 
They tormented, him, for example, by planting in the press before he was brought to trial the untruthful story that he had tried to commit suicide because he was so filled with guilt. 

They tormented him by having an F’BI accountant swear falsely, at his trial, that Hauptmann had spent every penny of the $5o,ooo ransom, and then, after his conviction, by sending a state trooper to his cell to promise Haupt­ mann he would not be executed if he would reveal where he had hidden the 

First in a series 

$3o,ooo of the ransom that has never been found. They tormented him by suppressing his own documents so that he couldn’t defend himself against the charges. 
The nile of the press in the torment of Hauptmann went beyond just passi­ vely receiving and printing police ver­ sions of th e ir evidence. 
The new spapers headlined the dam ning news that Hauptmann had written on a board in his closet the address and telephone number of the intermediary who had paid out the ransom money. 
However,, reporters assigned to the case knew that that “ evidence” had been written by a colleague who was hungry for a fresh story several days after H a u p tm a n n ’s arre st. But the story was never retracted. 
The papers kept the sensation going as long as possible, because circulation jumped d ra m a ti­ cally in the be­ gin nin g and whenever a “ new clue” was report­ ed over the next 
3o months. 
The freq u en t editorials chastis­ ing the police for • not catching the beast who had killed 
Lind­ bergh's son c reated intense p re ssu re on d e ­ tectives to solve the crime, to a r ­ rest and convict som eone — a l­ most anyone — for the murder. And then along came “ lone wolf” Haupt­ mann, about whose guilt the public was never in doubt. 

During three years of research into this case I found that most re­ porters and their editors accepted the 
“ facts” presented by the police with­ 

 out question, and used the columns of their newspapers to orchestrate the public outcry for Hauptmann’s death. 
F’rom the m om ent the headlines shouted 
‘‘LITTLE 
LINDY 
KID- 
NAPPED,” all over the country people began reporting that they’d seen Lind­ bergh’s son, and many dozens of par­ ents were held by police until they could prove the children in their baby carriages or cars were actually their own. The kidnap stories pried loose p ractically every cran k and every emotionally disturbed person in the nation. 
Most of them sent letters of advice, foreboding, prayer, or viciousness; m any of them descended on 
L in d b erg h ’s home, offering clues, seeking their share of momentary fame. And an en tire generation of 
Americans growing up in the period re m e m b e r th eir p a r e n ts ’ w a rn ­ ings about kid ­ n a p p e rs who m u rd ered Little 
Lindy and might m u rd e r any child. 
The su rfa c e facts about the case are simple. 
The 2o-month-old son of the then most famous man in the world was stolen from the n u rse ry of his home in Hopewell, 
N J., at about 9:15 p.m . M arch 
I, 
1932. His kidnappers used a poorly constructed extension ladder to climb to his second-floor window, and left it behind when they fled with their vic­ tim. 
They also left behind, in the nursery, a ransom note b e a rin g a p e c u lia r symbol: two interlocking circles drawn in blue ink, a solid red ball within the 

Page I -H 
April 3 1977 

 oval formed by the intersection of the circles, and three holes piercing the symbol. 
A $5o,ooo ransom, almost half of it in easy-to-spot gold certificates, was paid a month after the kidnapping. But the boy was never returned. A body, not much more than a skeleton, was found buried in the woods four miles from Lindbergh’s home a little more than two months after the abduction. 
Lindbergh identified it as his son. 
For more than two years, police in­ vestigated thousands of leads without success. Then in the autumn of 1934 they arrested a 35-year-old German immigrant carpenter, Bruno Richard 
Hauptm ann, after tracing to him a ransom bill he had spent for a few d o lla rs’ worth of gas. H auptm ann denied knowing anything about the 
Lindbergh crime. 
But in the garage behind his home in the North Bronx, police found almost 
$15,ooo of the ranso m . H auptm ann claimed he had been given the money by a friend, who had since died. His story was believed by no one. 
At his murder trial in P’lemington, 
N J., the prosecution claimed Haupt­ mann had built the kidnap ladder and had w ritten the ransom notes; a num ber of eyew itnesses identified 
Hauptmann as having been in the vi­ cinity cf Lindbergh's home around the time of the kidnapping, and as having been the man who negotiated the pay­ ment of the ransom and received the money. Hauptmann was convicted. He was electrocuted on April 3, 1936. 

Because of some ghosts of my childhood, I’ve always found it difficult to believe that official version. Born five days after the kidnapping, grow­ ing up in a largely Italian immigrant neighborhood where the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti was still hotly denied, I becam e aw are around the tim e I started grade school that the adults around me usually joined the name of another man to those of the Italian radicals — “ They framed Sacco and 
Vanzetti just like they fram ed that 

BRUNO HAUPTM ANN: Perverted justice 

German, Hauptmann.” 
Later, when I had become a police reporter with a deep interest in crime and crim in als, I read everything I could find on the case. And my child­ hood doubts were reinforced, mostly because the case against Hauptmann seemed too perfect. 
But it wasn't until the spring of 1973 that I began seriously to investigate this most famous crime and most per­ fect case ag ain st a defen d an t in 
American history. At that time I was approached by a m an, long on the fringes of organized crime, who said he had been involved with a detective who had tried to save H auptm ann’s life. 
He said he could prove Hauptmann was innocent and also prove that the actual kidnapper was a disbarred New 
Jersey lawyer. I began to investigate with him in Jersey. Although survivors of the era corroborated much of his story, his proof didn’t check out and no one could give me documentation. So I decided to return to the beginning, lo the Bronx, w here H auptm ann had lived and from which he was extradit-

A new star has burst into the galaxy of American poli­ tics. It is called Jerry Brown. 
A v eritable cult of jo urn alists trailed the California governor last year when he almost stopped the 
Carter drive for the D em ocratic nom ination. 
Speculation now centers on his potential candidacy 
Jo r president in 198o. 

First in a series 

“Time” magazine called him the most interesting politician in the country. “ H arper’s” tagged him 
The Mystic. 
But even his constituents, whose opinions on him range from believ­ ing Brown is some kind of messiah to the devil himself, do not know him. 

Brown the person still seems to be a mystery, although reams of copy during the presidential campaign detailed his sometimes unorthodox method of operation. 
Brown helps perpetuate his per­ sonal m ystery with his intensely protective attitude toward his pri­ vate life, by avoiding personal in­ 

 terview s and by never allowing himself to be photographed in any­ thing other than a business suit. 
But his outside is in open view. 
Almost everyone knows about his refusal to live in the Ronald Rea­ gan-built governor’s mansion or to ride in the gubernatorial limousine. 
Californians are not taken aback when reminded that he replaced the 

 ed in October 1934 to stand tria l in 
Jersey. 
Bronx District Attorney Mario Mer- ola found the Hauptmann file in his office and permitted me to go through it at my leisure. Less than it) minutes after opening the first file folder I had positive documentation that the too- perfect script w ritten by police and prosecution 4o years before had been developed from evidence th a t w as tampered with. 

The evidence was a small scrap of yellow ruled paper from a legal pad on which was written: Received from 
Asst. DA B reslin, the following r e ­ cords: Employment card record of Ri­ ch ard H a u p tm a n n , carbon copy of payroll F’eb. 29, 1932, carbon copy of payroll, March 15, 1932. 
The re c e ip t w ent on, r e c o rd in g twice-monthly payroll periods through mid-April. But the second date con­ cerned me most. When he was arrest­ ed. Hauptmann told police he’d been working on March I, 1932, the day of the kidnapping. He was a carpenter during the final stages of construction al the Majestic Apartments on Central 
Park West and had worked until a little after 5 p.m. He had then washed up and taken the subway home. Though 
Hauptmann’s alibi did not absolutely elim inate him as the kidnapper, it made the possibility remote. 
Police learned from other employes of the Majestic that Hauptmann did use the subway and not his car to tra­ vel to work. Even if he quit as early as five, washed up. then took a train to the 
Bronx, he would have been home some time after six. He would then have to drive out to Hopewell by 9:15. 
In those days, before the turnpike was built, the trip to Lindbergh’s home would have taken at least three hours under normal conditions, but March I had been a very rainy and windy day. 
Even had he m ade it by nine th a t

AUTHOR Alex Haley shows some of his extensive research papers that went into the writing of ‘Roots’ 

Infighting over 
Roots 

New y o r k tim es service 
NEW YORK — I ii the midst of triumph, there is a sudden taste of ashes for Alex Haley. His p Ii e n o rn e n a 11 y successful 
“ Roots” lias sold more than 1.5 million hardcover copies at 
$12.5o each in 175 days, bringing him fame and wealth. 
But lie is suing his publisher, 
Doubleday & Co., for $5 million in damages for allegedly failing to sell the book properly, and he is also trying to renegotiate and delay a paperback edition by Dell Publishing Co. 

The book, which traces the author's origins and ancestry, has awakened new awareness all over the United 
States about black enslavement and sensibilities. 
As a literary force in the 197os, it is comparable to Harriet Beecher 
Stowe's ‘‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin; or Life 
Among the Lowly," in the 185os. Two weeks ago the Senate passed a resolu­ tion introduced by Sen. John Glenn, 
D.-Ohio, paying tribute to the author for his achievement. 
“ My quarrel is not with my friends on the editorial side of Doubleday,” 
Haley said in a telephone interview 

 from Los Angeles. "M y quarrel is with tile corporate Doubleday, I am speak­ ing symbolically for two groups — black people and others struggling to make it in the country, and writers, who are like sharecroppers. I hasten to add that there is nothing racial in­ volved in the case. 

“ We writers work to produce the crop, deliver it to someone else, and they give us w hat they decide is right. 
They run the land, they own the cotton gin and the company store. I resent the fact that Doubleday is dealing with me now as when I was desperate during tin1 vpars I u ; i s working on Un* bunk 

"I am just asking to be treated fairly and equitably. Corporations do not write books. Authors do.” 
Stewart Richardson, vice president and editor in chief of Doubleday, ex­ pressed his admiration for Haley and the book. 
"I think Alex is a super guy,” Ri­ chardson said. “ When this dispute is over, the main thing is that the book will endure as long as books are read. 
Even if he’s at loggerheads now with 
Doubleday, we’re all proud of ‘Roots.’ 
The book has given a w hole segment of

America a new pride.’* 

Speaking for the corporate side of 
Doubleday, .Tames McGrath, vice pre­ sident and general counsel, said: 
. “ Our initial reaction is that the alle­ gations in the com plaint are ground­ less. We feel dism ayed, to say the least. The complaint says that we ha­ ven’t m ade much of an effort. 

“Still, it’s No. I on the bestseller lists — we must have been doing so­ m ething right. To try to change the term s now would simply be saying that there is no sanctity in book contracts. 

At this point, I don’t see any settlement in prospect.’’ 
The 37-page complaint filed bv Ha­ ley’s attorneys in the California Su­ perior Court in Los Angeles alleges that the author undertook the m ajor promotional activities for the book — including the television dram atization for eight consecutive days by ABC-TV. 
This exploitation, Haley says, helped to create an enormous m arket for the book without any participation by the publisher. 
“ Doubleday failed to provide book distributors and retailers with suffi­ cient copies of ‘Roots’ to satisfy the clearly foreseeable public dem and,” 

 takes 

 the complaint says. 
“ As a result, copies were not availa­ ble for sale to the public in retail outlets throughout Los Angeles and in other metropolitan areas” ~immediate- ly after the TV program s. 
At the core of the complaint is the allegation that the hardcover sales of the book have been harm ed because of 
Doubleday’s prem ature announcement that there would be both a quality pa­ perback edition published this year by 
Dell, under its Delta im print, and a mass paperback edition next year by the sam e company. Both would cost considerably less and cause potential 

 readers to avoid buying the hardcover edition. 

In addition, a highly unusual series of events occurred regarding the pa­ perback edition of “ Roots” in the fu­ ture. 

In 1967, w hile Haley was still re ­ searching and w riting the book, the p ap erb ack rig h ts w ere sold bv 
Doubleday to Dell for $18,ooo. Under the contract with Doubleday, this sum was sp lit — $9,ooo for D oubleday, 
$9,ooo for Haley. Ten years ago, the 
5o-5o percentage was traditional; to­ day, bestselling authors have been able 

 to achieve 6o-4o or even 75-25, with the larger share going to the author. 

In 1976, Doubleday bought Dell. This placed the hardcover publisher in a position of being in partnership with itself rather than, as Haley’s complaint points out, being p artn ers with the author in achieving the best possible reprint term s of a m ajor property. 
“ Doubleday thus extinguished any economic incentive on its part to enter into negotiations with Dell, its own subsidiary,” the com plaint says, “ to increase the paperback licensing fee” under what is contended to be the cus- tom in the book-publishing industry.

Is CCA just another way to 

Poge 5-H 

By VICKIE DAVIDSON 
John and Jane Taxpayer have experienced some gut-wrench­ ing feelings over the City-County 
Appraisal Program. 

Burning disgust — when they've ripped open their mail to find taxes soaring higher than their imagina­ tions. 
Repulsion — when they've opened the newspapers to see one scandalous 
CCA headline after another. 
There’s no doubt the CCA has had its problems. 
City-county politics, jealousies and just plain mechanical adjustments have impeded it again and again since its creation five years ago. 
At the same time, property taxes have escalated — not so much because of the CCA. but because of the massive and long overdue countywide property reappraisal which began with the joint appraisal program. 
For a while last year, it looked as if the major problems were finally re­ solved and the slip-slide ride was over. 
But in January, the sliding started again. 
The City Board of Equalization is­ sued a critical report of the CCA. And then new' County Tax Asessor-Col- lector Ben Shaw came up with several surprises of his own. 
First, Shaw said he should be on the 
CCA Board. No decision has been made yet, but some members of the board don’t want him. They say the joint ap­ praisal project's earlier problems were caused by the presence of the city and county assessor-colleetors. 
And recently Shaw has begun a probe of possibly improper property value adjustments which he says he has uncovered. 
To make things even worse, another lawsuit has been filed in state district court challenging legality of the taxing system. filed by Busby the contends tax levies are 
The suit 
Builder, Inc. too high. 
After five years of bad publicity, uncertainty and controversy over local taxing. John and Jane must be won­ dering if the CCA isn't fated to eternal problems. 
Maybe it's time to get down to some basics of CCA. What, for instance, is it? What are its problems? Is there any future for CCA, after all the trouble ifs had so far? 
First question first. The CCA is the latest form of the city-county joint ap­ praisal program begun in 1972. 
From the beginning, the joint appr- 

 spell boondoggle? 
J . 

ART DE LA G A R Z A ... he’s in the catbird seat now 

BEN S H A W . . . they w o n ’t let him on the CCA board 

 aisal program was aimed at cutting bureaucracy by getting the county’s 42 governmental appraising agencies under one joint appraising office. 

That would save tax money. It would also establish a common fair market value, account number and legal de­ scription for each parcel of property in the county. 

In other words, it would eliminate the confusion and absurdity of having your house appraised by the county, the city, the school district and other assorted taxing agencies. 

Supporters of the joint appraisal program — and there are many — say it’s a fairer method of property taxing. 
With (inc appraising agency it's more likely everyone will be paying his fair share. 

Despite the support of the concept, however, less than half of the county’s 
42 appraising agencies have come under the joint appraising umbrella. 

Some hesitate because they don’t think the program is good enough yet. 
Others don’t want to relinquish their own appraising powers. ft In the 
| beginning, was friction. 
3 years of it... 

From 1972 to 1975, the joint appraisal project was on rocky terrain. 

The project ran through three direc­ tors. And the turnover was usually at­ tributed to city-county political fric­ tion. 
Besides the friction, the infant pro­ gram was hindered by mechanical problems. 
For instance, how can you run a smooth operation when appraisers w ho came to the program from the city are making more money than those who came from the county? 

Then there was the question of whether the new program was pro­ ducing a fair taxing system. Carl and 
Milton Brenner, a father and son team of businessmen, didn’t think so. They filed a lawsuit charging favoritism in the system. The suit was later settled out of court. 

The biggest blow to the joint project during its first years, however, was the grand jury report. 
In late 1975, a Bexar County Grand 
Jury found tax favoritism and conflict of interest were widespread in the program. 
The grand jury report also said ci­ ty-county appraisers were moonlight­ ing for property consultants and that the entire operation was handicapped by the use of untrained appraisers and city-county tension. 
As a result of the 1975 grand jury report, officials tried to improve that situation — and other ones as well. 
When the report came out, lax 
Assessor-Collector Charlie Davis and other members of the appraisal board offered to resign. 
“ I thought it would help the program if I got off.” Davis explained in a re­ cent interview. 
Davis said his name was adversely linked to the project. Not many people would argue that point. 
Davis had been named again and again as one of the project's tension- creators. 
Admitting the tension was terrible, 
Davis recently said the city tried to dominate the joint appraisal project. 
He said 81) per cent of the staff came from the city. 
The Brenner lawsuit also took issue with Davis. The suit alleged he was a recipient of tax favoritism. 
Davis denied it. He still denies it. 
And the suit was eventually settled out of court. 
Despite the offers to resign and the denials, it was too late for him. 
Almost everyone — Davis included 
— agrees his defeat at the polls last 
May was largely because of the alle­ gations of scandal. 
For a man whose name was so in­ tertwined with the joint appraisal pro­ ject, Davis was never one of its stron­ gest supporters. 

CHARLES D A V IS . . . CCA c o n tro v e rs y led to his downfall at the polls 

BLAIR REEVES ... the fight has fo llo w e d him for years 

He said he agreed with the idea be­ hind the CCA. But he didn’t agree with a reappraisal of the county and he wanted the program run economically 
— which he said it wasn’t and it isn’t. 
If he’d been re-elected, Davis said he planned to pull his office out of the program. “ I was announcing the next day that my office was withdrawing from the CCA,” he declared. 

I CCA is born, and so is its v 
: backroom 
, bickering 

Of course, Davis wasn’t even on the CCA board when it was time for the election, although the board had certainly had its history of controversy up to that time. 

What originated as the 
City-County-School District Reappr­ aisal Program had been reworked and renamed in late 1975. 
It had become the City-County Ap­ praisal Program and the tax asses- sor-collectors from the city and county, along with the school d istricts’ representative, were eliminated from the policy-making board. 
The new CCA board was made up of two county commissioners and two San 
Antonio City Council members. 
City and county officials — who were paying for the cost of running the CCA 
— reaffirmed the earlier goals of the project. 
And in late April 1976, they hired the project's fourth director — Art De La 
Garza, a former high ranking civilian at Kelly AFB. 
De La Garza has been credited with stabilizing CCA. “The program's im­ proved a lot since he took over,” says 
Milton Drumm, tax assessor-collector for the East Central School District, one of CCA’s members. 
The grand jury had called for an 

 expert appraiser and assessor. De La 
Garza isn t. 
Despite the praise, there is still backroom bickering about De La Gar­ za and his lack of appraisal know ledge. 
“ We didn't hire him to be an ap­ praiser. We hired him for m anage­ m ent,” says County Judge Blair 
Reeves. 
Reeves, head of the CCA policy board, says the program is pulling to­ gether slowly. 
“ Very frankly, I thought it (the problems) would be over now. I didn't know I was going to get married poli­ tically to this one,” Reeves adds. 
| Now it’s 1977 
?I and the 
I CCA problems 
# are still here.. 

The problem s of the CCA trailed Judge Reeves right into 
1977. 

In January, the City Board of Equa­ lization — which works directly with the CCA — reported appraisals were still inequitable and appraisers were still untrained. 
That January report sparked the temper of county and CCA officials. 
Shaw, his $l-a-year assistant Joe 
Rainey Manion and CCA Director De 
La Garza agreed the City Board of 
Equalization was blatantly overstep­ ping its authority in criticizing the 
CCA. 
De La Garza also contended that equalization board Chairman Scruggs 
Love — a respected local appraiser — didn’t understand the concept of mas­ sive appraisal. 
Some people shrug off the exchange as more political tension. 
But it’s been followed by continual rumblings from Shaw about a probe into property values he says may have been unjustly changed and about his efforts to get on the CCA board. 
And now there’s the Busby law­ suit. 

Is the future j as rocky i 
J as the past 
I for CCA? 
\ 

A piece of state legislation and the City Board of Equalization report could influence the CCA’s future. 
I 

The legislation is House Bill 846 by 
Rep. Wayne Beveto of Orange. It calls for placing all a a county’s taxing agencies under one joint appraisal agency. 
“ It would accomplish by law what we’re trying to do under contract,” says Judge Reeves. 
I 
A similar bill by Rep. Beveto died in the last legislative session two years ago and future of this year's effort can’t be determined. 
HB846 has been mired in a House subcommittee and almost completely rewritten by amendments. It is due to be reported out of committee and re­ commended favorably to the full House 
Monday night. 
Rep. Beveto reportedly is satisfied with the amended bill despite its many changes. Legislative sources put chances of House approval as very good. 
The key to HB846’s future, then, ap­ parently lies with the Texas Senate. 
Nobody is willing to predict what might happen there. 

The Pevcto Bill would probably iron f out many of the political problems in h the CCA. But what about the mechani- t? 

S C R U G G S LO V E . . . his report w as critical of CCA 

 cal ones? 
There is still a difference in pay between the appraisers who were with l\ the city and the appraisers who were I; with the county — even though they all j work out of the sam e South Main 
Avenue office. 
County Tax Assessor-Collector Shaw says there’s also a problem with com­ munication — involved agencies don’t always find out if a rendition has been reworked. 
Board of Equalization Chairman 
Love has said the communications problem could be worked out with a computer — that was one of the re­ commendations the board made in 
January. 
Those recommendations also called for making the CCA more independent of county and city officials. 
Love said several weeks ago the CCA would have more independence if the 
$1 million a year operation were fund­ ed individually instead of with money from the city and county. 
In addition. Love said the CCA Board should be enlarged. 
Love recommended adding the city and county tax assessor-eollectors and two professional appraisers to the board. 
The last Board of Equalization re­ port spoke of keeping politics off the board. But Love said that doesn’t ne­ cessarily mean removing politicians. 
“ As long as they’re appraising for taxes. I don’t see how we can remove ii 
(the board) completely and totally from all politics,” he said. 
Even though some CCA-connected officials disagreed with the equaliza­ tion board’s and Love’s authority to make the report, they didn’t disagree with all of his ideas. 
“ He’s right,” said County Commis­ sioner Albert Bustamante, a CCA board member. “ But how can you have a Cadillac when you have no money for gas?” 

HAUPTM ANN 

 would not have given him enough time to reconnoiter the Lindbergh mansion, which the kidnapper must have done because'Lindbergh, his wife, three servants, and the family dog were up and about in the fully lighted house. 

Hauptmann’s alibi for what he was doing on March I crimped the po­ lice case and so it was simply des­ troyed. The receipt for the payroll re­ cords proved that. At Hauptmann’s extradition hearing iii the Bronx the treasurer of the Majestic management agency testified that the employment records fur that vital date no longer existed. 

At H auptm ann’s trial, the tim e­ keeper at the Majestic swore that the records were missing. But the receipt I found proved that those records cover­ ing the first half of March certainly did exist. 

To paraphrase what Sen. Sam Ervin said about Nixon’s refusal to turn over the tapes to the Watergate committee, when a man suppresses evidence that it is in his power to produce, we must assume that evidence is detrimental to his cause. The tapes were detrimental to Nixon and he tried to suppress them; the payroll records were detrimental to the police, and they succeeded in suppressing them. 

(Later, from police files, I was given a copy of the full receipt of which my first discovery was just a handwritten note. On the letterhead of the New 
York Police Department the receipt was signed by Inspector Harry Walsh of the Jersey City police. Walsh was one of the ranking cops on the Lind­ bergh investigation. His signature makes it certain those missing payroll records did go to New Jersey, although they were never produced at trial.)

M ONDAY in the NEWS; The missing time sheets 

Brown reveals little about himself 

 piped-in Muzak in the state capi­ tal’s park with the strains of Ravi 
Shankar and Bob Dylan. 
None are surprised that he won t take a pay raise, although he ranks 
896th on the state payroll. 
His biography reads like a Hol­ lywood success story; 
He is the son of ex-California Gov. 
Pat Brown, whom he still regards with filial rivalry. He fled to a Je­ suit seminary for three years before attending the Berkeley and Yale law schools. 
His father's name propelled him on the the Los Angeles Community 
College Board and the next year to the office of secretary of state for 
California at the age of 32. 
Now he is the wildly popular go­ vernor (a consistent 85 per cent in 
California polls) of the most popu­ lous state. 
And he is popular with hundreds of West Coast females, who have plastered Brown’s full-page picture 
(via the “ Rolling Stone’’) on their bedroom walls beside the likes of rock singer Peter Frampton and actor Robert De Niro. 
At age 39, never married, attrac­ tive and powerful, he qualifies as the nation’s No. I eligible bachelor. 
Brown’s flair even captured the imagination of Miss Lillian Carter, the President’s mother, who de­ scribed him as the “ runningest man I ever saw.” 
And it is said that if C arter stumbles just once en route to 198o, 
Brown awaits with his track shoes laced. 
So the surface texture of the Jerry 
Brown image is extremely intrigu­ ing. But in purely human terms, who is this guy? 
I decided to find out. It took me weeks of pestering every Brown re­ lated person I could find to arrange for a first meeting. 
And this is the man I found: 
Jerry Brown stood gilded by Ma­ libu sunlight. It was a gorgeous, seductive, blue and white California 

Dreamer's Saturday. 
This kind of scene destroys care­ fully acquired cynicisms about the absurdity of living in a place called 
El Lay and sails you straight back to the belief that when they invented 
Los Angeles, it was in due homage to Paradise. 
God knows Jerry Brown deserved a day off. Anyone short of Lee Ma- jors-in-bionic-character would have needed some time away. He had. after all, kept up a 16-hour-day, six days a week schedule for a full year before he ever even announced for president. s 
Then the pre-convention p ri­ maries had followed each other closely as a string of sneezes, leav­ ing him little or no chance to breathe in between. 
But those primaries! 
Such fabulous, sleight-of-hand, dark-hor­ sey gambles they had been and he'd won them right down the line. 
Moreover, he’d been able to make peace with one of his old campaign devils, the art of the political glad- hand. 
As Gov. Pat Brown’s kid. crowds had been as intrusively omnipre­ sent in Jerry's growing up as a pack of 22 million in-laws. Pat had loved crowds, wallowed in them, never losing an opportunity for a back slap or a firm grip. 
But now he’d finally designed his own unique way of leaving them stamping their feet and standing in the aisles. 
Even after the bottom had dropped out of his presidential fan­ tasies, Brown had stumped for 
Carter brilliantly; some say too brilliantly. There was talk that 
Brown was just out gathering votes four years early for his own bid in 
198o. 
But regardless, now. the crowds that had been the bane of his pro­ fessional existence in previous state races were becoming an increas­ ingly addictive stimulant. 
Jerry Brown hoisted his face up to half mast as he stepped off the sun 

 deck to meet me. Accompanied by a 
Brown staff member, I had driven down the coast to meet him at the home of a friend, Ulrike Kantor. 
“ How do you feel about losing your try for the Democratic nomination?” I started the conver­ sational ball in motion. 
“ I feel different about it every minute.” He also clearly felt like slouching, like hanging out, like talking trivia. 
“ How long do you have here?” I asked, trying to get a fix on the day’s schedule. 
“ I have,” said Je rry Brown, flopping back first, feet up. on the red couch against the wall, “ the rest of my life.” 
As the initial getting-to-know-you questioning begins, Brown asks as many as he answers. 
“ How old are you? 
. 
. 
. 
Twenty-eight? That's the year when your life changes.” His did, he guessed. 
“ Ever been married? Ever come close?” Well, had he? “ Yeah, once.” 
How about kids? Did he want kids? 
“ Yeah, I'd like to have kids. I guess everybody wants to reproduce themselves.” How many? The eco­ logically-allotted two? 
“ That sounds too calculated.” 
Questions that he decides are too personal, questions of an emotional nature, he labels as “ Rorschach test questions” — at one point adding quietly, “ But then everything’s a 
Rorschach." 
All day he eyes me suspiciously picking some mental daisy. I trust you. I trust you not. 
As we walk down the Malibu Co­ lony beach, with all its quarter- million dollar and up driftwood lit­ tered pied a terres, inhabited by its quarter-million a year and up dir­ ectors. producers, recording artists and international jewel thieves turned authors, Brown is treated with un unusual amount of defer­ ence and respect. 

He is, after all, California Royal­ ty. And California doesn’t have much in the way of royalty. 
A lot of the Colony people know him from before, from the days when he was secretary of state and lived in a small, low-profile, high- rent house on Topanga Beach. 

On weekends he would drift waif-like down to Malibu to visit friends and get fed. One of those 
Sundays he drifted into Ulrika 
Kantor’s kitchen. 
“ He walked in from the beach, you know, like guys do,” Ulrika told me, “and said he would like a cup of tea. 
“ We started to talk and I said 
What do you do?’ 'I'm the secre­ tary of state,' he said. 
“ After that he would come out almost every night for dinner. He had no place to go. My husband and 
I were his family." 
Another Colony woman, a sixtyish 
Grand Dame, recalls the time she 
“ invited him in for some lemonade and he didn’t leave for another three days!” 
Further down the beach past the chain link fence that separates the clubby private sector from the public provinces, anonymous well­ wishers roll by in copper-toned waves of extended hands. 

Between handshakes, 
Brown asks an average of 37 ques­ tions per beach-strolling minute. 
“ People sure like to get tan, don’t they? Why d’you think that is? What d’vou think that smell is? Suntan lotion? What’s that big building on the pier? A restaurant?” 
Some of the questions are unbe­ lievably naive for a governor — so devoid of certain common exper- iental bases of reference that I wondered if he has confined himself to too many monasteries and/or state capital offices, too often, for too long periods of time. 
Although there has been a lot of talk about his trysts with Liv Ul- 

 mann, Linda Ronstadt, N atalie 
Wood, Candice Bergen, plus mis­ cellaneous women he has lived with in passing, on the subject of rela­ tionships, this most eligible of poli­ tical bachelor sounds, well, young. 
“ I guess I do like being taken care of.” he adm itted, sm iling guiltlessly, after I mentioned the fact that he seemed to have surne gate m others of all varieties stashed like trapper’s catches all up and down the California coast. 
“ But I guess I’m going to have to start learning to take care of other people,” he added, after thinking the matter over. 
And in reference to a woman friend who was quoted by a national publication as having a few nega­ tive things to say about Brown, 
“ Oh, she was probably just mad because I hadn’t called her in a while.” 
Yet he does have more than a few of the sym ptom s of a rom antic idealist. 

“ He told me once,” Ulrika con­ fided to me, “ He said,^‘Someday 
I’m going to fall in love.’ 
“ He’s just like the rest of us,” she continued, “ who wake up in the middle of the night and wonder, ‘Is there anybody out there who can understand me?’” 
Collaging personal information from a file of Brown’s press clip­ pings produces a composite of a clever but icy man with humors that float well to the shallow side of passion. 

But the Brown I saw that Sa­ turday seemed to have an enormous well of emotional responsiveness and spontaneity held protectively right below the surface; evidences of which he allowed to sneak out with increasing frequency as the day went on.

P resid en t C arter has p ro­ posed that the public financing of p resid en tial election c a m ­ paigns be extended to congres­ sional races. 
The proposal could not come at a more appropriate time. 
Common Cause recently dis­ closed that special interest groups contributed a record 
$22.6 million to congressional cam paigns in 1976. This was twice as much as they gave in 
1974: 
The American Medical Assn., including its political com ­ mittees, was the top giver with 
$1.5 million. 
Agriculture and dairy special interests gave candidates $1.4 million. This was four times the amount they gave in 1974. The lesson of W atergate when the dairy groups had such a d is­ graceful role in the Nixon cam ­ paign did not last very long. 
Eleven candidates for the 
U.S. Senate received more than 
$111o.ooo each from labor unions. 
It is particularly disgraceful that tw o-thirds of the money spent by 15 major House com­ 

 mittee chairmen seeking re-election came from special interest groups. 
Thus chair­ men wield much power and the special interest groups fre­ quently gave to the committee chairman who handles matters concerning them. 
Common Cause reports that more people than ever before are using their income tax re­ turns to contribute to the Presi­ dential election campaign fund. 
On the front page of the re­ turn, a taxpayer can designate a 
$1 contribution — $2 if a joint return. It costs the taxpayer nothing. 
So far this year, 28.6 per cent of those filing returns have de­ signated contributions. This is up from 25.8 per cent last year. 
The program started in 1972 and the num ber contributing each year has increased each of the five years since then. By 
198o, it seems certain that the fund will bring in enough money to finance both the presidential campaign and all congressional campaigns. 
That will be the day! 
B oys’ Clubs must not be endangered 

An important program for young people in San Antonio has been seriously endangered by annual funding crises. 
The program is the Boys’ 
Clubs, where boys and girls 6 to 
16 can participate at almost no cost to themselves in a variety of social, recreation and educa­ tions activities. 
Chartered in San Antonio in 
1938, Boys’ Clubs now have four fine facilities in four sections of the city capable of helping 12,ooo youngsters learn som ething other than the tough street life that can lead to violence and crime. 
But two of the clubs have been closed by a shortage and the other two are in imminent danger. Right now, Boys’ Clubs are $27o,585 short for this year’s budget. Officials and directors are waiting on City Council to decide April ll if federal re­ venue sharing funds can bail out the youth service for the third time in three years. 
The community should know 

It’s time to write off a governmental dinosaur 

 that an organization formed to keep kids out of trouble is in danger. 
The community should know that sufficient funding on a sta­ ble basis is the first require­ ment. 
The community should know that United Way provides only 
35 per cent of Boys’ Clubs’ bud­ get, that the clubs’ officials are limited in the ways they can raise money, and that the direc­ tors are seeking ways to reduce the dependence of government money to stay afloat. 
This newspaper believes the city again should help Boys’ 
Clubs this year. Then the city, 
United Way and Boys’ Club dir­ ectors should sit down and work out a stable, long-range solution that will permit the clubs to provide full service at all four locations and to meet the needs of a growing youth population. 
We also believe the com ­ munity should rally behind an organization dedicated to youth, our most important asset. 

County government should be written off as a dinosaur whose extinction time has come, ac­ cording to County Judge Blair 
Reeves. 
T h at’s a startling opinion coming from a man who has devoted a quarter-century of his life to county business, politics and government. 

“ It’s the biggest waste of tax money. 
I ve w ritten county governm ent off after IO years of being in it,” he de­ clared the other day in a private con­ versation. 

‘T h e action is at City Hall. That’s where the big decisions are made. 
That’s where the future of this com­ munity rests,” Reeves continued. 
Titular head of the five-member, all­ elected Commissioners Court for lo these ll years. Reeves is convinced the system — at the county level — no longer works in the best interest of the ordinary citizen. 

Two areas trouble him: 
• The number of elected public of­ ficials who now fragment county go­ vernment, creating private unassaila­ ble “ e m p ire s” within their own of­ fices. 
• 
The total absence of law-making or ordinance-passing power for Com­ missioners Court. 
Right now, Commissioners Court is incapable of passing legal ordinances of any kind. It cannot regulate m as­ sage parlor operations, building stun-

 dards, dogs running loose or fireworks sales, he complained. 

So the people living in unincorporat­ ed areas of the county are essentially denied general government protection in everyday matters that affect their lives, he explained. 

Ordinance power for county govern­ ment was debated at length last week in Austin but the odds are against passage in any usable form, knowled­ geable observers say. 

Then there is the clutch of elected public officials at the County Courth­ ouse, each with his own staff, budget and space. Reeves listed the district clerk, county clerk, tax assessor-col- lector, tre a su re r, district attorney, sheriff and judges. 

“ Just what are your issues on run­ ning for county clerk or treasurer or tax assessor-collector so far as that goes?” Reeves asks. Ile rem em bers one race for district clerk where the critical issue was how better to fold a 

Need m ore absentee locations 

Absentee voting set a record in this city election with 8,244 absentee votes cast. 
This is line. Absentee voting has several advantages. 
It increases the total vote. 
And normally an absentee vote can be cast in a quieter and more thoughtful atm osphere than in a regular polling place. 
Of most im portance — it 

 shortens those voting lines on 
Election Day. 
There was one serious m is­ take in this abstenee voting. 
There were too few absentee polling places — only five for the entire city — and many people had to go miles to vote absentee. 
In city elections there should be at least one polling place in each district.

 piece of paper for storage, vertically or horizontally. 
“ County government used to be the dom inant form of local general go­ vernment. But its hands have been tied by creating all these elected offices,” 
Reeves continued, warming to his ar­ gument. 

If some stream lining isn’t worked out. City Hall should take over the whole m etro p o litan are a shooting match, the judge feels. 

If some change is in order, however, he’d do it this way: “ I’d make all those jobs appointive by C om m issioners 
Court. Only the District Attorney and 
C om m ission ers C ourt ought to be elected.” 

Reeves would like to see the go­ vernor appoint d istrict and county judges for four to six-year terms. 

The Senate would ratify the ap­ pointments, he continued. At the end of a term, the judges would have to go on the ballot for public endorsement or removal, according to the public read­ ing of their record in office. 
The governor then would appoint re­ placements for those washed out by popular vote, he explained. A system parallel to the one he offered is now in operation in Missouri. 
Looking back over the subject with a shake of his head, Reeves repeated: 
“ lf there’s any answer to metropoli­ tan government, it’s going to be found by the cities, not the counties.” 

Pinching pennies means losing dollars 

The leadership of San Antonio received a message last week that may have been obscured by the noisy city campaign. 
But before it is filed and forgotten, it should be studied carefully by those concerned with cre a tin g a healthy economic climate here. 
It may surprise some, but the mes­ sage had nothing to do with utility ex­ tension policies or sports stadium s. 
Instead, it dealt with education. 
The word cam e from the E nergy 
Research and Development Adminis­ tration, which spurned Sun Antonia's offers and located its primary solar research installation in Golden, Colo. 
Many San Antonians may have w rit­ ten off the choice as a political de­ cision. Not so. 
San Antonio, indeed, presented a good case for the solar institute. And though the Colorado proposal was sponsored by Midwest Research Insti­ tute, San Antonio had the equally p re stig io u s 
Southw est 
R esearch 
Institute. 
The difference? The Colorado

Politics c 

 program will dovetail with strong re­ search on solar energy already under­ way at the nearby University of Color­ ado. 
“ Our colleges don’t have com para­ ble p r o g r a m s ,” re p o rte d 
Lyle 
Donaldson of SwRI. 
Suddenly it should occur to the movers and shakers of San Antonio that there is much more at stake in the proper and swift development of the 
University of Texas at San Antonio than simply the provision of a ware­ house for troublesome kids in their late teens. 
“There’s more to getting a research 

 institute than calling congressmen on the phone,” says Dr. P eter Flawn, president of UTSA. “ You’ve got to have something going for you.” 
There’s also much more to snaring one of the desirable new high techno­ logy industries than giving its execu­ tives a four-color brochure and a ride on the river. 

Dr. Bernard Sagik, dean of the 
UTSA College of Science and Mathe­ matics, points out the key ingredient in site selection very often is the availa­ bility of the expertise and academic opportunities of graduate programs in such areas as engineering, physics, chemistry and other basic sciences. 
“Take the solar energy institute,” he says. "If we had a graduate program in engineering as well as a serious g ra d u a te p ro g ra m in physics, we would have had an excellent opportun­ ity.” 
Sagik has been quizzed on a number of occasions by executives considering 
San Antonio as a site for a new plant. 
Their questioning inevitably gets down to something like this: 

“ Do you have a graduate engineer­ ing school where we can farm out work and where our engineers can upgrade themselves?” 
At this point the answer has to be, 
“ N o,” and it also is negative for g rad uate p rogram s in the physical sciences. 

The big mules in Dallas long ago saw the crucial role to be played in industrial expansion by university graduate programs. 
Not surprisingly, UT Dallas (the sam e age as UTSA) enrolls no freshmen or sophomores — but does have high-powered doctoral programs in the sciences. 
T hese w ere built around the old 
Southw est Center for Advanced Studies and have been heavily nourished by endowment contributions from Big D tycoons. 
And these/ programs are providing the educational base for the rapid take-off of high technology industries there. 
UTSA has received authorization to proceed with two important graduate 

 programs in conjunction with the UT 
M edical School in biophysics and psychology. 

Those who are familiar with the situation find this a logical starting place. But they also feel a strong effort could be made in establishing doctoral programs in the physical sciences with the cooperation of Southwest Founda­ tion for Research and Education. 
Building up the UTSA potential in these crucial areas will take a strong brand of support from Austin and from community leaders here. 
But, instead, state budget m akers led by Gov. Dolph Briscoe are putting 
UTSA on a starvation diet which will make it suprem ely difficult for the school to continue at its present level. 
It appears that even the modest re­ search funding it does receive from the state may be cut in half to about 
$8o,ooo. 
What this sort of pinch-penny policy m eans is that San Antonio, despite many solid attractions, can expect to continue to lose choice high technology installations and jobs. . 

Nuclear disaster is all too possible 

WASHINGTON - The fright­ ening day may soon come when a nuclear nation or a greedy corporation might build atomic weapons for Arab countries in exchange for oil. 
This is one conclusion of a secret congressional report circulated to a handful of officials on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch. S tam ped. 
“ Not for release, reproduction or cita­ tion,” the inch-thick study is entitled 
“ N uclear P ro life ra tio n and S afe­ guards.” 
Prepared by the Congressional Of­ fice of Technology A ssessm en t, it warns that mankind itself is th re a ­ tened by an appalling lack of nuclear safeguards. Almost any country or band of terrorists could easily build a bomb. 
A banana republic, for ex am ple, could hire a dozen or so com petent scientists and construct a sophisticated atomic weapon in two years “ at a cost of a few tens of millions.” Indeed, a primitive but effective bomb could be put together by a single knowledgeable nuclear researcher and a jack-of-all- trades technician. The cost: “ A frac­ tion of a million dollars.” 
Plutonium is the essential ingredient for most nuclear weapons. But since the nuclear power industry has mush­ roomed, the task of obtaining it is no longer formidable. By 198o, there will be more than IOO nuclear power plants in the United States alone. 
At the end of 1975, there were 114 nu­ clear power plants in 18 countries out­ side the United States. But by 198o, there will be an estimated 242 plants in 
28 foreign countries. 

These plants produce reactor- grade plutonium as a by-product, which can be used to build bombs with a force of several kilotons. The less-available 
“ w eapons-grade” plutonium, which could be stolen from nuclear arsenals, could be used for bombs of 2o kilotons, equivalent to the weapons that devas­ tated Hiroshima. 
Although the major powers have es­ tablished reasonably adequate security systems, there is the real possibility that intact atomic bombs can be pur­ loined. Even in the United States, where nuclear weapons are most safely secured, “ a well-trained commando 
(unit) of about 8 to 2o attackers using an im a g in ativ e plan and aid by insiders” could heist a bomb. Such stolen weapons may be “ actually unu- seable,” the study declares, but “ the psychological value of a successful theft would be considerable.” 
Those who would build, steal, barter and sell big bombs run the gamut from rap aciou s c o rp o ra tio n s and T h ird 
World nations to the “ isolated lunatic, the organized revolutionary group, 
(and) profit-motivated criminals.” 
Governments might be moved to steal or trade their nuclear weapons 
“ by the need to obtain a vital resource, for example, oil . . . “ A corporation with considerable investment or ex­ pectation for sales in a country could be subject to pressure” to provide nu­ clear weapons. 

Organized criminals play a middleman role in a black market in special nuclear materials or may steal ready-made nuclear weapons for sale to non-nuclear nations, b la c k ­ mailers or terrorists. 
There is also a credible threat that a mentally disturbed person could get his hands on a nuclear weapon. Psy­ chotics, the report states ominously, have “ been the perpetrators of most known schemes of mass m urder.” 
Nor are atomic bombs the only wea­ pons that can be constructed with nu­ clear materials. Radioactive isotopes could easily be pilfered from hospitals, universities, research institutions, and industrial facilities and used in any number of diabolical ways. 
“ Plutonium dispersed in the form of powder through a building’s air condi­ tioning system or through the open air of a crowded city could be ten times more fatal than an equivalent amount of nerve gas.' 
“ A crude dispersal device could be fashioned by ‘seeding’ a conventional explosive c h a rg e w ith p lu to n iu m , which would be spread widely by the force of the explosion. Even m ore dangerous is the aerosol spray device used in certain medical treatm ents, which could be used to propel pow­ dered plutonium through the air . . . 

‘‘Such incidents would require much less technical knowledge and organizational skill than required to steal the plutonium in the first place.” 
The survey recommends a many-fa­ ceted approach to the safeguarding of nuclear weapons and fissionable m a­ terial: 
• Theft should be made a federal offense. 
• Nations which have expressed an interest in obtaining a nuclear arsenal might be bought off with economic aid. 
• An intense international effort should be made to protect atomic ma­ terials. 
• The Pentagon should execute mock attacks on nuclear facilities to test their security. 
There is “ a widespread feeling that time is running out,” the report con­ cludes. “ Unless decisive action is ta­ ken very soon,” there could be “ ca­ tastrophic consequences.”

Let them splitup too 

Sir; Judging by the spunk the residents of Martha’s Vineyard and 
N antucket are sh ow ing, why 

Jim Dement’* accuracy 

Sir; An Express-N ew s article 
(March 26) mentioned that Jim 
Dement, candidate for the City 
Council, D istrict 9, stated that 
Councilman Glen Hartman was such a good friend of COPS that he was a guest speaker at the COPS 
Convention last summer. 
This comment was made at a rally given in his honor bv the San 
Antonio Police Officers Assn.'s Po­ litical Action Committee which has endorsed Dement. 
I was at the convention and not one city, state, or any other go­ vern m en t officia l w as gu est speaker. 
Council m em bers, state repre­ sentatives. congressmen etc. are invited as guests but never as guest speakers. 
Dement has his facts wrong and I feel sorry for those members of the police association who think that 
Dement has told them the truth in this matter and others. 
There were 5,ooo other convention goers that day who can prove De- ment’s comments as totally being in error.

Mobile home subsidies 

Sir; This is the solution to the housing of older people and low-in- come families: To live in their own homes in a mobile home park, at a price they can afford, instead of high-rise expensive buildings on high-cost land. 
By subsidizing land and uti­ lities, people can live in their mobile homes instead of nursing homes costing the taxpayer a great deal more. 
We know the government has for years subsidized the airlines, rail­ roads and foreign countries. Mobile home parks have been a blessing for the military families and their children and retired older people and low income families. 
Mrs. Mabel Valdez 

 shouldn’t we advocate their free­ dom from M assachusetts? With their two new senators and one representative, and our eight sena­ tors and representatives, when 
Texas is split into five states, there will be an encouraging tilt away from the politics of urbanoids and voting by gravestones.

Fighting mad 

 over fire’ants 

Sir: If people who have problems with fire ants at home could see the two and three foot high hills they make in the fields, they would get their dander up and* stand behind the ‘‘silent minority.” 
When your husband comes home at night and has anywhere from 3o to 35 stings just on his stomach. much less his arms and k*gs, you will know what I mean. These ants' clog up the machines and have to be scraped off. 

Now, whether it is just little ole’, ladies in tennis shoes or our so­ called environmentalists that have helped to take Mirex off the market. I just don’t know. 

This I do know; When the farmer can’t produce the products you buy at supermarkets, the foodstamps and cash you possess won’t do you one bit of good. 

When a cow drops a calf and it dies because of those ants, then things are pretty bad.

"Stupid, inaccurate and irrelevant'’ 

Sir: II. B. Baird's letter (March 
25) goes from the sublime to the ridiculous. His reply makes about as much sense as saying that be­ cause I like vanilla ice cream it is going to rain on Thursday. Not only is his reply stupid, inaccurate and irrelevant, it also reflects upon your 

 blase attitude about what gets printed in your Letters to the Editor column. I would suggest you put something a little more stimulating so I do wouldn’t be laughing on my way back from the restroom.

The Baptist furor 

Several weeks ago this newspaper printed a letter in which Robert 
Franklin commented on the Baptists’ advertising campaign. “ Now that the 
Baptist blitzkrieg is in full bloom,” Franklin wrote, “ two important fallacies have become apparent. One is the phenomenon of unreliable, unstable character witnesses for Christ and the other is the general 
Christian tendency to play fast and loose with the word ‘real.’ 

“ How can we, and why should we, trust the testimony of emotionally unstable people who lost control and direction over their own lives? They were (and still might be) mixed up, insecure, troubled people who suddenly became normal and productive with the personal intervention of the son of God instead of the more traditional psychotherapy. How can we be sure that their claimed religious experiences are not just new manifestations of their old neuroses? t 

“The confused celebrities-for-Christ invariably conclude their sales pitch with the incantation: ‘Jesus is real. I’m living proof.’” 

Franklin’s letter brought a barrage of replies, of which the following are just a few. 

Haven’t tried it? Don’t knock it 

Sir: Bob's philosupy sounds like that pf a first-year psychology stu­ dent who doesn't know the first principles of this abstract science.

Open his mind 

Sir: I am not a member of the 
Baptist Church, but of the Church of 
Christ, and I must comment on Mr. 
Franklin’s vicious attack on my 
Christian brothers. 

Ile fails to acknowledge the rea­ son for God and Christ in our lives today, lie claims one can't trust 
“ emotionally unstable people who lost control and direction over their own lives.” They had no direction in their lives until' they let Christ into their lives, and made Him the focal point of their lives. 

Whether these people are sincere is not for me to judge. I can ana­ state that Christ bas made a differ­ ence in my life, and Ile can change the life of anyone who will let Him into their heart. 

It is enough to know that one day I will come face to face with Christ, as will every person this world has ever known. I pray that Mr. Frank­ lin and all others will open their minds and hearts to the love of God and prepare themselves for that

 concept of life and a set of kind, realistic values, thus enabling him to cope with loneliness, confusion, fear, hostility and despair. Bob’s type of thinking is the very target of 
.the current TV Christian appeal. 
It’s encouraging to know that if s coming through, even though it may be misunderstood by some. 
Instead of calling Crisis Line, call a church minister of your choosing. 
To use the street language of the drifting drug addict, "If you ha­ ven't tried it. don’t knock it.” 
Christianity, that is!

Lost dollars 

Sir: Since the Baptist blitz is in full bloom, I thought I would try to get in some of my blooms. 

First. I am not against any deno­ mination, because there is a false belief in every one. But bere is my story. 

A few years ago I got a letter from my home town First Baptist Church inviting me to their two weeks revival and meet Christ. 

So I answ ered and told the preacher that I would be there every night for the two weeks. 
Aud do you know for the whole two w eeks the preacher never talked to me. 
The preachers nowadays are not looking for lost sheep but for lost dollars.

The selling of a former president and his family 

NEW VORK TIMES SERVICE 
NEW YORK - The selling of the ex-President and his family 
— a William Morris Agency production starring Norman R. 
Brokaw and a cast of . . . well, dozens — is a tale of hustle, bustle and the value of friend­ ship. 

In a little more than six weeks from the time Gerald R. Ford left the White 
House, Brokaw and his co llea g u es concluded a series of agreements that should keep the entire Ford family — not to mention a cottage industry of writers, editors and TV producers — gainfully occupied for som e time to come. 

For writing their separate but equal memoirs for a joint publishing venture of Harper & Row and The Reader’s 
Digest, the former President and Mrs. 
Ford will share what is reported to be 
SI million. 

For signing an agreement with NBC to participate in at least one documen­ tary or news special a year for the next 
Jive years, and to give NBC first option on his memoirs, broadcasting sources say, Ford will receive " close to SI million.” The programs will deal with the presidency and matters of public policy as they arise in the news. 

For participating in two programs on NBC over the next two years on subjects in which she is interested — dance, mental health and cancer re­ search — Mrs. Ford will be paid 
“ nearly half a million dollars,” ac­ cording to broadcasting officials. In addition, she will make several ap­ pearances on the “ Today” program beginning later this year. 

Wednesday night and Thursday the 
Fords will be meeting here with NBC news executives and Brokaw to discuss possible subjects and a timetable for them. 

“ That is precedent-setting, ” said Brokaw, referring to the pack­ age of agreements. “ LBJ wrote a book land Mrs. Johnson wrote a book. But what else did they do? Eisenhower didn’t have a television deal. Nixon is writing a book but his TV thing hasn't been bought by any networks.” 

Henry A. Kissinger, who is repre­ sented by Marvin Josephson of Inter­ national Creative M anagem ent, has 
'also signed a five-year deal with NBG’ for a variety of consultancy and on-air obligations over the next five years. 
From these the former secretary of state could receive as much as $4.5 million. His memoirs w ill be published by Little, Brown & Co. for a reported $2 million. 

Brokaw. w ho began his career in the 
William Morris mailroom 34 years ago at the age of 15, has represented such clien ts as Loretta Young, Barbara 
Stanwick and Marilyn Monroe. He put together packages for Mark Spitz, the 
Olympic sw im m er, and Henry Aar­ on the baseball player, and he lists the singer John Denver and the actor Clint 
Eastwood among his current clients. 
Brokaw also represents the Ford chil­ dren. Jack Ford has signed on as assistant to the publisher of Rolling 
Stone magazine at a salary believed to be in the $3o,ooo to $35,ooo-a-year range. 

Steve Ford will star in a made-for- 
TV rodeo movie for Quinn Martin Pro­ ductions for $25,8oo to $35,ooo. And Su­ san Ford, who is stu d y in g photo­ graphy, has sold a “ W hite House 
Scrapbook” of photographs to Good 
H ousekeeping m agazine for “ thou­ sands.” 

The William Morris agency, as is customary, receives IO per cent of the 
Ford fees, except In the case of Jack 
Ford's job with Rolling Stone, in which 
Brokaw’s participation was minimal. 
A person close to the negotiations said 
Jack Ford turned down a $1oo,ooo television offer in order to work ut 
Rolling Stone on the development of a new magazine about the outdoors. 

Brokaw first met President Ford in the White House last September.

They were introduced by Don Penny, the comedian and gag writer who had been brought to the White House to leaven Ford's speeches. Brokaw used to represent Penny. 

Brokaw , who says he is a great admirer of Ford, followed up the initial meeting with a number of letters and telephone calls and met with the Pre­ sident again in California and in Wa­ shington. In December, he got the nod. 

“ The President made it clear.” said 
Brokaw, “ that no deals could be made until after he left the White House.” 

B ecause of Brokaw’s relationship with Ford, Owen Laster, w ho is head of the literary department at William 
'Morris in New York, had already sur­ mised there might be a Ford in his future, too. Late last year he began to telephone “ various contacts in pub­ lishing to see what kind of interest there might be in a book by either the 
President, the First Lady, or both.” 

One of those he talked to was Erwin 
G lick es, group vice president and publisher of trade books at Harper & 
Row. Over lunch in early January, “ I told Owen that Harper & Row would be very, very in terested ,” G lickes re­ called. 

Laster also began to m use about possible collaboration on the Ford en­ deavors. He thought of Chris Chase, an 

 actress-turned-author whom he repre­ sents, as “ someone Mrs. Ford might indeed be interested in.” Laster sent a copy of Miss Chase’s book, “ How To 
Be a Movie Star,” to Mrs. Ford. 

 in a hallway conversation, Marsha 
Higgins, a literary agent w ho works for 
Laster, suggested Trevor Armbrister, whom she represents, as an ideal per­ son to work with Ford. Armbrister is a, roving editor for Reader’s Digest who has written books about the Pueblo incident, the Yablonski murders and with them Representative now’ Sen 
Donald W. Riegle, Jr., a book about the 
House of Representatives. 

“ I remembered that Ford, who was then a Congressman, had told Don 
Riegle that he had liked the book,” said Miss Higgins. When Armbrister telephoned Miss Higgins a few days later to express interest in working with Ford, she was able to tell him lie had already been nominated. 

In the first week of February, Miss 
Chuse found herself in Palm Springs, 
Calif., having lunch with Laster and 
Mrs. Ford. A week later Armbrister followed her. Both writers were quick­ ly approved by the Fords. 

By mid-February, Laster had nar­ rowed his list of prospective publishers to five, one of whom w as G lickes. 
Glickes recalled that after his initial lunch with Laster, he began telephon­ 

 ing around to various friends, infor­ mally feeling out the paperback, first serial (magazine) and book d ub pos­ sib ilitie s, just to get price ran ges without any commitment. “ Friends do this sort of thing for each other.” he said. “ There was quite intense inter­ est.” 

One of the people Glickes spoke to was Armbrister’s superior, Edward T. 
Thompson, editor-in-chief of Reader’s 
Digest. "I discovered that we were both enthusiastic about the Fords in the sam e w ay,” said Glickes. “ We realized we would have a comfortable, easy, friendly working relationship — which is very important — and we both admired and respected the President. I proposed a major published venture together.” 

When Thompson came to New York 
City the next day, he and G lick es talked for an hour and a half, then shook hands on an agreement to share everything equally. They did not get around to signing a contract until after the Fords had signed on March 9. “ We were just two people who trusted each other,” Glickes said. 

On Feb. 22, Laster took with him to 
Palm Springs five written proposals, including a fairly detailed outline of what Glickes and Thompson expected from each book. Laster. Glickes and 
Thompson all believe it was that pro­ posal that resulted in Harper & Row and Reader’s Digest getting the con­ tract. “ We had really thought it through,” said Glickes. “We were all un the same wavelength.” 

Ford’s book H ill be edited by 
Kenneth Gilmore, managing editor of 
R ead er’s D igest. It will deal w ith 
Ford’s selection as vice president. 
Watergate and the two and a half years he was president. A su m m er 1979 publication date is planned. 

Mrs. F ord’s book will be m ore a personal account of her life, and will be edited by Ann Harris and Harper & 
Row Co. It is due in the fall of 1978. 

For their efforts, Arm brister and 
Miss Chase will each receive about 
$1oo,ooo. 

Negotiations with NBC, however ar­ duous, involved considerably fewer people. On the day of the Carter inau­ guration. Julian Goodman, chairman of NBC; Herb Scholoseer, president, and Richard C. Wald, president of NBG 
News, were all in Washington. “ We all thought it a good idea if we could get 
Mr. Ford to do a series of programs on the presidency and to participate from time to time in interviews on regular news programs or docum entaries,” 
Schlusser said. 

Back in New York the next day, 
Schlusser called Brokaw, a friend of 15 years, to present the idea to him. 

Alvin Rush, executive vice president of NBG, took over the negotiations with 
Brokaw and with Dean Burch, the former Federal Trade C om m ission member who is Ford’s lawyer. 

.Negotiations with Mrs. r o m began after the su c c e ssfu l con clu sion of 
Ford’s contract on the recom m enda­ tion of Lester C. Crystal, vice president of special programs for NBC News. 
Crystal will have direct responsibility for the Ford participation on NBG programs. 

In the world of celebrity selling the only thing better than an old friend is an old friend on a sm all island. As chance would have it, Quinn Martin, the independent television producer of such programs as “ The Streets of San 
F ran cisco” and “ Barnaby J o n e s ,” found that he and Norman Brokaw were both guests at the same Hawaiian hotel last Christmas. 

Martin was not especially pleased. 
“ When I’m on vacation,” he said, “ all 
I want to do is flake out. And there was 
Norman and lie’s got the phones going night and day, making deals, talking business. I couldn’t get away from him. I finally said I d have lunch with 
Jerry Ford’s son.” 

Forty-eight hours after Martin had returned to California, lie had signed 
Steve Ford.

WASHINGTON - One of the sensitive issues facing P re s i­ dent Carter is what to do about the Concorde. The problem of refusing the Concorde perm is­ sion to land at Kennedy Airport has exacerbated relations with two of our closest allies — 
France and Britain. While Mr. 
Carter has no objection to the supersonic plane landing at 
Kennedy, the port authority and the citizens of New York have been reluctant to allow the Con­ corde to buzz their Long Island homes. 
More than landing rights are at stake. If the Concorde isn’t permitted to fly into New York the already weak­ ened government of Giscard d’Esta- ing could fall. The Labor government in England is also in danger of being toppled over by the issue. 
As with all foreign policy issues under the Carter Administration, hu­ man rights are at stake. On the one hand we have the human rights of the

Light Side 

 people of Long Island to live in peace and tranquility — on the other hand we have the human rights of the French and British people who have poured billions of dollars into their flying white elephant and h aven ’t seen a franc or a shilling in profit for their investment. 

There should be a compromise that will satisfy both sides. A friend of mine at the Slate Department thinks he has the answer. He hasn’t cleared it with his superiors so he asked to remain anonymous. 

“ I propose that we meet the French and British halfway,” he said. “That 

 is, we permit the Concorde to LAND at 
Kennedy but forbid it to TAKE OFF. 

“There are some who say this will create more problems than it will resolve, but we must keep our eyes on the advantages. The French and Bri­ tish governments will not be able to proclaim total victory to their consti­ tuents, but they will have succeeded in getting half of what they want, which is more than they usually get. 
“ We are constantly being told that, while the French and British never hope to make money on their super­ sonic plane, their pride is at stake, ll they can advertise that the Concorde does fly to New York we can save their pride." 
“That s an excellent compromise,” I said. “ But if the Concorde can’t take off from .IFK, how do the French and 
British get it back again?” 
“Very sim ple,” he replied. “ We load it on a Metroliner and take it by train to Washington, where we truck it to 
Dulles Airport which has given the plane permission to take off." 
“ That’s not a bad solution,” I ad­ mitted. 

“ IF this is not practical, we could scrap the plane and return the parts to 
London and Paris by air freight,” 
“ That’s a good solution because it would give needed em p lo y m en t to 
French and British aircraft workers.” 
“ The major advantage is that by only permitting the Concorde to land and not to take off you would be cutting the noise factor on Long Island by 5o per cent. The citizens who live around 
JKK should be w illin g to put with that.” 
“ It seem s to me the French and 
British can’t refuse the offer,” I said. 
“ lf they do, it would show the world they are reluctant to compromise. Will 
Am trak agree to transport the 
Concorde to Washington oil one of its trains?” 
“ They said they would, but they can’t guarantee that the plane won’t be damaged in transport when it goes under the tunnel in Baltim ore. Air 
France and British Airways m ight have to do a few repairs on the fuselage when it gets to Dulles, but i f s a small price for them to pay for getting land­ ing rights for the Concorde at JFK in 
New York.”

FERNANDO ARELLANO has been w orking with youths for 45 years 
Commitment to aid youngsters lasts long time 

Bv VERONICA SALAZAR 
Fernando “ Nando” Arellano’s commitment to youngsters for future good citizens has been a long-lasting one. This com m it­ ment started on a cold night 45 years ago under a street light at 
Travis and Navidad streets. 
Arellano, who was 17 then, loved sports. He had started playing with the neighborhood kids at he age of ll but it didn't take him long to realize that the opportunities and the facilities were not available. 
He called a meeting on the night of 
January 2o. 1932. tu discuss with three of his friends how they could start a sports club so that all the kids could participate. Each contributed a nickel a week. Before long the membership of four had grown to IO, then to 15 and 2o. 
The end result was the “ Prospect 
Hill Yellow Jackets Athletic Club." 
The organization grew tu be one of the most effective, successful, and useful recreation programs in the city of San 
Antonio. 
It is the oldest organization and per­ haps the only one is Southwest Texas dedicated to com m un ity work and youth developm en t through sports which does not derive funds from city, state or federal governments. All its funds com e from picnics and other fund-raisers. 
Since that cold night in 1932 Arellano, now 61. has put in over 1o,ooo hours of voluntary work to help make good ci­ tizens out of thousands of kids who found his guidance and direction of great value. 
These many hours of voluntary work have brought him a lot of joy and sa­ tisfaction — m any c e r tific a te s of ap p reciation , aw ards, plaques, trop hies, and cita tio n s — but the greatest of them all came in 1957 when 
Arellano was the first recipient of the 
“ Sports Dad of the Year Award.” 
Guided 
He had not only guided thousands of youngsters but had also led the way to make good citizens out of his four sons 
— Fernando, Mario, Abelardo and Ro­ bert. Any free time he had from what­ ever sport he was participating in, he spent watching his sons perform in various baseball leagues. 
He spent 29 years in the maintenance shops at Kelly AF B and served seven years as a recreation specialist at the base. He retired in February of 1977. 
The San Antonio native was born and raised on the near West Side. At the age of 12 his family moved to the Pro­ spect Hill area, where he has lived ever since. While at Lanier and Irving 
Junior High he competed in basketball and football. 
At 14 he started playing soccer. But by the time he enrolled in high school at Fox' Tech he was not al­ lowed to play because he was too young and too small. 
After graduating from high school in 1933 he started working for a battery factory, where he stayed eight years. 
All of his spare time was de­ dicated to sports. The Inter­ national Club on which he 

He coached all ages of boys. He su­ pervised Babe Ruth baseball teams in the m id-5os which brought 13-and 
15-year-olds into the sport. In 1956 he founded the Yellow J a c k e ts Little 
League and served as its president for three years. 
Founder 
A year later he w as one of the founders of the Northwest Optimist 
COLT League. The COLT team (Cour­ age, Obedience, Loyalty, Truthful­ ness) of 1957 copped the World Series at Ontario, Calif. In 1958 and 1959 it finished fourth in the series. 

In 196o he had a team in the Hot 
Wells league composed of players who had excelled throughout the kid pro­ grams. A year later he brought in the Spanish-American League seniors in high school and freshmen in college who had also done w ell in little leagues. 

Some of these players had been under Arellano’s guidance for the past 
IO years with the PHY J. They made the playoffs in baseball three years. 

Among members of the team were 
Yan Henry Archer, who went on to be­ come a Republican state committee­ man, and Nelson Wolff, who was later to serve in the Texas House and Sen­ ate. 

A rellano also founded the PHYJ 
Junior Soccer League in 196o. He offi­ ciated as a soccer referee three years for Air Training Command at Shep­ pard AFB, and at the Fourth Army 
Soccer T ournam ent at Fort Sam 
Houston in 1968. 
In 1965 he was one of the coaches of the junior state championship soccer league “ Black H aw ks” which were part of the PHYJ. 
Between 197o and 1975 he coached the Kelly Flyers softball team which won 12 trophies and two plaques. In 
1976 he refereed with his youngest son, 
Robert, the Texas Military Institute and the St. Anthony Seminary soccer tournaments. 
Pride 
Of all the le a g u e s and differen t teams Arellano has been a part of, his pride and joy has been the Prospect 
Hill Yellow J a c k ets. They called themselves “yellow jackets” because at the time of the group's formation a church donated yellow jerseys. 

The organization celebrated its 4oth 

Arellano has been the recipient o f numerous citations and awards f o r his dedication to help youths become good citi­ zens 

 played basketball in a com m ercial league won consecutive Texas Ama­ teur Athletic Federation City titles in 
1935 and 1936. 
Honored 
In 1937 and 1938 he was chosen as All 
State Goal Keeper representing Valen­ cia G ro ce rie s. In 1938 the Yellow 
Jackets becam e part of the Spanish- 
American League, the oldest amateur league in the state. The team made the playoffs on several occasions. Arellano m anaged the 
S pan ish -A m erican league in the baseball youth programs for nine years. 
He joined civil service in 1941 at 
Kelly. As a member of the Kelly AFB 
Flyers (1944-1948) he participated in various tournaments throughout the 
U.S. and Mexico. During a tour uf duty in the Navy he played basketball and softball, helping to win two champion­ ships. 

Upon his return in 1946 he continued with the Kelly Flyers representing San 
Antonio in the national AAU (Amateur 
Athletics Union) in Denver. Arellano was the only M exican-A m erican player. 
In 1953 Arellano organized the Galan 
Soccer team. He served as coach and player for four years. Between 1955 and 1957 he served as assistant cub scout master. 

Anniversary in 1972. 
Arellano feels proud “ to have been a sm all part of such worthwhile pro-' gram s. I feel so happy everytim e I walk in a store or happen to be walking down the street and meet with some of these youngsters of 2o years ago who are now grown men, married and with children of their own, and still address me as Mr. Arellano.” 

He is known to be a man of high moral character and standards and all those y o u n g sters of y este ry ea r re­ member him as that. 
He has been recipient of numerous citations and awards. He was named 
“ Outstanding Member of the PHYJ” in 1957 and 1959; received the “ Super­ ior Performance Award” at Kelly in maintenance; and the “ Outstanding 
P erfo rm a ce R ating A w ard" four consecutive years at K e lly . In 1973 he was recipient of the “ O utstanding 
Manager Award in R ecreation" at 
Kelly. 
In 1975 Arellano was president of the 
United Soccer Officials of Southwest 
Texas. Upon his retirement from civi­ lian em ployment he was awarded a certificate in recognition of his 35 years of faithful and devoted federal service. 

He is married to the former Teofila 
Cantu.

FOREST O A K S ESTATES 
WES h om e s b y W . R. C ra ig Construction Co. op e n to d a y 
Spring Opening today in Forest Oaks Estates 

, 
{ L 

This w eekend m arks the 
Spring Opening of new homes by 
VV. FL Craig Construction Co. in the near northwestern commun­ ity of Forest Oaks Estates. 
This neighborhood is in one of the most popular areas of the San Antonio vicinity and is almost adjacent to the long - established and highly success­ ful Forest Oaks subdivision. 
Along Crownpiece 
Forest Oaks Estates is located off 
Evers Road north of N.W. Loop 41o and has quick access to a number of major thoroughfares which lead to many major destination points. It offers ail this, but the community is actually not in the San Antonio city limits. 
The neighborhood’s location, then, yields both great proximity to well known sites and lower monthly pay­ ments due to the absence of San An­ tonio property taxes. The kind of pro­ perty available in the community well lives up to the name of Forest Oaks 
Estates. 
The kind of homes in Forest Oaks 
Estates well live up to the quality for which the Craig firm has been noted over the past decades in San Antonio. 
They are shown along C row npiece 
Street in the neighborhood. 
The prices are the kind of prices 
Craig has succeeded with since the firm ’s beginning. Homes in Forest 
Oaks Estates start as low as $45,8oo. 
Features which typify the care with 

 which Craig homes here are built can be seen during the Spring Opening this weekend. Included in a three-bedroom, two-bath plan, for instance, are a for­ mal living room, formal dining room, family room with cathedral ceiling and fireplace, utility room, master bed­ room with dressing area, covered patio, abundant space in w'alk-in clo­ sets. intercom systems and, especially luxurious, two lavatories in each bath. 
Exteriors for these homes are hand­ somely rugged, creating an impressiv e blending of styles along Crownpiece. 
Even natural fieldstone is used. 
Craig homes, as one would expect, never fall behind the times. Each is built for the future; so, the most mo­ dern of a p p lia n c e s are offered as 

 built-ins in decorator kitchens and central heat and air systems are much m ore than adequate. Energy-saving features also are provided. . 
Forest Oaks E states’ top location also is enhanced by the fine schools in the Northside District. 
Nearby sites include the South Texas 
Medical Center, USAA, UTSA, office complexes and several more medical facilities. N.W. Loop 41o, a short drive south from the a re a , m akes m uch more readily accessible, even down­ town San Antonio and Kelly and Lack­ land AFBs. 
The community is reached most ea­ sily by exiting from N.W. Loop 41o onto 
E vers Road and p roceeding north. 
Directional signs lead the way.

Families like Briarwick 

The stampede of homebuyers who have been flocking to Briar­ wick, the new northeas­ tern community of fine homes by Royal Crest, is no surprise to Ed R i­ chardson, its area sales manager. 
“ Briarwick is the right place at the right time for a lot of families who really believe this is the year they’ve been waiting for to make the move to a new home,” Richardson said. “ Briarw ick hap­ pens to be like one of those celestial events that happen once in a blue moon; where ever­ ything comes together in a perfect combination that’s hard to duplicate.” 
‘Checklist’ 
Richardson pointed out that most families visit­ ing Briarwick arc using a sort of 
“ mental checklist’* to come up with features they’re looking for — and all their checkpoints are coming up positive. 
“ They want fine homes at reasonable prices, with extra amenities like fireplaces and m i­ 

 crowave ovens and fine quality carpeting,“ he said, “ and they re sur­ prised when they find features like that are standard in practically every home we sell.” 
Briarwick's prime lo­ cation, five miles north of 
N.E. Loop 41o, places it within the excellent 
North East School Dis­ trict yet beyond the reach of city taxes, giving fa­ milies the benefits of outstanding educational programs and the ease of lower monthly mortgage payments. 
The quality that is built into every Briarw ick home is evident not only in the exterior masonry but also in the interior finishing touches. The price tag is appealing not only to young families looking for their first homes but also to more established homemakers ready to step up to a more contemporary li­ festyle. 
Briarw ick paneled dens, with soaring cathe­ dral ceilings and brick­ er stone-front fireplaces, are perfect for evening relaxation or entertain­ 

 ing, while backyard pa­ tios are perfect for the barbecue weekends on the horizon. 
Thermostatically-contrc central heating and air conditioning deliver an energy-efficient wallop because the units are teamed with an energy package designed to cut energy consumption dra­ matically, whether in the heat of Summer or the 

 coldest of Winter days. 
Included in the energy package is wall and ceiling insulation that exceeds VA/FHA stan­ dards; turbine roof ven­ tilator; interlocking tre- sholds and special caulk­ ing designed to halt in­ filtration of outside air; and, in most, double­ pane windows designed to make the Briarwick home snug and cozy, no 

 matter what the weath­ erman dictates. 
To reach the Briarwick sales office and to view the model homes which contain all the features that set Royal Crest homes apart, drive north from N.E. Loop 41o on 
Wetmore 
Road past 
Thousand Oaks Drive and soon you will see the 
Briarwick entrance and the Avenue of Flags.

Most brokers in the real estate industry today are searching for ways to better serve the public today. Century 21, the world’s largest real es­ tate organization with over 3,5oo offices in the 
U. S. and Canada, is cur­ rently serving the public well. 
In 198o 
The questions ad­ dressed at this seminar were the needs of the public in 198o. 
Topics covered includ­ ed: developing com­ puters to do real estate workloads, figure buyers monthly payments and estimate sellers’ net closing costs; conversion of agents to employes for more control to better serve the public; advan­ tages of guaranteed sale and buy back agree­ ments; changing man- agement responsibilities;

Northwestern San Antonio offers a un­ iq u e combination of price, style, qua­ l i t y and community environment 
,.-which not only gives Wildwood resi­ 

 dents their money’s worth but throws in many luxurious extras for gooh measure. 
A weekend visit to Wildwood, out 
Bandera Road, offers the home-seeker a rooftop skyline of chimneys sur­ rounded, on all sides, by rolling coun­ tryside and tree-laded horizons. Most 
Wildwood homes feature beautiful woodburning fireplaces that bring warmth and cheery comfort to spacious, paneled family rooms with arched ceilings.

 lation; double-panod windows; special caulking around windows and doors; power attic ventilators; and unusually efficient air conditioning and heating systems. 
Although energy conservation means a lot today in terms of economy, construction standards in an Ellison home permit no compromise with quality and pay off in long-term econ­ omies for the home builder. 
Long-term quality construction fea­ tures include trusses fabricated for extra strength and durability; the best structural lumber available; top quali­ ty paint that resists chipping, peeling and chalkiness for years; asphalt seal-tab roof shingles for added wind protection; brick chosen for its low

San Antonio EXPRE5S-NEWS —Sunday April 3 1977 
Camelot boasts top location 

CAMELOT w ell located in northeastern S. A. area 
SABOR meeting features counsel with 

The San Antonio Board of 
Realtors monthly breakfast meeting will be held Wednesday, April 
13. at the SABOR Audi­ torium, starting at 8 a.m. 
SABOR legal counsel 
Ralph Langley will brief the membership on the 
Texas Deceptive Trade 
Practice and Consumer 
Protection Act. Langley is immediate past chair­ man of the board of the 
Greater San Antonio 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Real estate 
“ The law which Lang­ ley will discuss relates to certain real estate tran­ sactions." said 
Ray 
Ragsdill. president of the board. “ Members need to be informed about how this Act applies to their business." 
The Act declares cer­ tain consumer abuses to be unlawful and de­ scribes the various re­ medies available to’ consumers for violation of their rights. Ragsdill said. 
The original measure was passed by the Texas 
Legislature in 1973 and has since been amended to clarify certain pro­ visions of the Act. 
The purpose of the law is to protect consumers against false, misleading and deceptive business practices; unconsciona­ ble actions; and breaches of warranty and to pro­ vide efficient and econo­ mical procedures to se­ cure such protection. 
Not only is the consumer hurt by frau­ dulent trade practices, said Ragsdill. but the le­ gitimate businesses are also injured. 

Construction of new homes in Camelot is hot and heavy these days to meet the growing de­ mand for Ray Ellison homes in the popular northeastern San Antonio residential area outside the reach of city taxes but close to the center of action. 
Many of those looking at Camelot homes are apartment dwellers who believe rising rents and individual metering for utility costs provide good reason to look into the investment advantages of a new home. 
Lower bills 
The economic advan­ tages of adopting a Ca­ melot lifestyle aren't li­ mited to equity build-up. 
Families are finding that a home equipped with energy-saving features can provide lower utility bills than living in an apartment with no en- ergy-savers. 
Ray Ellison homes constructed since Jan ­ uary, 1976 feature com­ plete energy-saving packages designed to save to Vfc or more on utility costs. The Ellison energy package consists of extra wall and ceiling insulation which exceeds 
VA/FHA standards; dou- 

 ble-paned windows; spe­ cial caulking around windows and doors; power attic ventilators; and energy-efficient air conditioning and heating systems. 
While Camelot econ­ omies are many and var­ ied, the fundamental economy of reasonable monthly payments is still a reality for Ray Ellison homeowners. In Camelot, homes are still available in the $2os and $3os. based on 8 per cent VA financing. Of course, other designs are availa­ ble in a full range of choices, including the 
$4os and even the $5os in 
Camelot’s prestigious 
Brookwood. 
Whatever the peaceful serenity of the Camelot lifestyle, living is anyth­ ing but dull in this excit­ ing neighborhood which serves as a showcase for dynamic Windsor Park 
Mall and many large su­ permarkets. drug stores and specialty shops es­ tablished in the area. 
The three “ R 's" are taught to Camelot young­ sters in excellent North 
East District schools which emphasize educa­ tional excellence and varied extracurricular activities that instill lea­ dership and initiative. 

Military commuters find Camelot located squarely between Fort

Century 21 Howard Tate, Realtors, discuss techniques of appraising investment pro­ perties during a week-long investment course conducted recently in Houston. 
Howard Tate to seminar 

Howard Tate of Cen­ tury 21 Howard Tate 
Realtors was among 75 
Century 21 real estate brokers attending a 
Century 21 Investment 
Properties Seminar held recently at the Marriot* 
Greenbriar in Houston. 
Century 21 brokers from as far as California, 
Florida and Canada at­ tended. 
Every facet 
The week-long course covered every facet of investment - commercial real estate and is de­ signed to sharpen the ex­ pertise of the investment broker by prov iding the latest techniques of ap­ praising. financing, list­ ing and selling income producing properties. 
Special emphasis was placed on standardizing 

 the methods used for re­ solving problems unique to investment properties so as to increase the ex­ ceptional service offered to the public by the na­ tions idc Century 21 network. 
Tate said an additional benefit of the seminar was that it provided the 
Century 21 brokers the instructions necessary to establish an in-house in­ vestment training pro­ gram for their sales force. 
Designed and hosted by 
Arthur A. Turner, an in­ ternationally recognized investment expert, the seminar is part of a con­ tinuous program of ad- 
.vanced management and sales training Century 21 provides to its network of more than 3.5oo affiliated offices.

Texas weather varied 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

Skies over Texas ranged from bright blue to drizzly gray Saturday, as a weak Pacific cool front departed the state to the east. 

Some showers fell on Southeast Tex­ as, from Houston up the coast to O- rangc, with clouds hanging over South 
Texas from Corpus Christi to Laredo. 
Buffalo, in East Central Texas, had over 
13 inches of rain by Saturday morning. 

But dazzling sunshine warmed the 

 state elsewhere, and afternoon highs in the 8o's were recorded from Tyler in 
East Texas, through Austin across to 
Del Rio on the Mexican border. In other locations, readings were in the 
6os and 7os. with a few Panhandle points reporting temperatures in the upper 5os. 

The forecast for the Lone Star State said warm readings were in store 
Sunday, with the chance for a few showers in West Texas as a new front approached. 

Texas Society for the Prevention of Blindness and the Fraternal Order of Eagles San Antonio Branch will sponsor free glaucoma screenings Sunday. 
The screenings, which will be from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Eagles Hall. 223o Hunt Lane, will be headed by 
Dr. Bruce T. Bowers. 
The screening is for adults 35 years of age and' over. 
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness among adults in the United States, according to the society. 
One out of every eight blind persons is a victim of glaucoma. 
Since the glaucoma rarely strikes until after age 
35. glaucoma victims usually lose their sight during their 4os. 5os or 6os. lf glaucoma is discovered in time, however, medical treatment can halt its progress. 
For this reason, the society urges adults over 35 to have an eye examination at least once every two years.

Carter wants to halt 
Soviet wiretapping 

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Carter administration is looking for ways to prevent Soviet spies from eavesdropping on Am erican telephone con v ersa­ tions. 
There is government concern, first publicly ex­ pressed during the Ford administration, that the 
Soviet Union is gaining considerable economic and military' information by monitoring the complicated microwave system which relays millions of long­ distance calls per day. 
Government sources indicated Satu rday that, while the Carter adm inistration is studying the problem, no final decisions have been m ade on how to deal with it. 
Meanwhile, Cox Newspapers’ Washington bureau, in an article for Sunday editions, quoted adm inis­ tration officials as saying that President Curter has

WASHINGTON POST SERVICE 

WASHINGTON — Soviet Communist party chief Leonid Brezhnev is a chronically ill, rapidly aging man with a failing heart, speech and hearing difficulties and other medical prob­ lems of uncertain nature that hindered him severely in Moscow this week. 
Washington doctors who watch the health of Soviet leaders drew this picture last week of the 7o-year-old man w hose a p p e a r a n c e sh ocked 
American diplomats and journalists at the U S.-Soviet arm s control talks. 
Brezhnev’s health is considered vital to the success of the arm s negotiations, because it is widely believed that lie has been strongly committed to sign­ ing an agreement in Washington to cai) his career. 
“ Mr. Brezhnev has had heart failure periodically for some time, and his constant companion is a cardiologist who is deputy health minister and also in charge of the Kremlin polyclinic,” said one government source. 
Jokers can dial again 

W EST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Toni 
Allard, a receptionist at Turtle Back 
Zoo answered 84o phone calls on April 
Fool’s Day. 
Most of them, naturally, asked for 
Mr. Chicken, Mrs. Lion, Mr. Fox and so on. 
But Ms. Allard had the final word. 
She simply told callers that the ‘per­ son’ they sought was not there but left another number. It was for “ Dial a 
P rayer.” 
Youth queried on vandalism 

A 15-year-old was questioned Satur­ day by juvenile officers in connection with the burglary and vandalism of a junior high school. 
Police said several boys were seen 
Friday night at Pat Neff Junior High 
School, 5227 Evers Road, burning gym clothes and breaking several windows. 
Officers said the gym showers were turned on and a fire extinguisher was used to dam age the building. 
About $3,ooo in dam ages were esti­ mated in the incident. 

Producemen will convene in S.A. 

SPECIAL TO THE EXPRESS N EW S 
FO RT M Y E R S. FLA. - The N a­ tional A ssn . of P ro d u ce M ark et 
Managers will hold its 1978 conference in San Antonio, according to Market 
Square Dir. Cliff Edgar. 
The association was invited by the 
San Antonio Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. 
Edgar, attending the 1977 NAPMM meeting here, said the group repre­ sents produce m arkets across the U.S., 
Canada and Australia. 

“ Heart failu re " in m edical term s means a heart that chronically or per­ iodically fails to supply the body with enough blood. 
Brezhnev’s heart failure was called 
“ mild” but still disabling to the point where W estern o b se rv e rs think it highly possible, though they are not certain, that he had had an electronic 
“ cardiac p acem ak er” implanted in­ side his chest. 
R eporters noted that both Brezh ­ nev’s m ovem ents and speech were slu rre d when he a p p e a re d before them. 
Such observations made medical ob­ se rv e r s think of the p o ssib ility <>t either a stroke or brain tumor, alth­ ough they are fur from ready to state a conclusion. 
Brezhnev also failed to respond to reporters’ questions. Apparently he did not hear them, it was later learned. 
Hearing aid 
He sometimes wears a hearing aid, and durin g negotiations, it was re­ ported, American officials had to raise their voices to make themselves heard. 
“ He has had slurred speech caused by recurrent jaw and dental problems for a long time,” one medical source said. “ That’s probably what is bother­ ing him now rather than a stroke, though we don’t know for certain. We must just sit back and watch.” 
The “ we.” it was explained, refers to a sm all group of doctors in various federal agencies who scrutinize films and television clips of the R ussian leader, interview those who have seem him and gather other snippets of me­ dical information. 
Brezhnev’s chronic speech problem was triggered by a jaw infection about five years ago, it was stated. 
That in turn was part of a series of dental problem s that m ade the Rus­ sian leaders’s jaw hurt so much that on one public occasion he took his teeth out and stepped on them. 
Even before the SALT talks, it was said. Brezhnev had not been well re­ cently and had missed meetings. 
“ This is far from a diagnosis.” an­ other source cautioned. "H e did look bad this week, but he has looked bad sometimes in the past. There is much we don’t know . There are probably not very many people even in Russia who do know.” 

 approved a top-secret project aim ed at foiling the eavesdroppers. Administration spokesm en had no immediate comment on the report. 
The Cox Newspapers’ articles quoted adm in stra­ tion sources as saying that C arter, follow ing a review by the National Security Council, signed a memorandum a week ago d ealin g with po ssib le steps to neutralize Soviet eavesdropping. 
One option under consideration, according to the 
Cox Newspapers’ article, would use sophisticated new " s c r a m b le r s ” that would m ak e it virtually impossible for spies to monitor telephone culls in which businessm en discuss with governm en t of­ ficials investments, technical developments or other information that might be useful to the Soviets. 
Intrusion 
“ An informed source said that Carter ordered that the project be administered by the White House and not by the Pentagon’s super-secret National Security 
Agency (N’SA) because of concern over intrusion by the military into private business affairs,” the story said. NSA usually deals with security over govern­ ment communications programs. 
The White House Office of Telecommunications is studying the policy aspects of the project, the Cox 
Newspapers’ article said. 
There have been numerous reports — never of­ ficially confirmed — that Soviet agents eavesdrop­ ping on long distance calls in the United States are able to sort out the calls that interest them from among the millions carried daily via m icrow ave relays. 
Then-Viee President Nelson A. Rockefeller said in a speech last Jun e that Soviet-bloc nations “ invade the privacy of U.S. citizens by listening to telephone conversations within the United States and through­ out the world.” 
“ Information so recorded can be stored and an­ alyzed through computer technology for m yriads of usages, all deeply disturbing,” Rockefeller said. 
The Cox story said IOU governm ent offices are testing the new scrambler system, which was said to be virtually impregnable because it uses constantly changing codes. 
The government is considering in stalling such equipment in corporate o ffices th rough out the 
Country for business personnel lo use when they discuss sensitive defense and technological infor­ mation with the government via telephone, the story said.

Rear license plates suddenly be­ came “ hot” items Saturday. 
P o lice rep orted re c e iv in g a 

 number of complaints from citizens saying their rear plates had been stolen. 
O fficers theorized the culprits

 small of the back against the bed by leaning slightly forward and pulling in your stomach muscles. 
It is sometimes helpful to lie on the floor with a rolled towel placed under the neck and with your buttocks up against the legs of a chair and your feet resting on the seat of the chair. 
The chair should be high enough to exert a mild upward lift on the hips. 
You can remain in that position for five to :M) minutes. 
If you have a severe pain episode that does not diminish after a day or so, Friedmann says, you should con­ sult a doctor. For milder episodes of pain, it may not be necessary to re­ main in bed. 
The key is to work into a physical exercise program slowly and in the proper sequence. 

The exercises are outlined in a book called “ Freedom from Backaches.” which F rie d m a n n wrote with Law­ rence Gabon, a medical writer, in 1973. 

 but also of abdominal muscles i i i the onset of back pain. 
A firm structure of stomach muscles makes it possible to lift heavy weights that might otherwise break the spine. 
Strong abdominal muscles also keep the stomach from sagging forward, im posing d an g ero u s stre ss on the lower region of the spine. 
Exercises to strengthen the stomach muscles have become an important part of therapy for back pain. 
Friedm ann said that the so-called 
“ slipped" disc has become a popular, even fashionable, excuse for backache. 
V\ hat is a slipped disc? 
T here is a g elatino us m a te ria l between the vertebrae of the back that acts as a shock abosrber. When there is damage to the membrane that holds the gelatinous material in place, it can slip out. and press on the nerves of the spinal cord. 
Usually. Friedmann, says, the pain from that pressure is felt down the backs of the legs rather than in the buck. 
Weak muscles 
He and other doctors also have found many persons with degenerated discs whose pain is due to weak abdominal muscles or muscle spasms rather than the slipped discs. An X-ray of his wife's back shows that what appears to be a severely slipped, or herniated, disc. 
Yet, he says, she leads a normal, pa in-free life. 
“ Medicine has its fads." Friedmann says "Some family physicians believe that chronic hack pain is either in your head or is due to a herniated disc." 
Firedmann argues that neither pain nor surg ery are inevitable when a slipped disc occurs, although psycho­ logical factors can sometimes make it 

N tW S D A Y SERVICE 
NKW YORK — One of the curses of modern life is back pain. An estim ated 6 million 
Americans suffer from it. 
Many of them have gone to great lengths to seek relief, including nu­ merous visits to d o c to rs and physical therapists and. often, surgery as well. 
T h ere are m a n y causes for back­ aches. some of which m a y . indeed, re­ q uire su rg e ry . But it is becom ing w ell-estab lish ed that the g rea t majority of backaches are due to poor muscle conditioning. 

One study o f 5,ooo patients with hack pain at two New * City hospitals found that 81 per cent o f them had no underlying organic problems 

 difficult to convince patients other­ wise. 
“There is no doubt that the percep­ tion of pain is strongly modified by the mental attitude of the person. We have to try to get the people not to consider themselves as invalids. 
Some of them automatically assume failure.” 
Commonsense steps 
While he does not dismiss lightly the organic causes for some backaches. 
Friedmann said that the majority of persons suffering from back pain, those with poor muscle tone, can take 

Mostly muscles 

One study of 5.ooo patients with hack pain at two New York City hospitals found that Kl per cent of them had no underlying organic problems such as damaged vertebrae, ruptured discs or arthritis. 
Dr. Lawrence Friedm ann, head of rehabilitation medicine al the Nassau 
County Medical C enter, says most back-pain cases result from “ either inelastic muscles or weak muscles." 
Part of the reason is sedentary li­ festyle. in which m uscles are victi­ mized by disuse. 
Another factor is anxiety and ner­ vous tension, which can tighten m us­ cles and make them or more suscepti­ ble to strain and spasms. 
For those susceptible to backaches the provocations include poor posture, stooping in the garden, improper lift­ ing ol packages, a quick, inadvertant move, or even a coughing fit — all can lead to trouble for poorly conditioned muscles. 

Many studies have pointed to the importance not only of back muscles

T rinity getting 
$5oo,ooo 

Trinity University has received a 
$5oo,ooo gift from the Houston Endow­ ment. Inc., to help build a new library. 
The g ift brought the university within $264,ooo of its $4,365 million goal. 
Houston Endow m ent and its president. J. H. ( reekmore. have been major supporters of the fund raising effort since its beginning, according to 
Trinity’s acting president, Bruce Tho­ mas. 
The foundation contributed $5oo,ooo in early 1973 to initiate the library building fund and another $5oo,ooo midway in the fund raising effort. 
This gift brings the foundation’s to­ tal contribution to $1,5 million. 
“ I find it almost im possible to ex­ press adequately the appreciation of all of us here at Trinity for the gener­ osity the Houston Endowm ent has shown to the needs of Trinity Univer­ sity.” Dean Thomas said. 
Thomas also noted the importance of the new library to the university. 
“ The facility is critically important due to the rapid growth the university has seen over the last two decades. 
"T h e proposed new library is the last m ajor building planned for the 
Trinity cam pus and will effectively complete one of the most attractive and functional academic facilities in the nation,” Thomas said.

The group was formed to help Hy­ poglycemics and their families cope w Uh the blood sugar disorder. 
Hypoglycemia is a condition charac­ terized by rapid drops in blood sugar after eating carbohydrates, especially sweets. It can bring on chronic fatigue, depression, inward trembling, irrita­ bility and abnorm al cravin g for sweets.

SCOTTY ROBERTSON and Sandy Sandoval, left to right, bring in w alleye net trap at Canyon 

R i v e r w a l l e v e w 
Richard C. Sandoval of San An­ tonio displays a 
1-pound 
14-ounce fem ale walleye he caught in the Medina River 
March 23. The fish hit a yellow jig as Sandoval was fishing at night for white bass. The wal­ leye was three to four miles above Medina Lake.

Strip is under way 

Canyon wal I .eyes feed ' ti nie si nil ti j si ti 

BEAUMONT - Striped bass are congregating around the 
Toledo Bend dam, and the an­ nual war between outlaw striper fishermen and Texas game wardens is under way, 
Areas around the dam gates are off lim its to fishing, yet some anglers sneak into the restricted spots under cover of darkness to catch stripers. 
Most fisherman are content to fish on foot from the dam riprap or by boat from the are a in front of the dam where fishing is legal and where do­ zens of anglers have legally caught stripers during March. 
But, according to Parks and Wildlife 
Department law enforcement officials, some fisherm an are willing to risk fines ranging from $1oo to $2oo for fishing in the illegal areas. 
There have been reports of two out­ law fishermen who caught 34 stripers and a group of five fisherman who took 
93 striped bass. The limit is three per person. Speculation is the large, illegal 

 ially hauls are being sold com mer 
P&WD game wardens are patrolling the dam as often as possible and al­ ready have m ade a num ber of suc­ cessful raids on outlaws. 
After one recent night raid during which several illegal striper fishermen were nabbed, two wardens were rest­ ing at the darn, when they spied a fisherman climbing the fence into the restricted area. 
The wardens immediately stood up. but the approaching fisherman yelled to them to relax, tellin g them lie wasn't a game warden. 
The fisherman walked to the dam and soon caught two stripers while the wardens looked on. 
The angler developed a backlash in his line and tucked a flashlight under his arm to put some light on tho reel. 
At this time one of the wardens ap­ proached and stuck his badge in the beam of light. 
Without looking up the illegal fish­ erman said: “ I hope that's not what I think it is.” 
It was. 

By DAN KLEPPER 
OUTDOOR EDITOR 
If walleyes go on post-spawn feeding binges, now is the time for anglers to try catching the fish in South Texas lakes such as 
Canyon and Medina. 
Most of the fish apparently have spaw ned or are in the process of spawning, and fisheries biologists with the Parks and Wildlife Department have been busy attempting to collect eggs and fertilize them so that they can be hatched in jars instead of naturally on the lake bottom. 
The state wants about 2o million walleyes for stocking this year. It was hoped millions of the fish would be produced by strip p in g m ales and females in seven reservoirs, including 
Canyon. 
The remainder of the walleyes will be imported from New Mexico and 
Nebraska. 
Canyon failed to provide its fair share of walleye eggs for the hatching jars. After several weeks of waiting by the delivery room door like expectant fathers, biologists managed to get only about 3oo,ooo eggs from four females. 
A fifth fish, ripe and full, was sent to the Ingram research station. 
Problems 
The walleye might have two spawn­ ing problems in lakes as far south as 
Canyon: Water temperature and pre­ dation. 
Water tem perature apparently has an effect on hatching success. If the eggs are fertilized in water tempera­ tures of 45 to 5o degrees, the number of eggs which hatch is high. 
However, if the eggs are fertilized at a temperature of 6o degrees, hatching success shows a marked decline. 
Male walleyes were ready and wait­ ing at the "right” water temperature at Canyon, but the females didn't show­ up until the water had reached 59 to 6o degrees. 

This is an indication that what is called the photo period (the number of hours of light each day) might have as much to do with egg development as temperature. lf it does, water temperatures in this part of the country might be above optimum before days are long enough to allow full egg development. The re­ sult m ight be only ’lim ited natural spawning success year after year. 
Since w a rm e r w ater m ean s low hatching success, the strip p in g of females by hand and the fertilization of the eggs artificially in cold w ater might prove to be extremely important to the future of walleye fishing in this area. 
After the eggs are fertilized and be­ come water hardened at 45 degrees. 

 perhaps then they could be returned to the lake for increased hatching suc­ cess. 
The second problem at Canyon, pre­ dation. probably is impossible to solve. 
A few days ago. when biologists caught 

Eggs and milt will be em itted si­ m ultaneously. The eggs fall to the bottom and lodge in the rock or gravel. 
If the eggs are not covered by silt, washed ashore by winds or currents or eaten by predators, between 5 and 2o the four ripe and one partially spent per cent of those fertilized at 45 female walleyes in their net traps, they degrees should hatch. also picked up many small sunfish 
Predation 

The spawning ground normally will be an area with clear water one to five feet in depth with a rocky bottom and 
The biologists cheeked the stomach either a current or good wave action. contents of the sunfish and found they were full of walleye eggs. 
Walleyes do not build nests. They select spawning areas for depth, water clarity and wave or current action, then, usually at night, several males will accompany a female across the spawning ground. 

Hearings set on game birds 

JOHN PRENTICE of Ingram throws back male walleyes not wanted for research 

T i m e s & t i d e s 

The fact that the Canyon sunfish have been gorging on walleye eggs is an indication that the walleyes have spawned naturally, apparently in good numbers, in the lake. But, since tin' water was warmer than desirable, the hatching success probably will be low. 
Sheldon alligators high, dry 

HOUSTON — Draining of the reser­ voir on the Sheldon Wildlife Manage­ ment Area 2o miles northeast of Hous­ ton for repair to earthen dikes has left sev eral large alligators high and d r \ . 
Some half dozen of the big gators are more than IO feet long and too dan­ gerous to move. 
With concurrence of the U.S. Kish and Wildlife Service, members of the 
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will shoot the larger alligators and donate them to educational and scien­ tific organizations as research and museum specimens* 
“ Many of tin' big alligators original­ ly came to the Sheldon Area from zoos or individuals.” said Ted Clark, parks and Wildlife Department wildlife di­ vision director. “ Consequently, some have lost their fear of man, which makes them even more dangerous." 

AUSTIN — U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service has invited public comment on preliminary hunting regulations for ducks, geese, doves and other migra­ tory game birds. 
Federal proposals include seasons, daily bag limits and shooting hours. 
Officials say no major changes from last year's rules are being proposed. 
Public comments are invited through May 18. They should be ad­ dressed to the Director. U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. Washington, D.C. 
2o24o. 

Two public hearings on the proposals are scheduled for June 21 and Aug. 2 in 
Washington. 

Texas Parks and Wildlife Depart­ ment wildlife officials already have attended m eetings of the Central 
Flyway Council, of which Texas is a member, and made recommendations pertaining lo migratory game bird bunting in the state. 

Dr. Bal Irby, P&WD m igratory game bird urogram director, said the 

 department has asked deletion of federal rules which name specific counties in Texas where white-winged doves may be hunted. 

“ We would like the prerogative to say where whiiew ings may be hunted in Texas," said Irby, “ Of course, most hunting will continue to be limited to the Lower Rio Grande Valley but the possibility might arise in the future for whitewing hunting in areas other than those counties bordering the Rio 
Grande.”

Everett, a muscular junior welter­ weight. had .just lost a unanimous de­ cision to Mamby in the first semifinal of Don King Productions’ Un Hod States 
Boxing 
Champion­ ships Saturday after­ noon at the Convention 
Center Arena. 
A scant turnout of an estimated 2.5oo tuna iind a national television audience watched the Everett- 
Mamby clash as well as two other semifinal bouts. The Arena on­ lookers also saw some 

BRUTON extra attractions, two feature bouts and an exhibition, which were not aired by ABC Sports. 
In the other two tournament matches. Puerto Rican Ruby Ortiz won a unanimous decision over New Je r­ sey’s John Sullivan in a lightweight bout and undefeated Ruben Castillo of 
Bakersfield. Calif, took a decision over 
Sayx ilk* Long Island's Walter Seeley in a battle of world-ranked junior lightweights. 
But the Everett-Mumby bout, also a clash of world-ranked boxers, seemed closer than a unanimous decision as both fighters dominated the ring at points during the match. 
“ It was a tough fight." said Everett with sweat running down his slightly swollen face after the match. “ But I don’t think he won it. T h ey must like 
Mamby down here." 
Everett, of Philadelphia, traded blows with Mamby during the first three rounds, but the New Yorker got to him with a hard left hook and a flurry in the fourth. 
In the fifth. Everett came charging at Mamby on the sound of the bell which opened the round. He had changed to a lelt-handed stance, con­ fusing Mamby

A two-game winning streak in 
The Arena has been replaced by a two-game losing steak on the 
West Coast and Doug Moo knows why. 

The defense didn't make this last trip and Moe figures it belter return in time for Sunday night s encounter vv itll 
Atlanta in Tile Arena 
One reason is that Moe's club has not beaten the Hawks iii three regular season meetings ibis season. Tipoff is 
7:311 p.m. for this uext-to-tlie-last home game of the regular season. 
Before the Spurs left ou this trip. they had defeated Kansas City and 
Washington in The Arena and secured a playoff berth with the victory over the Bullets. 
Now they have consecutive losses at 
Colden State and Los Angeles. 
“ We could have won both games if we'd played any defense and been mentally there." Moe said alter the spurs' 1o7-1112 setback Friday night against the Lakers. 
Tho night before the Splits slipped iii 
Oakland, losing 125-116 to the W ar­ riors. 
“ We were inst mentally somewhere 

 else on this trip.” Moe said. “ Maybe there were too many distractions. I don’t know." 
‘The last two nights the defense has heen awful." Moe continued. "Against 
Los Angeles, ti was atrocious.” 
The Spurs had a particularly good opportunity to stop the Lakers aller 
Karccm Abdul-Jabbar was ejected with .S JH remaining in the game. 
J abba r was charged with a punching foul and received an automatic ejec­ tion after he struck t oby Dietrich whom be though had deliberately thrown the ball at him. 
The Spurs were down, 88-85. when 
Jabbar departed. 

“ We had K are»em out and we couldn’t put them a w ay." Moe re­ sumed. "It was a sure chance to win with Hareem out. . . All they had was 
Caz/ie (Russell) and some (Earl) Ta­ tum scoring. 

S P I R N O TES:

O f THI EXPRESS-NEWS STAff 

Roy Sosa collected three hits and the same number of runs hatted in to spark Pan American to a 7-1 win over Trinity in a round-robin event at Stevens 
Field. 

In the opener, Mando Reyes fired a two-hitter and Bobby Rutledge doubled home the game’s fbnc run as the 
Broncs spoiled Cornell’s debut with a 
1-o win. 
Pinch hitter Mike Gutierrez singled to open the bottom of seventh inning to spoil Bob Dutkov.ski’s no-hit bid as 
Cornell blanked the Tigers, 6-o, in the third game . Hector Rodriguez singled later in the inning for the Tigers’ other hit. Trinity’s record dropped to 11-18. 
Sosa had a RBI single in the fifth inning and a two-run, bases-loaded single in the seventh to back Cliff 
Crowell’s six-hit pitching. Crowell fanned eight and walked two. 
Trinity a\erted a shutout when Jim 
Summerset!, who had two singles. drove home Hector Rodriguez with a one-bagger in the fourth. 
The Tigers blew two opportunities to score in the second and the fourth in­ ning. Karl Theis and John Kaufman led off the second with back-to-back 

 singles. Crowell, however, fanned 
Summerset!, got Rich Squilla on an infield out, and induced Oscar Perez to pop out to end the threat. In the fourth, after Summersett’s blow, Squilla missed a squeeze attempt and John 
Kaufman was caught off third with the game’s potential tying run. 
Jaime Alvarado had a RBI single in the second frame off loser Bill Rous­ seau. and Rick Pena cracked a run- producing double off reliever Darrell 
Dullnig in Pan Ant's four-run. seventh inning. 
Two outstanding catches by right fielder Burt Garcia preserve the 
Broncs’ victory in the first game. With one out and two on in the fifth frame, 
Garcia made a sliding grab of Cor­ nell's Steve Hensler’s low liner to end the threat. In the seventh, Garcia went back to the fence to grab Bob Polera’s deep drive.

No-hitter for Fussell 

By CLIFFORD BRO YLES 

OE THE EXW ESS-NEW S STAIE 
Gary Fussell cut down his stride and the St. Edward's 
Hilltoppers Saturday, fashioning a no-hitter as St. Mary’s swept a 
Big State Conference doubleheader. 
“ I ’ve been struggling,” said Fussell said after he set down the Hilltoppers, 
9-1, in the second game at V.J. Keefe 
Field. “ Coach told me to cut down my stride. X 
“ I ’ve been overstriding and ever­ ything was coming in high.” he said. 
“ I got it down today and threw strikes and that was the difference.” 
Fussell’s performance oversha­ dowed a superb opening game effort by- 
Bob Wagner who allowed only one hit after the second inning in pitching the 
Snakes to a 7-1 victory. 
The twin killing leaves the defending champion Rattlers unbeaten after three starts in the league race. 
Jay 
TJie junior from Jay allowed just four base runners — three of them reaching on Rattler errors — and the lone SEU run scored on a passed ball. 
Fussell said he realized that he had a no-hitter cooking, but addl'd, “ I didn’t 
Realize it was a seven-inning game. I thought I was going to have to pitch nine. 
“ I found out about the fifth inning that we were only going seven and I decided then I had better bear down.” 
Fussell. who is now 2-1 on the year, was starting for only the second time this year. Heretofore, he has been the 
Snakes’ main man in the bullpen. But not anymore. 
“ I decided I'd give Gary a chance to see what he could do in a starting role,” said Coach Elmer Kosub. “ A lot of our pitchers hae have been strugggling and I wanted to see what he could do.” 
Fussell put down 14 batters in a row at one stretch before George Doinidis reached on an error by first baseman 
Marty Zolkoski with two out in the sixth. 
St. Edward’s only run came in the second when Leonard Cinderman walked, took second on a passed ball, moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on a passed ball. 
Wagner walked four batters and loaded the bases in the first two in­ nings before settling down to pitch a four-hitter. 
He got out a first inning jam rather cheaply when only one run could cross the plate after the Hilltoppers loaded the bases with none2 out.

“ The first inning is always a bad one for me,” said Wagner, shaking his head. 
“ I had a lot of success with my changeup today,” he said. “ I had them off balance a lot with it and got several strikeouts.”

. . . sharp 

St. Edward’s contributed eight er­ rors to the Rattler offensive prowess, which if not explosive, was certainly timely. 
Of the 16 St. Mary’s runs, ll of them were unearned. 
The Rattlers jumped out to a 6-1 lead after three innings of the opener as 
Duane Haynes sparked two of the out­ bursts with a double and a triple. 
Nightcap 

In the nightcap, the Snakes scored seven of their runs in the final two innings after Charlie Migl’s bases- loaded triple broke up a 2-1 thriller. 
Rattler support was well distributed. 
Danny Heep drove in four-runs for the day, while Migl and Marty 
Zolkoski, who hit his first home run as a Rattler, drove in three each. 
Paul Szymarek scored four runs and 
Glynn Tschirhart and Migl crossed the plate three each. Haynes, Szymarek and Tschirhart had three hits apiece. 
St. Mary’s, which is now 12-9 on the year, moved into sole possession of first place in the league race since 
Southweste split a doubleheader with 
Texas Lutheran Saturday. The Pirates are now 3-1. 
The Rattlers will play a non-confer­ ence twin bill Sunday at Keefe( against 
Cornell at I p.m. and South Dakota St., immiediately following.

Mystery surrounds 
Randle’s outburst 

Much mystery must surround the thoughts and deeds of Leonard 
Shenoff Randle, the one they call Lenny. Last Monday Mr. Randle became the first major league player in baseball history to slug his manager. To clinch the distinction, he slugged him many times. 
On the surface it seems simple enough. Like the wire services reported, Randle had been demoted from his starting position, he was talking with Texas Manager Frank Lucchesi and he got hot. 
Whack. Then, more whacks. 

One of those things, when the younger man’s radiator boiled over suddenly. 
Randle later said that Lucchesi called him a “ punk” and that turned him on. 
The exact quotation, offered by Randle but later denied by Lucchesi. “ well. what have you got to say, punk?” 

Folks, there’s a whole lot more to it 

 than that. It may or may not all come out in the wash but let’s start at the beginning here today and move matters up to date. This com es after much in­ vestigation, talks with two close-range witnesses who agree, fully, with three others who were close to the scene. 

To begin with, Randle became furious and frustrated a week earlier when he was told that Bump Wills, a rookie, would start at second base for spring games. Randle has owned that Ranger position for three years. 

The first mystery is, why was Randle 

 so shocked at this deciaion? If his brain barrel handles figures at all he must know that when an infielder receives a salary of $8o,ooo and bats just .228 the previous season he’d better have a va­ cuum cleaner for a glove and run like a deer if he expects to keep a firm grip on his job.

HOUSTON (AP) - The 
Rice University defense shined Saturday in the 
Owls’ third scrimmage of spring football practice. 
The defense, headed by 
Tom Adams, Joey Bovill and Don Parrish held the offense at bay most of the practice. 
Adams was credited with three quarterback sacks and was in on se­ veral unassisted tackles as Coach Homer Rice called the scrimmage “ a superior defensive ef­ fort.’’Seven times the defense broke through to sack quarterbacks. 
The offense managed two late touchdowns, one on a 56-yard dash by Guy 
Booker and the other on an 8o-yard pass and run play from quarterback 
Jeff Swab to Joey Di- 
Quinzio. 
Aggies, 
Rice halted 
HOUSTON (AP) - A scheduled 
Southwest 
Conference baseball doubleheader between 
Texas A&M and Rice w as postponed Saturday be­ cause of wet grounds. 
The games were reset for Sunday. 
The Aggies and Owls played four innings of the first game Saturday be­ fore the twin bill was postponned. The Aggies were leading 3-o at the time. 

IN a vin in lead 

KU A LA 
LU M PU R, 
Malaysia 
(A P ) 
— 
Thailand’s Nares Navin maintained a three- stroke lead Saturday with a two-over par 218 on the third day of the $4,ooo 
Dunlop Masters golf championship at the 
Tassek Utara Golf course in Johore Bahru, 17o miles south of here. 

Nevertheless, the shock of being benched by a new, younger man, was too much for Randle. He started to leave camp but several of the older heads persuaded him to stay. 
When word of the near-departure reached Manager Lucchesi his pipes got warm. “ Sorry to hear that the veterans stopped him,” Frank said. Then, warming to his subject, he added, “ I ’m sick and tired of these punk athletes pulling down salaries of $8o,ooo and then crying and running anytime the manager benches them.” The key word, it seems, was “ punk.” 
Surprise attack 
Now we come to the meat of the matter, the punches. 
Four days after that exchange of words Randle met his 49-year-old manager on the practice field, near the third base line. Lucchesi, still in street clothes, was on his way to the dugout to change. Randle was in uniform. 

Here’s the part of the story that has been poorly reported. Randle would have 

 people believe that he just sashayed up to the manager for some quiet conver­ sation and was immediately insulted. Not so. The two men talked calmly for the better part of four minutes. Lowest estimate in that area is “ about two or three minutes” while the highest is “ maybe five minutes.” Voices were never raised. 
At least six eye and ear witnesses no more than 39 feet away agree on that. 

Both men had their hands on their hips but not in a defiant way. More like most baseball men stand, with hands in back pockets, when not much is happening on the field. 

But suddenly, without the slightest warning and with amazing speed, Ran­ dle’s right crashed into Luechesi’s head. There was no wind-up, no draw-back.. 
The m anager began failing slowing, shifting to his right as if turned by the force of the blow. Then came a left with equal force and speed, the blow that probably shattered Fran k’s cheekbone in three places. The Ranger manager fell to the ground, landing hard on his right hip. The player swarmed over him and threw at least three more punches—perhaps four—but nobody is now sure whether any of those last blows landed. 

It was Bert Campaneris. frozen at. first, by surprise and the swiftness of it all. who finally took four strides and leaped over the fallen Lucchesi and stretched his hands, palms up, to fend off Randle. Lenny wasn’t easy to restrain. “ Leave me alone,” he screamed as more players rushed to the scene. 
Reports differ a bit during that wild moment because there was a lot of shoving and pushing but after a minute Randle was pulled away and some order was restored. 
The bat rack 
Now here’s the rest of it, parts that wire services missed. 

As players and trainers helped carry Lucchesi to the dugout tunnel Randle 

 followed the parade but then whirled and grabbed a bat from the rack. He held the stick briefly, in a challenging manner, but then dropped it and trotted to the outfield where he began to run wind sprints—all alone. 

Emotions ran wild among players for the next few minutes and at least one. 
Ken Henderson, had to be restrained from chasing after Randle. The sight of 
'Lucchesi, out cold with blood trickling from his mouth and his right eye closing fast, was too much for some. 
As fate would have it, the fact that Randle is black and Lucchesi is white draws special no­ tice from some and dif­ ferent meaning for others. 

But it must be rem em ­ bered that Bum p Wills, the youngster who is re­ p lacin g R an d le at s e ­ cond, is also black. He’s the son of the g re a t b a s e -s te a le r , 
M aury 

W ills. 
Also 
R a n d le ’ s 

 frustration might go far beyond anything Lucche­ si said on that Monday afternoon. It could go ail the way back to the col­ lege days of Randle and 
Wills. I haven’t yet seen this in print anywhere but both m en played baseball at Arizona State. 

The most amazing part of the whole, sick affair, however, is Randle’s at­ titude today and the de­ cision of the players’ as­ sociation to help him in his protest against his suspension by the 
Rangers. 
If the players’ union continues to assiet Ran­ dle and he wins his case for re-instatement suf­ fering any major fine or punishment then base­ ball might as well get rid of all its umpires because no future decisions on fair play or justice will again be needed or want­ ed.

Beadle moans at driver costs 

Big-narne drag racing at spe­ cial m ee ts for local tracks across the country will be a thing of the past in a few years, funny car driver/ow ner Ray­ mond Beadle believes. 
B e ad le sa y s the s o a rin g co sts of o p e ra tin g funny c a r s and top fuel d ra g s te rs will prevent sm all tra c k s from being able to afford them and that they will perform mostly at m ajor national events. 
The Lubbock native says the costs of m aintaining his Blue Max. which he has been cam paigning since 1974. are u n b e lie v a b le , a lth o u g h h e ’s n ev e r grossed less than $2oo.1)oo since he started racing funnys in 1971. 
Beadle was in San Antonio over the weekend for a special grudge race with top fueler Shirley Muldowney at Alamo 
Dragway. 
“ Some women who enter drag rac­ ing are just there and you . wouldn’t even notice them if they w eren't wo­ m en ." he says with a distinct Texas 

 drawl. 
But Beadle, one of the nation's most highly reg a rd e d funny ca r d riv e rs. holds a deep respect for Muldowney. 
The 13-year drag racing veteran says the races are not as exciting for him now as when he first began. 
“ It depends on who your opponent is 
— I get geared up when I race Don 
P r u d h o m m e , who is m y only re a l ch allen g er in funny cars, and I get geared up when I race Muldowney." 
B ead le’s Blue Max was revam ped for 1977 with partner Harry Schmidt, and they are hoping it will win them more national events as it has in the past. 
“ I’m really glad about the last few years because I ’ve had som e really good help,” Beadle says now that he ranks am ong the best in racing. 
“ I didn’t think I would do this well at first; I didn’t feel that I could devote as much tim e as you have to." 
But since he has done so well, he wants to keep the pedal to the metal for m any m ore years. — JOHN GOOD­

She loves danger 

SHIRLEY MULDOWNEY 

. . . liberated 

By JOHN GOODSPEED 
Blue-orange flames leap just a few inches from a lovely lady’s head w h ile a d e a fen in g roar drowns out everything. 

She's strapped into a m achine that's about to rocket to 25o m .p.h. in six seconds. 
But she’s not the victim of a cruel m a d m an in a scien cefictio n h o rro r movie. The wom an is just doing the everyday job that she loves. 
She is Shirley Muldowney, the fas­ test woman in drag racing, and one of the best top fuel dragster drivers in the world. 
Muldowney’s profession transcends the traditional sexual roles. She is just an o th er speed a d d ic t in th e m ach o world of d rag racing, yet Muldowney retains her feminity with a style most women would envy. 
At first g lan ce , th e tall, sle n d er, brown-eyed brunette could be a high- fashion model or an actress. 
But u n d e r n e a th th e b e a u ty an d charm is a womoan who has m ore guts 

 and d e t e r m in a tio n th an an y m a le chauvinist could hopeo have. 
And it takes plenty of guts to get into a machine and unleash 2,5oo horses in a m ad, qu arter-m ile dash w here the slightest m istake could result in dis­ aster. 

“ I like to think I’m a liberated wo­ man — I m ake enough to stay finan­ cially liberated, but I’m dependent on men to work on my c a r ," says Mul­ downey, who has a pit crew of three with 
Connie Kallitta as head wrench. 
“ Racing was something I thought I had to do, but if s especially hard for a wom an because w om en are not m e­ chanically inclined. 

“ I always worked hard, and I should have been discouraged m any tim es. but I w asn’t ,” she says of her 19-year career which began the sam e way as her m ale c o u n terp arts with a street racer. 

She has come a long was since she began whizzing down the strips at 18 in 
Schenectady, N Y .. and has gathered a big following of women. 

Her long list of c re d e n tia ls she show why b ea tin g h er is so m e th in g special: 
Muldowney is the first woman d rag ­ ster driver (a gasser in 1965). the first woman to win a m ajor funny ca r title, the first woman to drive a funny car in the six-second range, the first woman to run faster than 2oo m .p.h. in the quarter mile and the only w om an li­ censed to drive a top fuel dragster. 
She had a string of M IRA national meet victories in 1976, won the M IRA 
YVinternationals in 1977 and won the 
1977 National P R O. race with her best time ever of 5.79 seconds at 252.1o in the quarter mile. 
“ Big Daddy” Don Garlitts holds the top fuel record with a 5.63 at Ontario 
Speedway in 1975. 
But Muldowney m aintains she is the 
No. I top fuel dragster driver. 

“ I think I’ll always be in racing in some form or another. I d on’t know when I ’ll quit driving, but ITI know when i f s tim e.’" 
F or now, sh e lives for th a t green light and enjoys being the fastest wo­ man alive. 
T rinity netters prevail 

By KEVIN O’KEEFFE 
OF THE EXPRESS NEW S STAFF 

Trinity reduced Alabama’s Crimson Tide to a mere ripple Saturday afternoon, win­ ning a 8-1 dual tennis match at the Trinity 
Tennis Stadium. 

A capacity crowd of more than 6oo filled the sta­ dium as the Tigers had little trouble, save for a few matches, dism antling Alabama for the second time this year. TU defeated Alabama, 7-2, in the season- opening m atch at the National Team Championships in Wisconsin. 
Larry Gottfried captured the num ber one singles m atch ag a in st Jeff R obinson, 6-4. 6-4; E rick Is- kersky, who is the hottest Trinity netter at this point in the year, needed just 5o m inutes to defeat Bob 
Belier, 6-2. 6-o, in the num ber two singles. 
Ben McKown struggled to take the num ber three m atch over R obert .Johnson, 5-7. 6-2, 6-3; Tony 
G iam m alv a downed Mike Shore. 6-3, 6-3; E ddie 
Reese edged Chip W ade. 7-6. 2-6, 6-1; and Dave 
Benson whipped Maurice Crowe, 7-6, 6-4. Mike Da­ vidson knocked off Mike O’Leary, 6-2, 6-1, in a m atch which did not figure in the scoring. 
Doubles 
In doubles, G iam m alva and Gottfried looked sharp in the num ber one m atch and defeated Robinson and 
Chip Wade, 6-4, 6-2; McKown and Neal Wade topped 
Johnson and Crowe in the num ber three doubles. 7-5, 
6-2; but Deller and Shore won the num ber two dou­ bles m atch for the Tide, ousting Benson and Reese, 
7-5. 7-5. 
G ottfried, one of T rin ity ’s four freshm en, used some excellent passing shots to down his taller foe. 
"H e (Robinson) is really good at the net,” Gott­ fried said. "So, I was really lucky that my passing shot was working so well today. "I knew if I did not pass him that he would have a great m any easy volleys at the net. His serve is so strong that he gets a lot of those. 
“ In the beginning of the match. I tried to lob him a lot, but he hurt me with some of his overheads.” 
“ Larry did not play his best because he was a little tight.” Trinity Coach Bobby McKinley said. “ But he concentrated well on the big points. He played sm a rt tennis. That Robinson is tough. He beat Tony earlier this year and defeated Bill Scallion (TU All-Ameri­ can and NCAA singles cham p in 1976) last y ea r.’’ 
Both Gottfried and Robinson held serve until the seventh g am e of the first set when Gottfried broke. 
He hit two great passing shots to win the game. Both men held serve and Gottfried took the set. 
Robinson 
Robinson, who cam e to net consistently behind his serve, was broken twice in in the second set. The curly-haired Alabama netter saved two m atch points in the ninth gam e of the second set and saved a third in the 1oth gam e before Gottfried clinched it. 
“ I should have com e in m ore towards the end," 
Gottfried adm itted. “ I was letting it come to m e.” 
Iskersky, a finalist at the Rice Invitational last month, and G iam m alva. who has experienced some confidence problem s lately, were singled out for praise by their coach. 
“ T hat Erick is really so­ m ething," McKinley'said of the Toledo. Ohio frosh. 
“ And Tony (another freshm an) played the best he has in quite a while. He is hitting groundstokes better and when that works, lie has confidence.” 
McKown, after splitting sets with Johnson, was down o-3 in the third. He cam e to life then, winning six straight gam es to clinch the match. He. too, was aided by some deft passing shots. 
“ Ben did not really play that well at all,” McKin­ ley said. " B u t he gutted it up and worked hard, playing with a great deal of intensity.”

 fifth-round XKO over Coapad Salinas that served as a w armup for his May 14 title bout against world champion

"M y combinations were working." he explained. “ I got really hit just once. with a left uppercut in the second round." 
Saldivar 
The fight was Saldivar’s first since a 
1o-round verdict over Mario Bossa last 
Nov. 4 in Los Angeles. He is now 27-1.

 anger in his eyes. Seconds later an­ other right hook from Everett stag­ gered Mam by. The nill th-ranked 
Everett clearly won the round. 
The Philadelphian charged out quickly in the next two rounds and scored heavily, but Mainby staggered him in the sixth with a straight right. 
Everett fought the rest of the fight from his southpaw stance. 
Southpaw 
“ I went southpaw and for five rounds he couldn't touch me,’’ Everett em­ phasized. “ All he threw was one good punch (the right). His ear is all cut up. 
He ll probably have to go to the hospi­ tal. 
“ Philadelphia can't get a (bleeping) decision when boxing away from home," Everett concluded. 
Everett’a brother, Tyrone, the top world contender in the junior lightweight class, who was working the corner complained about the judges actions at fight's end. 

“ I saw some erasing on those scorecards,” Tyrone said angrily. 
“ Why did it take so long to get a decision? You know something’s wrong. They (the judges) heard the crowd shouting for Mamby and started changing the scorecards." 
Mamby merely attributed his victory to conditioning. "I was iii shape, that's why I won," lie said. "I was in good physical condition and good mental condition after a six-month layoff." 
Class 
In the other match which had world class fighters, Castillo, now 23-o. overcame the confusion of fighting southpaw Seeley in the early rounds, to come on strong with a knockdown in the ninth. 
In the first three rounds Seeley landed more punches, mostly hooks, but from the fourth through the end, 
Castillo was sharp and precise w ith his shots. 
After controlling the match for five rounds, Castillo unraveled a blurry left-right. left-right combination in the 

 ninth, followed by a hook and a straight right and Seeley tumbled on the King Productions' emblem in the middle of the canvas. 
Castillo held off a desparate charge by Seeley in the l oth, cutting the 
Irishman's left eye with a hard hook. 
“ It confused me." Castillo said,in reference to boxing a left-hander. “ I vc got to get used to it. That’s the first southpaw I ’ve fought since I was ll. 
In the extra attractionas. Vicente 
Saldivar, who has signed to meet 
World Champion Esteban DeJesusin a title bout on May 14, TKO’d ( oapad 
Salinas at 2:31 of the fifth round in a scheduled eight-rounder and a new heavyweight prospect Kandy Cobb won a first-round TKC) over Trinidad Es­ camilla, knocking him down three times before the action was halted.

The only hit off Blyleven was Enos

Sneva wins Prix 

Continued from Page while Houston's A.J. Foyt dropped to second. 
Sneva, USAC champ car rookie of the year in the 
1973, held off Unser the final three laps of the race, which was slowed by five yellow flags to an unoffi­ cial average speed of 156.97 miles per hour. 
Sneva, whose only other championship victory was the Michigan 15o in 1975. started in the number eight position in the 19-car field but had battled his way into third place on the 59th lap when early leader 
Foyt left the race with a broken radiator. 
Unser, a former Indianapolis 5oo winner, took the lead briefly when the final green flag dropped on the 
96th lap but Sneva regained the lead on the second turn and never trailed again. 
Wally Dallenbaeh of Basalt, Colo., finished third despite receiving a black flag on the 73rd lap for passing during a yellow flag. 
A victory for Unser w ould have tied him for second place on the USAC all-time championship car vic­ tory list with Mario Andretti, Nazareth, Pa. 
Gordon Johncock, Phoenix, Ariz., and Johnny 
Rutherford, Fort Worth. Tex., drew the front row positions in the race but Foyt quickly took the lead in the early laps and ran strongly until his mechanical problems on the 59th lap. 
Foyt and Dallenbaeh provided the most excite­ ment during the 1oo-lap race with a neek-and-neek duel on the 35th though 44th laps when they ran one and two. Foyt eventually kept the lead. 
4oo points 
Sneva’s victory was worth $13,179 and 4oo points in the USAC championship ear standings. 
The field averaged 197.293 mph over the first 2o laps before the procession of yellow flags reduced the speeds and cut the field to only eight ears by the finish of the race. By race's end 25 laps had been run under the yellow flag.

Track records fall 

Jay ’s phenomenal m iler Mark Anderson and 
Marshall’s high-stepping hurdler Randy Clay as­ saulted city records Saturday afternoon at the 
Alamo Relays at Northside Stadium. 
Anderson, the top miler in the state, smashed a 
4:12.8 mark, which he set in 1976, with a 4:1o.77 effort. Anderson is moving ever closer to the state schoolboy mark. 
Clay, who ranks among the state’s top IO in both hurdle events, erased a mark that has stood s inee 
1947, by running a 13.95 in the 12o-yard highs. 
The old mark of 14.o was set by Burbank’s Lee 
Miller and has been tied four times. 
Rockets w in 
HOUSTON 
- 
The 
Houston 
Rockets trounced the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, 1o6*93. in NBA play Saturday night. 
The victory gives 
Houston a three-gam e lead over second-plaece 
Washington in the Cen­ tral Division standings. 
Any com bination of 
Rocket victories or Wa­ shington defeats totaling two will give Houston the 
Central Division title. 

No one is particularly anxious to discuss the possibility and, admittedly, the chances of it happening are slim, but what happens if Chicken Little is right? 

What happens if during the renova­ tion of the Arena, the roof caves in? 
For the Spurs, that would be as bad as the sky falling in. 
“Yes, I’ve thought about that possi­ b ility ,” says Spurs owner Angelo 
Drossos, “ and, yes. we’d be in a lot of trouble. 

“ I suppose the first thing we’d try to do is reach an agreement with North 
East to play at Blossom A thletic 
Center. It holds about 5,o9o (4.9oo), so at least we could get most of our season tieketholders in.’’ 

What about Joe Freeman Coliseum? 
“That could hold may be 7,ooo,” says 
Drossos. “but it doesn't have any air conditioning, and that could create a problem, especially at the start of the season. 
“ I can’t see the team moving out of 
San Antonio on an interim basis. If it moves, it would be moving perm an­ ently. I d certainly like to see us play some games in Austin when the Uni­ versity of Texas gets their new gym built, at least some exhibitions.” 

Tom Noonan, the architect who is overseeing the raising of the roof, says the chance- of something going wrong 
“ is the most remote thing in the world. 
It would have to be a combination of mechanical and human error. We’ll be taking all sorts of safeguards. 

“The roof will be lifted 33 feet, and it will be one of the last things we do. 
Before we do that, we’ll have all the materials at hand. Also, the raising of the roof will be done autom atically, and at inches at a time, so if something wasn’t right, we could stop immedia­ tely. 

“ Also, the fact that hard headed in­ surance companies were convinced it is safe says something, too.” The pro­ ject is insured for a total of $16 million. 

“The same thing was done with Me­ morial Auditorium in Buffalo,” says 
Noonan. “ Everything went well there. 
The possibility that would worry me most would be if there was a strike and the steel wasn't delivered.” 
Two summers hence, when the roof is scheduled to be raised , Angelo 

Drossos’ fondest desires will be for tranquility in the steel industry and still winds. 
Notes and quotes 
If you don’t believe injuries have hurt Phoenix more than any other team , consider the fact Suns Coach 
John MacLeoad recently used his Pith different starting lineup of the season against Seattle, and it included three rookies, Ron Lee, Ira T errell and 
Butch Feller... 

 lf the Detroit P istons make the 
Western Conference playoffs, which they will accomplish barring a total collapse, they will be the only team in the West to make it for the last four seasons. 

Their 42-34 record is really amazing when you consider the Pistons’ nu­ merous injuries as well as their maxi­ mum security-type of morale. Detroit is 5-6 since center Bob Lanier went out with a hand injury. . . . 

As San Antonio’s first NBA season winds down, it has become obvious the 
Seattle Coliseum has two of the most unique features of any league arena. 
F’irst. its game horn can be heard by the residents in downtown Caracas, 
Venezuela. Arid its locker rooms are located closer to Santa Fe than the playing floor.. . . 

Spurs Coach Dong Moe estimates he has worn his brown sport coat to the last 27 games away from the Conven­ tion Center Arena. Why? “ Because,” says Moe, an avowed casual dresser, 
“ it’s indestructible.” . . . 

While Buffalo’s Adrian Dantley, a 
19-point scorer, is considered a heavy favorite for NBA Rookie of the Year honors, Philadelphia guard Henry 
Bibby would like to cast a vote for his 
Houston colleague. John Lucas. 

“ I think he is contributing more to his team than any other rookie, simply because of where his team is in the standings.” says Bibby. 

“ Dantley is having a good year, but look where Buffalo is. Lee is having a good year, but look where Phoenix is. 
Scott May (Chicago) and Richard Wa­ shington (Kansas City) are playing well and their teams are doing okay, but in my opinion, neither has had the impact on their team that Lucas has had.” 

Since the award is for the “ NBA 
Rookie of the Year,” here is a vote for 
George Gervin. . . .

Billie Jean 
' T1GER T!ffOR duels Evert 

By Bob Dale 

HILTON HEAD ISI AND, SC . (AP) 
— Chris Evert will go up against an old adversary. Billie Jean King, for the first tim e in nearly two years in the finals Sunday of the w om en’s tennis tournam ent after both won se m in a l m atches. 
On S a tu rd a y . Ms. K ing d efeated 
^ K erry Reid 6-3, 7-6 and M iss Evert downed Mima Jausovee of Yugoslavia 
6-3, 6-4. 
T he two te n n is s ta rs last m et in to u rn a m e n t play w hen Ms. K ing defeated the young Floridian 2-6, 6-2, 
6-3 in th e se m ifin a ls of th e 1975 
Wimbledon. 
Ms. King said she didn't expect to get as far in the to u rn am en t being played at Sea Pines Racquet Club. 
“ I thought I had no chance of getting to the finals. Why should I? I haven’t 

 played a to u rn a m e n t in seven m onths.” 
Ms. King, who u n d erw en t m ajo r knee surgery last fall, looked as though she had lost little of her power, deli­ vering boom ing serves, volleys and overhead sm ashes to elim inate Mrs. 
Reid. 
“ I'm still not tournam ent tough at all.” the 33-year-old Ms. King said. 
‘ I’m in shape, but not mental shape.” 
The v e te ra n said she su ffe re d a mental lapse in the ninth gam e of the second set when she lost two m atch points. Mrs. Reid, an Australian now living in Greenville, S.C., cam e back to tie the match and force Ms. King into a nine-point tie-breaker, which the Cali­ fornian won 53. 
Ms. King said she was not anxious to go a th ird set.

Jones sets world record 

AUSTIN (A P) - Olympian 
Johnny Jones, exploding from the blocks like a rocket, blazed to a 
9.85 clocking in the 
1oo-meter dash Saturday at the 
Texas Relays but was denied a possible world record because the electronic timer m alfunc­ tioned. 

Jones, a freshman at the University of Texas and a m ember of the U.S. gold medal sprint relay team at Montreal last sum m er, had only a four mile an hour wind at his hack as he got off to a tremendous start. 
Only last sum m er the international track and field federation voted that hand-held w atches would not be a l­ lowable for world records in races of 
IOO m eters. Three hand-held watches 

 caught Jones in 9.94. 9.85 and 9.8. 
The world record of 9.95 was estab­ lished by Jim H ines of the U nited 
States in 1968. 
Jones ran the brilliant race despite confusion as just to where the finish line was. 
“ I couldn’t see the tape so I didn’t know w here to sto p ...so I ju st kept running,” said Jones. 
The nam e of the tim er that malfun- 

R E S E L L S , C a p o OS 

Honed is A ecu-traek. The c a m eras worked on the race but the electrical time failed to register. 
The sun-splashed crowd of 15,ooo in 
Memorial Stadium gave a trem endous roar when the time was announced but it turned to groans of dismay when the malfunction was disclosed. 
The classy Jones, a starting halfback on the Texas football team , whipped an 

 invitational field that included Olym­ pian Dwayne E vans of Arizona who was a bronze m e d a list in the 
2oo-meters at Montreal. 
Bill Collins, a form er Texas C hris­ tian sprinter w as second at 1o.16. 
The hometown crowd greeted Jones with a standing ovation when he was introduced before the race and Texas athletic D irector D arrell Royal, who had never seen Jones race, said “ You don’t think that doesn’t put a little pressure on him .” 
Alter the Lam pasas. Tex., sprinter led from wire to wire. Royal sm iled and said, “ It was just strictly good-bye starter, hello judge.” 
In o th e r T exas R elays re c o rd s, 
Henry M arsh of Brigham Young com­ pleted the g ru e lin g 3,ooo-m eter steeplechase in record tim e of 8:27.7. 
The old record of 8:42.3 was set by Kent 
McDonald of Kansas in 1975. 
Jerom e Hutchins of the University of 

Texas-El Paso also established a re­ cord in the triple jum p with an effort of 
53 feet nine inches.

 tour this year, credited tip s from his younger brother Dave, a junior at 
O klahom a S ta te , w ith drastic im provem ent in his gam e this year. 
“ H e’s helped m e a lot,” said Edwards, who has finished 2oth or bet­ ter in eight of nine starts this season. “ I’m better in every phase of the game from tee to green. 
Pm hitting the ball more solid, driving longer, hit­ ting my irons better. The only thing that’s keeping m e from p u ttin g four good rounds together is my short gam e.” 
That problem wasn’t in evidence as he left Nel­ son and the dangerous 
Irwin — who had shared the lead at the start of the cool, windy, drizzly day 
— well behind. 
The slightly-built Nel­ son matched par 72 in the difficult winds and was tied for second at 2o8 with big George Burns, who moved up with a o8. 
All th ree leaders are seeking their first title, a 

 victory that will put the w in n er in next w eek ’s prestigious M asters and the 
T o u rn a m e n t of 
Champions the following week. 
Irw in, a fo rm er U.S. 
Open champion and one of the gam e’s most high­ ly com petitive players, encountered a balky put­ te r and dropped five strokes back at 2o9 after a 73. 
Only those four m en appeared to have a shot at the $47,ooo first prize in Sunday’s final round. 
It was three more strokes back to the group tied at 
212, five strokes behind 
Edwards. They included 
Andy Bean, who had a th ird round o9, G rie r 
Jonw es, 7o, Rik M as­ sengale, 74, and Dr. Oil 
Morgan, 71. 
Al G eiberger, who is d efending his title d e­ sp ite the d eath of his lather early this week in the crash of two jets in the Canary Islands, had a 
7o-213 and appeared cer­ tain to becom e the 

 g am e’s 13th $1 m illion career winner. He needs only $835 lo make it, and, in a tie for ninth after three rounds, would have to shoot a very high num ber Sunday to miss. 
“ W ith the w inds like they were, sw irling and changing directions, that 

 was a phenomenal round 
Danny sh o t,” said Nel­ son, a late-bloom ing 
29-year-qld who d id n ’t take up the gam e until he was 22. 

“ I’m happy with a 72. 
And I’m happy w e’re playing this course.

SABA entries down 

Danny Errico came within a wiggle of recording his second 3oo game in six months. 
Errico strung out ll straight strikes before leaving a shaking five pin for a 299 game Thursday night in the Commercial League at Wonder Bowl. The big game was en route to an 8o9 series — the first 8oo this season. 
Meanwhile, Red Holland reported that entries for this year’s San 
Antonio Bowling Association’s men’s city tournament are down from last year. 

“ I crossed o v er." said Errico, who had gam es of 279 and 231 before his near-m iss. ‘i t was my last ball. I went to the foul lin e , and the ball ju st jumped off my hand and goes Brook­ lyn. The IO pin looked like it wanted to stand but it eventually fell. Despite all the ch e erin g and noise in the b ack ­ g ro u n d . th e five pin w iggled but wouldn’t fall.” 
Errico, 2o, who rolled the city’s only sanctioned perfect game this season back in November, had an 8oo series as a 16-year old junior bowler at Wonder 
Bowl. 
‘i ’m really thrilled," Errico said. “ I knew I needed a 29o or better for an 
SOO. I hadn't gotten an eight since I was a junior, and I wanted one in the ABC r a n k s . All the b a lls w ere in the pocket—-except the last one. I'm hav­ ing a pretty good year so far." 
E r r ic o , an ABC m e m b er for ju st over a year, has won an Alamo Tour­ n a m e n t A sso ciatio n event and a 
Southeast Classic Bowling Association tournament since August. 
T h e city to u rn am en t b eg in s its four-weekend run April 23-24. with the singles and doubles at Sports Palace, and the team event Wonder Bowl. 
“ We have 
297 e n trie s in the tournament for team, doubles and sin­ gles events." said Holland, the SABA secretary. “ We’re a little down from last year. We had just over 3oo entries in 1976. The problems with the entries seem to be the ABC tournam ent in 
R eno and the s ta te to u rn am en t in 
Midland and Odessa. A few folks can’t find time to schedule all tnree events. 
“ We haven't had any problems in getting the tournament situated. How­ ever. we are going to have a few short shifts. There are very few signed up for the 9:3o a.rn. shifts—bowlers don’t like to bowl in the mornings. The late shifts are filled up." 

Braniff flies high 

The Braniff International team of 
San Antonio took the Class A Open Di­ vision team lead in the 4oth annual 
Texas W om en’s Bowling Association meet in Amarillo. 
The Braniff squad rolled 2.457. Barr 
Iron & Metal of Alice is second at *2.428 and Rogers’ Truck & Repair of Am ar­ illo is third at 2.354. 
Judy Burkhardt had a 59o series. 
Camelia Moon 
532, 
Judy Brinkley 
483, 
Susan Schoenfeld 
438 and 
Pat 
Spradling 432 to account for B r a n iffs scoring. 
“ Most of us, except Camilla, didn t do that well in singles and doubles, so, when the team event cam e around, we figured what the h e c k ." Burkhardt said. “ We bowled pretty good. There was a gold shot inside. It was kind of funny, everybody was bowling bad in the Open Division and my 523 in sin­ gles was in second place until the next day. I hope our team score stays up there." 
Teresa Rook of San Antonio is in second place in Class D Open Division singles with a 518. Debbie Riley of Fort 
Worth is in first place with a 587. 
In the Men’s State Tournament in 
Midland and Odessa. W ayne's Shirt 
Shop continues to lead Class B team with a 2,8o7 and Free & Easy is still the 
( lass D team leader with a 2.6o9. G ar­ za Finance continues in third place in 
(’lass C team and Guess Towel remains in the same position in Class D team. 
Avery Faile dropped to second place in Class D singles. W ill Bahner of El 
Paso took over the lead with a 6o3. 
Faile has a 576. Wayne Delfosse and 
Bane Walden dropped from a tie for second place to a deadlock for third place in Class C Doubles.

Morton / Southwest prices homes right 

A now home, priced and sized just right for you and your family, surely awaits you this weekend in one of the recent Morton / South­ west communities. 
The highly successful building - developing firm's two most recent series of housing are drawn from clever floor plans which have revolutionized the market for new homes here by making them more affordable and useful, square foot by square foot. 
Modeled 

Freedom Homes and Success Homes are modeled in Lakeside, located in southeastern 
Bexar County off U.S. Hwy. 87 outside S.E. 
Loop 41o; Valley Forge, off O’Connor Road between Nacogdoches Road and N.E. HI 35; and Cimarron, just south of N E. F'M 16o4 east of Kitty Hawk Drive. 
Success Homes also are shown in a recent addition to the long established Valencia 

 community, off Nacogdoches Road north of its intersection with Perrin-Beitel Road. 
The two series are aptly named. 
Freedom Homes are called that because they, literally, set buyers “ free from rent” and put them into a whole new world of home ownership. Success Homes are named after the series’ outstanding features that would make the purchase of any a sure success. 
“ Affordable” is a key word for each series. 
Freedom Homes are priced from as low as 
S28.5oo; Success, $34,ooo. No comparable homes are built for those kind of prices these days; so, Morton / Southwest has a valid claim to leadership in San Antonio area housing. 
Freedom Homes go far beyond the basics, despite their low price range. They feature all the frill modern families expect in a new home, which accounts for just one of the many reasons the series has become so po- 

MORTON/ SOUTHWEST innovates desireable, affordable homes 

Freedom Homes feature three- and four- bedroom plans with two complete baths. 
Morton / Southwest made sure to offer ample extras among their nine floor plans, making each an attractively affordable package. 
Success Homes vividly reveal that an en­ joyable home remains the great American dream that still can be realized without great sacrifices on the parts of buyers. 
The scope of Success Homes, however, goes far beyond their useful space. Their luxury appointments add much to how they present more than the money’s worth. 
Lakeside is a neighborhood unique in its 

 recreational offerings. They include a lake for boating or fishing, tennis courts, swimming pool and park area. The community is within the East Central School District. 

Valley Forge, also boasting a swimming pool and tennis courts, is in the North East 
School District. 

Cimarron, with access to a number of amenities like a swim club. Scout hut and playground, is in the Judson School District. 
Valencia offers a clubhouse, swimming pool and tennis courts. It, too, is in the North 
East School District.

We Build The 
“New’’Into Your 
New Home 
To Stay. 

Unlike a lot of builders, 
M orton/Southwest is concerned with more than just a sold sign in a front yard. That means giving every new home owner confidence in his purchase. 
W e do that by starting with a w ell-built home in a w ell-planned neighborhood. 
That means you can live in a home designed to give you the absolute maximum of usable living space for the dollar in a comfortable and fun community close to where you work and shop. 

All that means value. All that means m oney’s worth.

SCHAEFER models decorated to please 
Schaefer chose three top areas 

I f s the unexpected, the little extras that go into each Schaefer home that elicit the “ ooh’s and ah’s ” and, perhaps, convince many along the way that, although homes aren ’t built like they used to be, they can be even better. 
While more and more builders have cut down their 

 building p rogram s and stripped down their pro­ ducts, Schaefer is building a quality home in proven neighborhoods, with hidden values, luxurious extras 
-and energy-saving features — all at an affordable price and special financing, 
Concern for individual 
Tasteful individuality, quality craftsm anship and lasting value distinguish Sch aefer’s philosophy of personal concern for the individual homebuyer. 
I f s Sch aefer’s style to add a little style to its homes. Schaefer homes boast such exciting features as garden atriu m s, sunken living a re as, vaulted ceilings, fireplaces and even lofts that can double as an extra bedroom, study or hobby center. 
Schaefer is out to prove luxury features need not be lim ited to luxury priced homes. You can still find quality built homes with luxury features at a price you can affo rd . T h ese hom es have g la m o ro u s country kitchens, space-saving bonus rooms, formal living and dining a re as and even separate gam e rooms or a study for the kids. Even Schaefer kit­ chens are every bit as glam orous as they are func­ tional. 
Designed with imagination and flair, there seem s to be no tolerance for the dull. Countertops range from chopping block to colorful form ica, and there are extra touches like niches for displaying favorite pieces of china and elongated breakfast bars for space-saving dining. 
- - 
Schaefer kitchens come equipped with top - of - the line G E appliances, including self-cleaning ovens that m ake cooking and clean-up a breeze. 
The quality workm anship is evident throughout any Schaefer home: the hand-laid ceram ic tile, the colonial h an dcrafted m oldin g (not stain ed , but painted), the m arble vanities, the abundant wall fabric, the handle sets on doors and the furniture- finished cabinetry. All extra Schaefer features make your home look better, last longer and m ake you proud to call it your own. 
There is more as energy-saving features. Each home has a custom-engineered, high-efficiency cen­ tral air and heat sy stem ; sp ecial duct work for optim al air flow; 3l?2-inch insulation between the walls; and six through eight inches of blown insula­ tion in the a ttic . In fa c t, th ere is e x tra a ttic ventilation, and all windows are designed to m ini­ mize air infiltration and m axim ize light and views. 
All of these add up to the Schaefer concept: “ We’re building homes you’ll want to come home to.” Qua­ lity built, affordably priced homes show an astounding amount of imagination and forethought on the part of the builder. 
Schaefer homes in Northern Hills are priced from 
$37,ooo to $7o,ooo. In Devonshire, Schaefer homes are av ailab le from $37,ooo to $55,ooo; L ak esid e, 
$3o,ooo to $5o,ooo. 
All neighborhoods are developed with consistency and are located near schools (the preferred North 
East and E ast Central School D istricts) and shop­ ping centers to assure buyers of a sound investment. 
Schaefer models are open from IO a.m . until dusk. 
Financing is the best VA, EHA or conventional in town. The homes are everything you should expect for what you’re going to spend

Gary pools win award 

Two swim ming pools built by Gary Pools Inc., Ill 
N.E. Loop 41o, won aw ards in the annual interna­ tional design contest sponsored by the National 
Sw imming Pool Institute, it has been announced by 
Leif /a r s. G a ry president. 
“ This is prestigious achievem ent,’’ Zars pointed out, “ when it is considered that there were 48o entries from throughout the world from 125 com­ pan ies and G ary captured two of the 6o aw ards presented." 
Only four Texas pools won recognition, and Gary entered half of them. The Gary pools were the only ones from this part of Texas to receive aw ards, Zars em phasized. 
Zars, who is past president of the Texas chapter of the institute, said the contest results were a tribute not only to Gary engineers but also to the technicians and construction crew s who worked on the prize­ winning pools. 
Gary Pools, which also has offices in Austin and 
Dulls, have won sim ilar aw ards in other years, but 
Zars believes this year’s results are more significant because of the intensity of competition. 
The G ary award winners were a concrete resi­ dential pool at the home of a prominent North Side businessm an and a community pool, 56- by 56-feet, at Green Spring Valley subdivision on W etmore

‘New world’ found in Thousand Oaks 

Highlight of Timber 
Ridge this weekend is the northwestern 
Bexar 
County neighborhood’s tennis and swim club. 
The junior olympic and twin tennis facilities are a real asset to the Timber 
Ridge community. 
Rough cedar construc­ tion is featured in the picnic and dressing areas. Shaded areas are provided as well, and the entire area is fenced and well lighted for safety and beauty. 
Exciting 
This weekend marks everyone’s opportunity to see one of the most beautiful community / recreation centers in 
Bexar County. 
Timber Ridge is an ex­ citing community because of its conven­ ience to UTS A, USAA and the South Texas 
Medical Center. The re­ sidential area is just three minutes north of 
NAV. Loop 41o on Culebra 
Road; only 
2o from downtown San Antonio. 
Another plus for 
Timber Ridge, in addi­ tion to its recreational facilities, would be the advantages of fine

Thus far, there has been no shortgage of oil or gas in the United 
Stales; it’s just a matter of getting it to where ifs needed, says the Better

The largest users, the electric utilities which use our fuel for generat­ ing electricity, are easing off as coal becomes more readily available; so, by next winter, there may be plenty of fuel on the market for house heat­ ing.

The three- and four-be- droom homes in Timber

Timber Ridge actually is a community of the future but is ready for you to move in today.

See and feel the differ­ ence that careful thought and consideration can make in the planning of a new community that has saved the best nature created — the shape of the land and the thou­ sands of natural live oak and cedar trees which grace the gently rolling slopes.

Living inside Thousand 
Oaks, you sense that quality was the prime consideration. 
Only builders known for their fine craftsmanship were selected to partiepate in the development of the community. 
Designed with imagin­ ation and flair. Thousand 
Oaks homes are filled with ideas to enhance your lifestyle. Vaulted ceilings, sunken living room areas, woodburn- ing fireplaces, private gardens and atriums are but a few of the luxury features. 
You’ll find Mexican tile floors, deep plush car­ peting, color-coordinated wallcoverings and gla­ morous country kitchens with garden windows for growing herbs. Meal planning for your family or entertaining for friends becomes a plea­ sure, and, with all the 

O ld fuel lf your house is heated by a boiler, you probably have plenty .of excess ca­ pacity for the coldest days, reports the Belter 
Heating-Cooling Council. 
If the heating seemed scant at times, your heating contractor can raise the water tempera­ ture to give you all the comfort you need. 
If you were depending on electric heat and couldn’t quite make it, it would be necessary to install additional heaters, as such units have a fixed output and are often sized right on the borderline.

Within the community, you’ll find Thousand

Antonio. There are light­ ed outdoor courts, air conditioned indoor courts, an Olympic size outdoor pool and a health club which features ex­ ercise rooms, sauna and steam rooms and an in­ door pool. As a resident of Thousand Oaks, you have special member­

A Ray Ellison community of fine homes is a 

 combination of many factors thoroughly 

 weighed before development: from compo­ 

 sition of the soil itself to utilities access; 

 proximity to major arteries and express­ 

 ways, shopping centers, schools and other 

 conveniences and necessities of modern 

 living. Ray Ellison's attention to these fac­ 

 tors affect the life-long value of your new 

 home investment. 

All around San Antonio 
Ellison home sales thriving 

Tho new home m arket in San An­ tonio is a '‘bull” market today, and new homes arc being sold as fast as the builders can produce them to the meet the heavier demand. 
That's the general consensus among homebuilders in San Antonio, and Ray 
Ellison Sr., the city ’s largest home­ builder and chairman of the board of 
Ray Ellison Industries, believes new home sales for 1977 may be up by much as 5o per cent over the previous year’s totals. 

Sales doubled 

Ellison, who sells every fourth house built in the Alam o City and whose homes now house approximately 7o,ooo 
San A ntonians, has announced that new home sales by his firm, during the 

 first three months of the year, ha\e doubled sales figures for the first three months of 1976. 
E llison has noted that his firm is responding to dem and by launching more housing starts during the first quarter of 1977 than in any comparable period in the en tire history of the company. 
The consum er realizes the impact of inflation on the housing industry, El­ lison pointed out, and he doesn’t want to wait any longer to make his new hom e in vestm en t. Although Ellison con ced ed that in fla tio n a ry factors would continue to be felt throughout the housing industry during 1977. he said many fam ilies were determined to carry through w ith new home pur­ chases, despite rising costs. 
‘i'm not exaggerating when I sax 

 that, if som eone wants to be able to move into a new Ray Ellison home be­ fore the start of the school year next 
Septem ber,” he declared, ‘‘th ey ’re going to have to move fast because a lot of other people have the sam e idea.” 
Because of inflationary pressures in costs of lum ber and other building m aterials, E lliso n said one of his firm s primary objectives at the pre­ sent time is ‘‘to see how we can keep that inflationary gap just as narrow as possible, without com prom ising the quality of our product.” 

He pointed out that the price of a new home is going up at a rate of about >2 cl I per cent per month, and he expects that rate to hold fairly constant. 
‘‘The homebuyer sees what is hap­ 

 pening to costs,” Ellison stated, “but he's looking at the other side of the coin — and this holds true whether he’s buying an Ellison home or considering some other builder — he knows that, if he buys now, he can take advantage of that inflationary rate in term s of his own equity advantages.” 
Ellison said he believes today’s ho­ meowner realizes the American home is one of the last vestiges of personal pride of ownership in this country. 
"People want as much as they can get for their dollar, and that includes com I ort and sp a cio u sn ess because that’s the kind of lifestyle they want for their fam ilies,” he said. “We believe the kind of home they're looking for, at reasonable p rices, and w e’re doing everything we can lo keep prices in line with people’s expectations.”

French Creek Village, an attractive community off B a n d e ra Road and north of Leon Valley, will feature new homes by a fam ily firm this w ee­ kend. 
T. E , Hetherington & 
D a u g h te rs is the firm building a wide array of new homes in the seren­ ely situated community in northw estern B e x a r 
County. 
Variety 
The firm draw s from some 4o different floor plans while building in 
F ren ch C reek V illa ge . 
Such an a rra n g e m e n t c a lls for g re a t v ariety a m o n g the d iffere n t homes which ran ge, in size, from th re e-b e­ droom, two-bath to five- bedroom, 3V2-bath plans. 
The various plans also call for a wide range of sq u a r e fo o ta ge , from 
1,7oo to 3,ooo sq . it.. 
Surprisingly, these new’ homes a re placed in a flexible price range that makes each a great bar­ gain : from a s low as 
$48,ooo to only $65,ooo. 
V ariety a lso can be seen a m o n g the m any and v a rie d e x te rio r stylings applied to these homes. Ranging from the very tra d itio n a l to the extremely modern, if not futuristic, these designs c re a te an im p r e s siv e 

 blen ding along the streets of French Creek 
Village. In fact, they are one of the main reasons the community is so at­ tractive. 
As one would expect, these hom es contain a la rg e n u m ber of s t a n ­ d a rd s a ctu ally c o n si­ dered “ extras” by some builders. Fine carpeting, b eam ed c e ilin g s, wet b ars and the most m o­ dern of F r ig id a ir e a p ­ pliances are among the features of many of these homes. 
French Creek Village is a community well re­ moved from the noise and co n gestion of the 
“ m e tro p le x ” but near many m ajor destination points like the South 
T exas M edical Center, 
UTSA. USA A and NAV. 
Loop 41o, which, in turn, quickly lea d s to other site s such a s the 
Southw est

AFBs. 
French Creek Village is reached m ost easily simply by exiting from 
NAV. Loop 41o onto Ban­ dera Road and driving north of Leon Valley to the co m m u n ity ’s large billboard sign m arking its entranceway. 

Keep cool 

 lf you’re in the market for a room air conditioner, get the size you need. If i f s too big, it will cost more to buy and more to run and may not give you the comfort you want. On a hot sum m er’s day, you will have to repeatedly turn it off, then on again, indicating you’re either too chilly or too warm. 

And don’t think an oversized unit will do much tor the rest of the house, advises the Better Heating- 
Cooling Council. Most of the cool air will stay in that one room, and very little will be pushed through the doorway. 

Some of the new air conditioners are highly efficient, giving you more Btu’s for your Kilowatt dollar, so check into the Energy Efficiency Ratio before you buy. Room air conditioning unit with their economical individual control, combined with zoned hadronic heating in Winter, will give you comfort and economy for all seasons. 

‘Uniqueness’ underlies 
Green Spring Valley 

Green Spring Valley, an excitin g new su b d i­ vision just north of the 
San Antonio city limits, offers homeowners a un­ ique living environment in a natural community carefully planned.

3o-acre green belt deeded to homeowners. Nature tr a ils wind through a heavily wooded section of this belt. Huge, old oaks line the tr a ils . T h ese tre e s and th eir u n d e r­ growth have been left in their natural state. 
The green belt also in­ clu d e s a picn ic a r e a , complete with tables, and a grassy meadow with a football g rid . P a re n ts will be glad children can reach the park without c r o ss in g any m a jo r streets. 

The s u b d iv isio n ’s swimming pool and ten­ nis courts also have been built with the landscape in mind. Tall oak trees shade the swimming a r­ ea, complete with a wa­ terfall, rock-lined walk­ ways and an island in the middle of the pool. Green

Sh o u ld thee go ahead and buy that hom e now or wait for 
P 
J 

 interest rates to drop from th eir present high? 

Word o f an expert 

 l a k e the w ord of such an expert as S y lv ia Po rter, the 

 noted s M id ie a te d financial new spaper colum nist, that the 

 fam ily interested in hom e b uying w ould do well to buy it now. 

Sh o u ld son com m it yourself now lo record high rates 

 on a 25- or 3o-year mortgage or w ait and see about you r chances at a possibly lo w er rate, she asked. 

H ere was h e r own answer: ' Assum ing that, on average, 

 the purchase p rice o f a house increases by IO per cent a year — a reasonable assum ption — you w ill not save by waiting fo r low er mortgage ra te s to buy so u r house.** 

T o illustrate: 

• lf von are looking at a $36,ooo hom e, with a IO per 

 cent down paym ent of $3,6oo. that same home, a year from now. w ill probably cost $3o,6oo (reflecting a IO per cent increase in p rice), w ith a down paym ent of $3,o6o. 

Im m ed iately, you have saved $36o. 

• ll son com pute the m o nthly paym ent on a 25-year 

 mortgage for the house this year at o'/2 per cent. you pa\ 
$2o.3.16. Now. if you wait a year and if the mortgage rate drops a fu ll percentage point to per cent. you w ill pay 

$286.o8 per m onth — or $3.82 per m onth more. In one 

 year. that s $15.84. O v e r 25 years that com es to $1,146. 

• ll you add the $1,146 saved on yo u r m onthly pay­ ments to the $36o saved on the in itial dow n paym ent, you rom e up with a total of $1,5o6 saved over the term of the mortgage. 

Sim p ly put. this means that, unless there is a steep 

 decline in interest rates (high ly u n lik e ly ) as well as a 

 drastic reduction in tin* price of housing (also u n lik e ly ). there is no way you eau save money by w aiting to buy. 

It must be understood that, just lik e everyth in g else in 

 our econom y, housing costs w ill con tinue to list*: existing 

 homes, appreciate in value. T hat means that a delay in 

 p u rc h a s e w ill result in higher down p a y m e n ts and a larger m onthly paym ent on a larger mortgage. 

O th e r investm ent points should be considered along 

 with the cost savings by buying now. They are: the equity you build up in y o u r hom e through payment on the 

 mortgage p rin cip al: the ap p reciation of tin* hom e's value: and the tax advantages gained by allow ab le deductions for real estate taxes and interest paym ents.

2 major changes made at Broadway Bank 

G ER G O R Y W . CRANE 

WILLIAM A. BROW N 

Charles E. ( hoover Jr., president of 
Broadway National Bank, has an­ nounced major management changes at the bank effective this month. 
Gregory VV. Crane, senior vice pre­ sident of its Mortgage Banking Di­ vision, has been designated executive vice president of the bank and will assume the responsibility for all gen­ eral banking operational and adminis­ trative areas. 

Successor 

Simultaneously, Cheever announced the election of William A. Brown as senior vice president and manager of the Mortgage Banking Division to suc­ ceed Crane. 
Crane joined the bank in 1965 as a mortgage lending officer and has been responsible for the development of the 
Mortgage Banking Division since that time. Broadway National Bank’s 
Mortgage Banking Division sells and services real estate loans for institu­ tional investors nationwide. In a recent compilation of commercial banks per­ forming the mortgage servicing func­ tion. it stood 58th in the U. S., with a servicing portfolio over $6o million. 
Brown has been in the mortgage banking business in Los Angeles since 
1947, where he has been associated with Ralph C. Sutro Co., holding many positions in the company from con­ struction inspector to, more recently, president. Sutro is the 47th largest mortgage banking concern in the U. S. and services over $8oo million for more than IOO institutional investors. 
Brown’s family will soon be joining him in San Antonio. 
“ We are most delighted with these management changes,” said Cheever. 
“ Mr. Crane has done an outstanding job in developing the leading bank mortgage banking operation in the city of San Antonio and, perhaps, the state. 
This is an excellent opportunity for him to employ his many talents in the general banking field and bring, to the whole bank, his expertise and leader­ ship. Mr. Brown has a very broad background in the mortgage banking field, and it is the intention of the bank to further expand its activities in this areas as a result of his association with the bank.” 
Broadway National Bank, N.E. Loop 
41o at Nacogdoches Road, had year-end deposits of $131.8 million. It has one affiliate, Eisenhower National Bank at 
Fort Sam Houston.

 promises to be the most exciting ever by featuring three solar homes of the future, according to W ayne Jaroszewski, parade chairman for the Greater San Antonio Builders Association. 
"The three homes are being built by San Antonio Ranch in conjunction with a grant they received from the Energy Research and

Can be better 
When you’re ready to replace that 5o-year old boiler and the lower bidder is offering a smaller boiler, he may be doing you an important favor 
When a boiler is sized accurately for the house, it will consume less fuel than one which is grossly oversized. 
But is that little boiler big enough? Ask to see the low bidder’s "heat loss" calculations, suggest the 
Better Heating-Cooling Council. If he has figured it accurately, he will be glad to explain them to you. 
Then you can judge for yourself if the size he recommends will satisfy the heat loss, saving yourself money both during installation and opera­ tion.

 lint vv tnle most consider the Rhine River a n d th e R h i n e l a n d as one, there is far more to this region. The e x p a n ­ sive area cnetered about the Mosel. Abr, and Nahe ri v e r s a n d va ll e ys has much to offer the adven­ turous tourist. 
The Mosel River, a tri­ bu ta ry of the Rhine, is not as grand in scope as big brother, but in many ways it is equally attrac­ tive and c h a r m i n g . Its special luster comes not only f r o m its ph ysical beauty, but being off the proverbial beaten trhck, the co u n tr y s id e is less crow ded, less frenetic. 
Less expensive, too. 
While the Rhine flows to aud th r o u g h m a j o r 
E u r o p e a n c e n t e r s of commerce and industry, the M o s e l's b a n k s a r e dotted with quaint cities and towns of incompara­ ble charm. 
Winn in g e n , Coe he rn and Bernkastel are three of th e m o r e p o p u la r vv ine-grow ing c e n t e r s , typical of the jewel-like towns one finds nestled amidst the terraced hills where the region's famed wine grapes grow.

McGarrig le Sisters: 

4 
Long-awaited album 

Playback 
Tho care, feeding and toilet training of the po­ pular media by tho mu­ sic industry is some­ times just a wonder to behold. 
About once every six months or so someone in the music business takes a rolled up newspaper to those hip editors of Time and Newsweek and gets them to roll over. 
That is when those cover stories pop up fawning over the latest bright new star who is on the cutting edge of all of popular culture, accord­ ing to a spokesman close to culture. 
You can see it coming sometimes. In recent weeks there have been a few hints that the next recipients of this high honor could be a sister act named Hate and An­ na McGarrigle. 
Some of the McGarn- gles’ songs have been recorded by Linda Ron- stadt and you know what that with-it bunch at 
Time-Life thinks of Lin­ da. 

THE D EBI T ALBUM, 
"Kate and Anna MeGar- rtgle,” showed up on -all kinds of Top IO lists at the end of 1976 despite the fact that it just layed around the record stores all year without bother­ ing anybody. 
The stage was all set for Rate and Anna to come roaring out with a second album that could be a commercial mon­ ster. Which is why I am just pleased as punch that they have come out with 
"Dancer with 
Bruised Knees” (Warner 
Bros.) 
These ladies have integrity. This is about the most uncommercial long-awaited commercial album you can imagine. 
It is also very good. 
First of all, there really is a title song. It is a sweet little ditty about a ballet star who used to soar through the air into the waiting arms of her partner. Bul when you get a little too chunky lo soar or your partner’s waiting arms start to shake a bit, you are heading for a crash. 
There are also no less than three songs in 
French, which is a bit much for those who in­ sist that performers talk 
American. 
The plots to two of the 
French tunes are sum­ marized on the back of the album for those who insist. 
Knowing the tale of the lover hiding in the pantry who was eaten by rats, no doubt will add immeasurably to the lis­ tening enjoyment of that merry little folk tune. 

By Joel McNally 

BY NOW you are perhaps under the im­ pression that something strange is going on here. 
But really the strangest thing is just that Rate and Anna McGarrigle have put out a second album of their music without compromising a thing. 
The French is not for elitist effect. Rate and 
Anna grew up in a 
French speaking house­ hold in Quebec. 
The McGarrigles make music with instruments like the button accor­ dion, the recorder, the banjo and something called the piano. 
It doesn’t sound like something produced by the electronic wizardry of a recording studio. It sounds like real music. 
The voices of Rate and 
Anna are interchangea­ ble and they spend a lot of time interchanging and mingling them. 
Frequently the effect al­ most approaches an 
English madrigal. Other times one will lay back and let the other carry a simple lovely melody. 
"Walking Song” is as beautiful a love song as has been written. 
"Southern Boys,” "First 
Born” and "Kitty Come 

MICKEY NEW BURY 

Home ’ are effective in both sound utxi meaning. | 
The hype machine was all set to start promoting 
Rate and Anna McGar­ rigle as the most excit­ ing new phenomenon in music today. 
Then they come along with an album of classy music that doesn’t re­ motely fit into the pop mold. I think that is a pretty exciting new phenomenon. 

ONE 
OF 
T H E S E 
DAYS Mickey Newbury is going to put out a popular album. 
As the songwriter who gave us jewels like "San 
Francisco Mabel Joy” and "The 33rd of Au­ gust,” he deserves more attention than many of those who get it. 
Unfortunately, “ Rusty 
Tracks” (ABC), is not a good candidate for any breakthroughs. 

The rusty tracks re­ ferred to are vintage stings like "Danny Boy,” 
"Shenandoah,” "In the 
Fines” and "That Lucky 
Old Sun” which make up half of the album. 
Committed fans might be interested to see how 
Newbury handles those old standards in his bluesy personal style, but that may even be a few too many for them. 
All those creaking tunes also take up space that could be filled with 
Mickey Newbury songs. 
"Hand Me Another of 
Those,” 
"T e ll 
Him 
Boys,” “ Leavin’ Ren tucky” and "‘Bless Us 
All” are all new New­ bury. Someday maybe we will get a lot more. 
Maybe things will fall just right and people will realize that in his low key way Mickey New bury makes a lot of very good music. 
SOUTHERN GUITAR 
PLAYERS don’t neee- sarily play a lot of notes and they don't neeessar ily play them real fast. 
But they sure do bend them. 
That is the biggest impression left by Toy 
Caldwell and his bunch on "Carolina Dreams” 
(Capricorn), the new a1 bum by The Marshall 
Tucker Band. 
It is a surprisingly disciplined album, which probably hits its stride with the tumbling tumbleweed rhythm of 
"Desert Skies,” the out law rock of "Never Trust a Stranger” and the go­ spel, "Tell ll lo the De­ vil.” 
With the end of the 
Allmans, the Tucker band is Macon’s leading export now. Maybe that is why they are so taste ful and responsible. 

Ex-Beatle’s life is full of changes

Former Beatle George 
Harrison says he was in a better mood last sum­ mer when he made his new album, “ Thirty- three and 1-3” than he was when he made his last album, “ Extra Tex­ ture.” 
Why? 
"Why not?” 
It’s one of those quick answers the Beatles used to give in the early days of their giant fame and packed press confer­ ences. 
But Harrison now has been a solo performer for seven years and he quickly adds, as befits his present maturity, 
"Because I just concen­ trated on doing the al­ bum. I avoided everyth­ ing else. Previously I was trying to do half a dozen things at the same time.” 

IT’S EASY to under­ stand how Harrison got embroiled in doing half a dozen other things while making an album. At the moment of the conversa­ tion, he is in the makeup room at NBC-TV in New 
York, his face being made up for *'Saturday 
Night.” Paul Simon, host of the show, is in the next makeup chair. 
Harrison is answering interview questions. And wisps of girls connected with the network come in to say things like, "I love your whole life.” Ear­ lier, during rehearsal of 
Simon and 
Harrison duets, "Here Comes the 
Sun.” 
“ Homeward 
Bound” and “ By, By 
Love,” one of the girls has said to another, 
"George Harrison smiled at me.” She received the reply, "Oh, I wouldn’t know what to do.” 
George Harrison isn t even a run-of-the-mill superstar. He’s a one­ time Beatle and the awe the Beatles generated has not yet gone away. 
Harrison tells the ma­ keup man not to pull too much on his face. He says he’s afraid he peaked for the day at 3 p.m.; he’s tired because he hasn’t been getting enough sleep. 
His plan was to go from New York to Lon­ don, then to Bombay, In­ dia, for the wedding of 
Ravi Shankar’s niece to a violinist in the band that toured with Harrison on his 1974 American tour. 
Then he and Shankar. the sitar player who is 
India’s best known mu­ sician abroad, were to go to the birthday celebra­ tion of Satya Sal Baba. 
Harrison says, "He is a very famous holy man in 
India.” 

HOWEVER, he adds, 
"Fill not sure now I’m going to get to India in time. I’m so wiped out. 
Maybe when I get back to England FII take a bit of a rest before I go there.” 
He probably doesn’t have as much money as people think. Harrison says, "after all those years of the Beatles 
I sjM’nd a hit of time in Los’ 
Angeles but my resi- 

GEQRGE HARRISON still has snappy answer*, but has tempered them with maturity. 

 donee is in the United 
Kingdom. Taxes are 93 per cent there. 
"Having had money sort of puts it in proportion for you. But ifs handy to have it. I need it to keep living in the style that I’m accus­ tomed to, which includes a lot of travel. That’s not to say I always want to live in that style. Some­ day I won’t.” 
Another network girl enters with copies con­ tracts for the show. Har­ rison reads the contract entirely. "I don’t think 
I ’m allowed to earn money in the States. But that’s okay. You could call that amount no money.” He signs copy alter copy and asks the girl if there’s one for each member of the au­ dience. 
To the question whether the Beatles will have a reunion, Harrison says, "N o t at the mo­ ment.” 
In November 
1974, 

Harriaon became the first of the four former 
Beatles to tour America on his own, with a band. 
He also had Shankar and a large group of other musicians from India with him, playing some of their music during the concert. Many critics didn’t like it and some of the big halls around the country didn’t sell out. 
Earlier in 
1974, 
Harrison had formed his own record company, 
Dark Horse, which now is distributed by Warner 
Brothers. A movie, "Lit­ tle Malcolm,” of which he was executive pro­ ducer, won awards in 
Berlin and Atlanta. 

TWO 
ALBUM S, 
"Shankar 
Family and 
Friends” and 
"The 
Place 
I 
Love” by 
Splinter, both produced by Harrison, came out on 
Dark Horse and he made an album of his own, 
"Dark Horse.” 
Ravi Shankar Music 

Festival from India, with 
Harrison as producer and participant, was held in London and then con­ certs were given in five other European cities. 
He liked the 1974 tour, 
Harrison said. "That is, except for the fact I had too much work on that year. I was really tired and didn’t have a throat; 
I wasn’t physically in good condition. I thought the band was great. 
" I found the people who came to see it who didn’t have preconceived ideas enjoyed it. It was the people who came ex­ pecting to see the Beatles who didn’t enjoy it. 
That’s part of what I was trying to say, ‘I’m not the Beatles. I’m me, you know,’” 
Harrison says he may tour again next summer, but without the musi­ cians from India because that takes a lot of time to organize, and in smaller halls. With Paul Simon saying, "You know you love it,” Harrison says, 
"I don't like playing to 
Madison Square Garden. 
You can only see the first four rows.” 
George 
Harrison al­ bums have bEH*n doing all right. Gold are ‘ ’ All 
Things Must Pass,” 197o; 
"The Concert for Bangla 
Desh,” 1972; "Livin’ in the Material World,” 
1973; "D ark Horse,” 
1974, and "Extra Tex­ ture,” 1975. 

THE 197o SINGLE 
"My Sweel Lord,” also is gold. Harrison lost a plagiarism suit in 
September, a feder­ al judge saying that song was "virtually identical except for one phrase” with the 1962 Chiffons hit by John Mack, "He’s So 
Fine.” The judge also said that Harrison didn’t plagiarize consciously • 
"I was getting almost depressed,” Harrison says, “ but I decided I’d take it positively. I wrote a song about it.” 
The song, titled, "This 
Song.” was released the week before Thanksgiv­ ing and was No. 64 on the best-selling singles chart of Nov. 27. "Thirty-three and 1-3,” the age Har­ rison was when he made the album, was released 
Thanksgiving week, too late to int the chart. 

Ben King Jr. ’s co­ lumn will resume next week. 

Ugliness covers beauty for the ear 

The axiom “ Never judge a book by its cover” applies equally well to records. 
Unfortunately, for the Connoisseur Society. many people DO judge records by their covers and it means that a lot of people will simply pass over two truly outstanding recordings because the covers are unattractive and unfathomable. 
Both are organ records — brilliantly played, with dazzling recording engineering and show­ casing music that is not seen very often on disc for some unexplainable reason, as it is all very good. 
The two records are Cierambault’s Gloria in 
Exclesis Deo, Motet de Ste. Michel and other selections featuring Gaston Litaize on organ and 
Mady Mesple soprano (CSQ2126) and 24 Pieces de Fantasie bv 
Louis Vierne, also featuring 
Litaize on organ (CS2-2119). 
The misfortune here is that the first record has the composer’s and artists’ names written in an unreadable hieroglyphic script and only by intense concentration can one find out exactly what this record is. 
What it really is is a breathtaking collection ol works by 17th Century Parisian composer Louis- 
Nicolas Clerambault, next to the last in a family line w hich served the kings of France for 3oo years. 
The works are gems of soprano-organ and organ solo. The Gloria in Excelsis Deo is truly out­ standing, and both o£-the organ suites are delights to the ear. 
I suspect sales would be 1o-fold if Connoisseur would repackage and redesign the cover in readable type and feature some title like “ Royal 
French Organ” and an appropriate painting or photo as background. 
The same can be said of the package for the second record — a two-disc collection of the works of Louis Vierne. Again, we have an identification problem, because one hasn’t got the vaguest idea what is being performed unless he is familiar with 
Vierne’s name — arid not too many people are, I suspect. 
Again, the works themselves, the performances and recordings are downright brilliant. These organ fantasies are musical pictures by a blind composer and are performed by a blind organist. 
Vierne, for those who don't know , was of the same period as Wider, composer of the popular “ Suite 
Gothique” and other works better known than those of Vierne. Both were organists in Paris and both wrote masterpieces for the big organs of that city. 
These are miniature organ “ pictures” of scenes imagined by the blind composer — among them is one titled Carillon de Westminster — a set of variations on the eight-note ringing of Big Ben in 
Westminster Tower in London’s Houses of Par­ liament which is repeated in the ringing of almost every grandfather clock ever made. 
In a delightful set simitar to Liszt’s Variations on B-A-C-H. we hear the chimes rung over and over with different colorings, tempos and timings. 
More reflective is “ Gargoyles” which creates haunting pictures of a night-time stroll through the Parisian mists with the ancient gargoyles of 
Notre Dame peering out in frightening expres­ sions at passers-by. 
Then, there is the splendor of the “ Hymn to the 
Sun" and the other assorted works on this outstanding two-record set.

DEAN MATTHEWS 
524 W. Elsmere 
EDISON HIGH SCHOOL 
Dean Matthews is a busy young man at Edison High School, involved in athletics, extra curricular activities and clubs and, of course, academics. 
Dean has received letters in golf, football and swimming. He is a mem­ ber of the Junior Golfer’s Association of South Texas and Edison's Golf 
Club, 
The son of Dr. and Mrs. Carl N. Matthews, ranked 15th in his class of 
4oo, is a member of the National Honor Society. He received an “E” award for special achievement in Spanish and a certificate of educational development for performance on the National Educational Development 
Tests. 
Perhaps Dean’s second great interest is public speaking. A five-year member of the Speech Club and a 2 second degree member of the 
National Forensic League, he has participated in speech and debate tournaments and holds a certificate in debate and a degree of honor from the National Forensic League. 
Math, particularly involving computers, also interests Dean. A mem­ ber of Edison’s computer m ath team, it is one career he is considering among law, medicine and engineering. 
Other activities and accomplishments include a perfect attendance certificate last year, membership in the Science Club, Spanish Club and 
German Club. Dean would like to attend Trinity University. He will soon be honored by the Optimist Club of San A n­ tonio for his achievements.

Billy C. and ‘holy hum or’ 

NASH VILLE Term. - 
IS IT CONT AC HOLS? - 
F irst. 
Brother 
B illy 
Carter signed with a id­ eal booking agency as an 
“ entertainer.” and now vvell-knovv n ev angelist 
Boh Harrington is on the line with a firm called 
“ Celebrity 
M anage­ ment.” 
Harrington, known as 
“ The Chaplain of Bour­ bon Street" (New O r­ leans style), will head­ line an act he describes as “ holy humor." 
Harrington, here to firm up appearances for the upcoming season, said: “ The nation is go­ ing ‘country* — and I'm going with it” 
H e'll be doing his thing, country style, in auditoriums, arenas, state and county fairs, nightclubs — even in Las 
Vegas. 
“ Why not Vegas?” he asked. “ There is no place Bob is afraid to go.” 
Harrington em pha­ sized he was not forsak­ ing his preaching, his 
“ one-day rallies.” 
He admitted the newest facet of his career was 
“ rather revolutionary.” but doesn’t believe his le­ gions of fans will defect. 
“ FII offer inspirational entertainment with over­ tones of comedy and philosophy. Perhaps 1 11 be a modern day W ill 
Rogers," he added. 
Harrington is going to appear on shows with country music singers but plans no singing. 
“ I ll leave the singing to the likes of Johnny 
Cash. B ill Anderson. 
Way Ion and Willie. Con­ way Twitty and Ray Ste­ vens," he said. “ After all. I can't sing a note unless it’s a 9o-day note at the bank. 
“ I don't see how my act can fail,” he said. “ I have the greatest pro­ ducer and the greatest director — He has never

 had a flop. I refer, of course, to the Good Lord. 
“ And." he said, “ I am not in competition with good ole boys like Jerry 
Clower and Brother Billy 
( ’arter. Our approach is different and they don’t have the red tie. the red sox and the red Bible like 
I do. No offense, of course. 
Je rr y and 
Brother Billy are God­ fearing folks. 
“ I am also going to do an album of some of my homespun holy humor and be doing guest shots on TV and radio shows in my new role. I recently appeared on Sammy Da­ vis 
J r . ’s syndicated series. 
“ Who knows?” he laughed. 
“ I may be invited to perform on the 
Grand Ole Opry. 
“ I'm willing. After all, 
I have God-guided-guts.” 
Bob Bray, co-owner of 
Celebrity Management with veteran showman 
Happy Shahan of Brack- ettsville’s Alamo Village, said Harrington already had been booked for nu­ merous appearances throughout the country. 
“ He’s going to be a very popular new form of country music entertain­ ment.” Brav predicted. 
O’DISSA & O 'DOTA - 
Singer Bobby G. Rice recruited the vocal aid of daughters. Connie, 5 and 
Tammy. 6. on “ Some­ where Over the Rain­ bow,” one of the songs on his newest album “ With 
Love from Bobby G. 
Rice.” 
“ It felt literally like being at home.” Bobby commented after the studio session concluded. 
Rice’s agent, Larry Wilt, facetiously remarked, 
“ It looks like I ’m going to be booking the ‘Bobby 
G. Rice Trio.’? ”

.“ It was too time-con­ sum ing.” she said. 
“ Money, despite stories printed mostly in the trade press, had nothing to do with it. And I couldn’t seem to get it together the way I want­ ed it. It was difficult to do it well and keep my schedule of personal ap­ pearances going. 
“ I just decided the

Like El Paso Texans drop over to C iudad 
Juarez, Mexico. 
Lots of golf. 
High caliber tennis: You are tested by returning IOO serves. Rated by some computer system. Then you can pick out a partner who’s as bad as you are. (Or worse, if you’re lucky.) 
C asino g am b lin g is very big. MINIMUM bet on the crap tables is $5. 
And that's only before 5 o’clock. When the real night players begin, the bet has to be $1o. 
Some worry here that legal gambling in Atlan­ tic City will drain off the betting business.

Bahamans tend to phase out foreign businesses and take over. This in­ cludes replacing E u ro ­ pean chefs. It isn’t doing the food any good. 
Restaurants so-so and expensive. Drinks same.

New, faster film allows flashier color 

Photo Tips 

Ifs here! 
Alter a recent .Japan­ ese coup in high speed color print film, the pho­ to industry has been holding its breath, won­ dering how the great yellow father of photo­ graphy would reply. 
Wait no longer! 
And rem em ber, you heard it first in Photo 
Tips. 
A new high-speed film for color prints and three new slide films featuring improved color repro­ duction have been an­ nounced by 
E astm an 
Kodak Co. 
The higher speed of the new Kodacolor 4oo film 
(four times as fast as 
Kodacolor ll film) can be used to extend picture- taking under lighting le­ vels not possible with 
Kodacolor ll film. 
Kodacolor 4oo film is a high-speed 
(ASA 
4oo). color negative film ba­ lanced for daylight, blue flash and electronic flash The new film also has ch a ra cteristics which make it possible to obtain pleasing pictures under a variety of illu­ minant s including hou­ sehold light bulbs and flourescent lamps with­ out requiring the use of filters. 

KODACOLOR 4oo IS 
WAIL ABLE in lit) and 
135 sizes. 
The speed of new Ko­ dacolor 4oo film allows the use of faster shutter speeds which can result 

 i i i reduced camera mo­ tion encountered under the lower lighting levels found with existing light. 
The additional film speed is also valuable-lo extend picture-taking range when using flash, when photographing sporting events, action 

 subjects, during overcast days or when using a telephoto lense on 35 nim cameras. 
Kodacolor 4oo film in 
I IO size will perform well in simple, nonadjustable cameras when used in daylight down to heavy overcast or open shade conditions. For cameras that sense fast film, the low-light performance of the film will depend upon the exposure capability of the camera. 
The use of 35 nim ca­ meras having an f/2.8 or larger lens aperture makes it possible to use this film without supple­ mentary flash under most lighting conditions. 
With a lens aperture of f/2.o and a shutter speed of 1/3o second, pictures can be taken with typical home light­ ing levels at night (ap­ proximately 5 footeati­ dies of illumination). 

FOR CRITICAL LSE. filter recommendations are included with in­ struction sheets pack­ aged with 135-size films. 
List price for Kodaco­ lor. 4oo film is 135-2o ex­ posure size is 82.5o. The 
135-36 exposure size has a list price of $3.5o. 
Prices for processing 
Kodacolor 4oo film by 
Kodak Processing Labor­ atories will be slightly higher than those for the same size Kodacolor ll film to cover the cost of additional handling ex­ pected during the photo­ finishing operation. 
Print-reprint prices re­ main the same. 
Three new Kodak Ek- taehrome films for color slides intended for gen­ eral consumer use fea­ ture their ASA speed as part of the film name. 
These new Ektacromes 

Jones 

 are more useful to the amateur, travel and na­ ture photographer. A number of disagreeable characteristics in the earlier E-H film intro­ duced late last summer have been changed. 
More of the technical details on these films and some puzzling ques­ tions about both the color print and slide film will lie answered in next week’s Photo Tips. 

KODAK 
E K ? ACH 
ROME 64 FILE 
(day­ light) replaces Kodak 
Ektachrome-X film. It has improved color re­ production. slightly bet­ ter sharpness and simi­ lar grain w hen compared to the film it replaces. 
Kodak Ektaehrome 16o film (tungsten) replaces 
Kodak high speed Ek- tachrom e film (tu ng­ sten). It i*>, 1.3 stop faster 
(ASA 16o instead of ASA 
125 for the former pro­ duct), has improved co­ lor reproduction, and offers excellent results when push-processed to achieve an effective film speed of ASA 32o. Grain characteristics are simi­ lar and sharpness is slightly improved when compared with the film it replaces. 
Kodak Ektaehrome 2(Mj film (daylight) replaces 
Kodak’s high speed Ek- 

 tachrome film (daylight) and offers significantly improved grain charac­ teristics. This film offers a 
I.-estop increase in, speed (ASA 2(1o instead of ASA 16o for the former product) and has im ­ proved color reproduc­ tion with cleaner color separation between sub­ tle hues. The new film also is slightly sharper and provides excellent results when push-pro­ cessed to achieve an ef­ fective film speed of ASA 
4oo. 

ALL OF THE NEW 
Ektaehrome films are designed for Process E-6 which provides faster processing, greater pro­ cess stability, improved conservation of water and energy and which meets expected environ­ mental standards. 
List prices for the new 
Kodak Ektaehrome films and processing prices through Kodak Process­ ing Laboratories remain the sam e as for the former products. 
These new films fill a need and do away with a long-time complaint of available light photo­ graphers. 
Now there is no reason not to shoot in color. At 
4oo ASA. if you can shoot in black and white you can shoot in color. 

Unheard of Ham let 

Lights, action; w hat’s that you say? w h ite 

It’s rough to have weeks of work, dedica­ tion and inspiration defeated by a building. 
And yet, that's essentially what has hap­ pened to Incarnate Word College’s produc­ tion of “ Hamlet. 

Long before the production opened last weekehd, it was being talked about as the local theater event of the year and with good reason. 

The play is, of course, considered generally to be Shakespeare’s finest. 
It is directed by a man generally considered to be the best actor iii San 
Antonio, Ronald Ibbs, artist-in-resid cnce at 
IWC. And in the role of 
Hamlet is Richard .Jones, often talked of as being 
Ibbs’ match in perform­ ing talent. And the play attracted some of the 
I lest talents in the city for its supporting and minor roles. 

There is simply too much talent and too much work in this pro­ duction for me lo believe what I saw and heard opening night 
— or rather, what I didn’t hear opening night. 

Inaudible 

Silting about two-thirds of the way. back in the Incarnate 
Word Auditorium, I was forced to strain to Ti ear the dialog and was only able to pick up about half, of it over the rustling of bodies and clothes in the auditorium. 

Persons who attended subsequent perfor­ mances have told me that they could hear better than I did either because they sat toward the front of the auditorium or be­ cause-the audience was less restless. 

But the fact remains that the auditorium was an absolute detriment to 
“ H am let.” What good was in the show was bur­ ied beneath the auditor­ ium’s aeeoustics. 

And yet Ibbs had little choice but to stage 
“ Hamlet’’ in the auditor­ ium. 
The only other space at NVC for staging 

 plays is the Downstage 
Theater. Downstage is a converted classroom that holds about SO persons. It is a fine theater for small, ultimate produc­ tions. But Ibbs. knowing that “ Hamlet” would at­ tract big audiences, was forced to move to the au­ ditorium. 

New theater 

Obviously, what was needed was a theater somewhere between the smallness of Downstage and the vastness of the auditorium. 

And a new theater is what Incarnate Word 
College is after. The col­ lege’s board recently ap­ proved architectural de­ signs and site location for a proposed new teaching theater complex. 

Right now, the plans are still on the drawing board as the college be­ gins to seek the $1,6 mil­ lion needed for construc­ tion of the theater. 

The designs, by the firm of Ford. Powell and 
Carson, look as though they would provide an ideal theater for IWC. It would seat about 3oo per­ sons, and have complete facilities for staging and teaching. 

Deserves it 

There is no doubt that 
IWC, Ibbs and his wife, arlist-in-residenee Maur­ een Halligan, deserve.the theater. 

In the IO years or so since Ibbs and Halligan came to Incarnate Word 
College, they have been responsible for staging the most consistently hi o i quality theater in the city. They have made a college theater into a community theater, attracting the most ta­ lented performers in the city to work with stu­ dents in productions that are always fine artistic 

 creations and high enter­ tainment. 

The productions are so good. in fact, that the small 
Downstage 
Theater is practically al­ ways sold-oul. It's not uncommon for a play to close with several hundred persons on a waiting list for tickets. 

Currently the only so­ lution is, as with “ Ham­ le t.” to move into the auditorium But the au­ ditorium w a s not de­ signed for stage presen­ tations. It dwarfs the au­ dience and the actors. 

The new theater pro­ ject, called INWORTH, an acronym for IN c a r ­ nate WORd TH eater, would solve all that. And right now it’s difficult to think of a theater project more deserving and in need of support. 

Plans bkt* this usually move slowly . Bul we can hope that before too long, 
Ibbs and Halligan will have decent facilities for staging their plays. 

And when that tim e comes, someone should remember the two people who have contributed so much to drama at IWC and in San Antonio. 

Of course, with pro­ jects like this, it is cus­ tomary to name it after the person who co n tri­ butes the most money. 
But one hopes there will be an exception in this case. One hopes that the new theater will bi* named after the two peo­ ple who have contributed more than money . . . who have contributed ex­ perience, talent, patience and love for theater — 
Ronald Ibbs and Maur­ een Halligan. 

These two people have changed the face of theater in San Antonio permanently. It is only fitting that there be a permanent tribute to their work.

By STERLIN 
HOLMESLY 
Humphrey Bogart ain’t in it, kid, but he domin­ ates a novel called THE 
ALPHA RAID (Morrow; 
$7.95) by Alan Schole- field. 
The story is this: A 
German paddle-wheel steamer dominates Lake 
Tanganyika during the 
East African portion of 
World War I. A deter­ 

 mined little band sets out to sink the steamer. 
Well, yes, that does conjure up Bogart in 
■‘The African Queen.” 
The determined band is 
25 British sailors with two motor gunboats in­ stead of Bogart and Hep­ burn with the African 
Queen. 
Commanding the expe­ dition through jungle, savannah and rough 

 river is 
Commander 
Bagley, who well could have been kin to Bogart’s 
(’apt. 
Queeg of the 
“(’aine Mutiny.” He, too, has blotted his record and fear of failure causes him to fail. 

More parallels can be drawn. Justine Jumelle, a nurse show falls for a young officer, could be another version of Hep­ burn’s Rosie going for 
Willie 
Keith of the 
“Caine.” 

All of this really is un­ fair to Scholefield. He has written a good action story with a tension-filled plot and a different twist 

 at the end. He has not plagiarized anyone, . . but he does have some debts to C.S. Forester and Herman Wouk. 

“ The Alpha Raid” is good reading by itself. 
But Bogart does persis­ tently intrude for anyone who has read either book or seen "The African 
Queen” and/or ‘‘The 
('aine Mutiny.”

By JIM PRICE 

Virginia power brokers aren’t going to like Gar­ rett Epps’ THE SHAD 
TREATMENT (G. P. 
Putnam Sons; $9.95). . 
Image for a politician 

 is everything, and for the movers and shakers. 
Epps paints an image of the enemy of the ordin­ ary man and woman and the pal of the corpora­ tions, banks and wealthy. 
It is the story of the 

CHURCH THEATER'S production o f "T w o for the Seesaw*’ stars T om P arker and T ern 
P ena R oss. See Stage in the Arts C alendar. 

“ outs” trying to throw out the “ ins,” who have been entrenched for half a century in state offices. 

And it is the story of the New South — of the conservatives trying to beat back a tide of mo­ derates and liberals, blacks, labor and popu­ lists. 

The general theme could be applied from 
Virginia to Texas. 
But this story is that of 
Virginia— of fiery popu­ list Tom Jeff Shadwell and campaign aid Mac 
Evans. 
It is also a story of money — the life blood of politics — distortions and hope. 
For State Sen. Shad- well has been fighting the power structure for 2o years and his goal almost is within reach.

And for Evans, victory means vindication for his father, Col. Joshua Tute- lo Evans, a fighting li­ beral driven into exile by slander and smear, and vindication for his brother, Lester, whose cautious pursuit of power and respect was ended by cancer and death. 
It also will mean re­ spect for Mac, a former 
Harvard student radical. 
And while Epps pro­ vides excellent insight into a statewide cam­ 

 paign, his ending leaves much to be desired. 
While the end result is plausible, the final ac­ tions of Evans are hard to believe. 
But it’s worth reading. 
Obviously 
Epps has created a labor of love. 
His background of spending half of his 26 years in reporting or po­ litics shows. 
But a lot of Virginians aren’t going to like Epps’ first novel. Too much truth is told.

Jule, Joe bet on new show 

NKW VORK — Whon the famous composer 
.lute Sty ne was reported to have gone to Aqueduct racetrack to do “ rea- search,” everyone smiled because he is a tenacious handicapper who once asked a psy­ chiatrist to make him stop gambling and of­ fered to bet him $1o,ooo he couldn’t do it. 
Actually the peppery little author of more than 
2oo hits did go to the 
Jockey’s row to consult jockey Angel Cordero about a play, “ Jockeys,” that he's producing with the big-hearted restaura­ teur, Cry in’ Joe. who's been known to slop over at an old buddy’s sob story and offer to give him his restaurant. 
“ I ’m boltin’ on this show,’’ says Hipness. 
“ Life is a bet. 
“ I used to say when I went home it was 3 to I my wife would have left me and wouldn’t be there. Now it’s 3 to I she will be there. I bet 
$4oo,ooo on ‘Seesaw.’ It could have made it with one more notice. 
“ I always feel bad for about 24 hours after I lose.” 
It was after “ Seesaw” that Joe made the com­ ment, “ Show business is a cancer nobody wants to get rid of.” 
Jule, short and fiery, and Joe, tall and fiery, have been friends for 3o years, and had a hit, 
“ High Button Shoes,” together. They discussed their handshake deal at 
Joe’s Pier 52. 
“ The shrink I went to,” Sty ne said, “ told me, ‘Not a chance you can quit gambling, with the business you’re in. 
You gamble a year of your life when you start a show.’” 
He dropped $15o,ooo on 
Sammy Davis on “ Mr. 
Wonderful.” Now he bets with OTB, a modest $2. 
$4 and one triple $4 bet — not the bundles he’s been known to hate wagered. 
“ I don’t bet on other things,” Joe says. “ Since they stopped dumping 

On Broadway 

By EARL WILSON 

 fights, you can’t find a dishonest fight to bet on any more.” 
For all their know­ ledge of betting, they’re producing a non-betting 
-show , a love and success story by 
Frank 
Sier- ing and Milton Katse- las, out of a California play workshop, 
It brings in Chuck 
Vannero as the jockey. 
When Styne took Van­ nero to meet Angel Cor­ dero, the latter said, 
“ Bet on me in the fourth race.” 
“ He didn’t say anyth­ ing about the first race, but I bet on him in that and he won. He didn’t win in the fourth race.” 
“ Jockeys” concerns a 
Puerto Rican rider who has trouble getting a mount, and his girl. 

“ It’s a story of if you want anything enough, you can get it.” 
Styne, a musical pro­ digy pianist and a hit composer for 4o years, has been acclaimed by musicians all over the world. 
Once Jerom e 
Kern summoned him, invited him to his study, and opened a desk drawer. 
Styne quivered with an­ ticipation. 
“ Ira Gershwin tells me you’re the greatest handicapper living,” he said. 
He pulled out 
“ Racing Form.” 
Styng picked out so many winners that Kern said, “ Same time tomor­ row.” 
Cryin’ Joe is a busi­ ness-type producer. 
Styne came from London 

 al 8, Joe from Odessa at 
13. Jo e ’s big smashes have been “ Applause” and “ La Plume de Ma 
Tanto,” but he’s frank to say : . 
“ My biggest gamble was my three m ar­ riages.” 

Styne’s shows include 
“ Gypsy," “ Funny G irl.” 
“ Gentlemen 
Prefer 
Blondes.” “ Peter Pan" and “ Bells Are Ringing" 
— and 4o others — but he laughs at his friend Joe’s remarks. 
Joe started producing 

 w ith producer Alexander 
IL Cohen. One day Joe said to Cohen. “ You picked three losers in a row. Now let me pick one.” 

Joe picked “ High But­ ton Shoes." 
But C ryin ’ Jo e fre­ quently says. “ Remind me to do a show without authors and composers.”

SAYINGS 
OF THI 
WEEK . . . 
• BARBRA 
STREISAND talking about her public im­ age: "There is a need to create a bitch goddess and I seem to be it. They’ve built me into some kind of ruthless monster and I’m stuck with it!’ 
• GERALDINE 
BROOKS, veteran actress: 
"The 
George Peppards and Eliza­ beth Ashleys (rf the world—all the so-called pretty folk around today who are leading ladies and gentlemen—I think ten years from now you’re not going to remember their names.” 
• RICHARD 
CHAMBER­ 
LAIN, who plays a telepathic lawyer in the new movie, 
Last Wave: "I ve been fol­ lowing transcendental and trans-human thought most of my life. I’m very interested in reaching unconditional love—love that has no price tag on it, which can be a healing, creative energy.” 
• BILLY GRAHAM, on the job Jimmy Carter is doing as 
President: "I like the sym­ bolic gestures. I like the reli­ gious gestures. But I think ifs too early to assess the substance of this administra­ tion.” 
• SAMMY DAVIS JR ., on his life: " I ’ve survived losing an eye in a car crash, bouts with drugs and booze, a change of religion, some gigantic ego trips, two bad m arriages, a certain President I support­ ed, and a handful of lousy movies. I could say I did it my way, but I believe that line belongs to someone else.” 

The Star strikes again: Six famous females get with the Farrah look 

THE Farrah Fawcett cut is the hottest hair style in America. Farrah-haired females are everywhere these days — but is the White 
House ready for this? Trick photographer 
Alfred Gescheidt gave six famous women 
Farrah’s look. Can you tell who they are? 

OUR second famous female shouldn’t be hard to guess, but if you’re having trouble we’ll share a little hint with you: Ste has a partner who is Sonny, and a son who is Blue. When you have the answer, sing out, “ I’ve got you, babe,” and go on to the next photograph. 

Robert Redford enjoys his New York privacy 

NEW YORK has never been a city fazed by famous faces. Stars are a dime a dozen in the city that is always going broke. Case in point: Mammoth, colossal, cinema-superstar Robert (All 
The President’s Men) Redford, 4o 
Redford keeps his movie idol body in shape by jogging in Central 
Park near his New York apartment (photo at right). The only people who ever seem to notice are the tourists. 
Said Redford: "New York is one (rf the few places where I can just be a private citizen like everyone else. I can go jogging and not be bothered.” 
Redford’s current project is a film based on the best-selling novel titled appropriately, Ordinary People. 
Life’s fortunes amaze Ann-Margret 

SHE S been just about everything else one woman could hope to be: A First Lady, a billionaire’s bride. 
Why not a fling as a 
Farrah, too? Geseheidt’s photo plays a trick. 
Is our fake-Farrah-haired female the world- famous mom, or the world-famous daughter? 

CALL them the Farrah Fawcett and 
Lee Majors of the champagne set. 
Beautiful actress Ann-Margret, 35, and her actor-husband Roger Smith, 
43, looked like at least $6 million at the opening of her latest film, Joseph 
Andrews, a bawdy English classic in the style of Tom Jones. Ann-Margret, 

 once an Illinois high school cheer­ leader, still finds her elegant new whirl a little bit dizzying. 
Said Ann-Margret: "If you'd told me ten years ago that I’d be playing 
18th Century Restoration comedy with a British accent and all-English cast, I’d have said you were crazy.” 

For Roy Clark, simple isn’t so simple today 

ROY CLARK’s rise to the top as a country- and-westem singer, picker, comedian, and 
Hee Haw test apparently changed his defini­ tion of the word "sim ple.” Said the 43-year- old Clark: "A s I get older, I find myself long­ ing to do simple things like cooking, or play­ ing a game of baseball in a corner lot.” 
It sounds like a down-home country boy talking, but when Clark says "cooking,” he means a new line of pre-cooked, frozen, weight-control meals marketed with his pic­ ture on the package. And when he says "a game of baseball in a comer lot,” he means his just-purchased 
Tulsa 
Drillers minor league team in a 6,ooo-seat park. Rounding out his simple life, Clark is a pilot, photogra­ pher, rancher, and race terse fan.

Can you see behind the Fawcett-Majors mane and tell who they are? 

MRS. Hilton-Wilding-Todd-Fisher-Burton-Bur- ton-Warner can out-hyphen Farrah. But what would she look like in a Fawcett-Majors mane? Of course, it just never would happen. 
All that flying, flamboyant hair would hide the flamboyant Taylor-made diamonds. 

BE Reasonerable. This is no way to bring the ratings up. With all the fair hair flying around the ABC News studio, we ll get lisps and wisps mixed up. Do what they did on Mary 
Tyler Moore. Fire the producers and hire Ted 
Baxter, then give Ted the Farrah look. 

IT was nothing like the Pedemales, the little Texas river Lyndon Johnson made famous. But 
Lady Bird Johnson. 64, and Luci Baines Johnson Nuggent, 29, enjoyed themselves just the same on a 1,ooo-mile trip up the Nile. Said Luci, back in Texas after the three-week journey: 
“ It was an exhilarating and enlightening crash course in the wonders of Egypt.” Added Lady 
Bird: “ It was a marvelous combination—exploring ancient Egypt and watching modern Egypt glide by.” Vacation over. Lady Bird went back to her job running the LBJ Library in Austin.

I/Guise Lasser 

IF TV’s Mary Hartman ever decides to solve her soap opera woes by murder, she can take a page out of the real Mary 
Hartman’s book. 
The real Mary Hartman is a 
Ph.D. at Rutgers, and has just had a book published, Victori­ an 
Murderesses 
(Schocken 
Press, $15), that describes the gory details of how certain 
19th 
Century 
English and 
French women did away with those who bothered them. 
Said Dr. Mary Hartman: 
“ Louise Lasser playing the role of Mary' Hartman conveys the sense that life is out of con­ trol. This is a sensation that 
• many women have had for a long, long time. My book looks at the extreme ways some women have dealt with this problem in the past.” 
Dr. Mary Hartman writes about Murder.

Saccharin ban is a ratty idea 
WHEN the government moved to ban saccharin sales, Rep. An­ drew Jacobs (D-Ind., above) saw the problem as one of rights, not cancerous rats. 
Said the Congressman: “ Ifs the job of government not only to protect the public health, but also to protect the public free­ dom when it is threatened by mindless application of bureau­ cratic rules. Without saccharin, the only freedom some people have is to be fat.” 
Rep. Jacobs’ tongue-in-cheek solution is put warnings on sac­ charin: “The Canadians have determined sacharin is danger­ ous to your rat’s health.” Jacobs also has introduced a bill to ban the ban. He is calling it the “ Un- 
Crazying of Federal Regulations 
Act Of 1977.” mtiur-' JSSlNisSiaSSHaa**. 

Rape vktlms are preparing a list of all sex et fenders 

A SECRET band of women vigi­ lantes is planning to publish the names of ail sex offenders in ma­ jor U.S. cities. 

The women, many of them rape victims, have already distributed 
25,ooo copies of a tabloid in Dal­ las, Tex., listing all indicted sex offenders in that city from 196o through 1976. 
Similar publications are being prepared in four other major ci­ ties. Plans are also under way to blanket the nation with publica­ tion of names of local men indict­ ed for rape and other sex crimes. 
The Dallas list of more than ly 
6oo names contained not only con­ victed rapists, but men who were acquitted by a jury, men whose cases were dismissed and men who have pending trials. 
The list was published in a 
2o-page tabloid widely distributed in Dallas shopping centers and areas frequented by singles. 
Women were urged to post the lists in singles bars, apartment complexes and laundries. 
The tabloid is entitled Kitty 
Genovese Women’s Project, after the 28 year-old woman who was stabbed to death in Queens, New 
York, in 1964, while neighbors ig­ nored her cries for help. 
The group behind the project has remained extremely secre­ tive. 
The publication lists no names of staff members. The only mailing address given is: Kitty 
Genovese Women’s Project, 31o 
5th Ave., Suite 3o1, New York 
City, 1ooo1. 
The address is that of a conven­ ience mailing firm which for­ wards mail. The owner of the firm refused to give out any infor­ mation concerning clients. 
The only woman who worked on the project, and who has agreed to speak publicly, is Charlotte 
Taft, who did the graphics for the publication. 
She told THE STAR: “ Our pur­ pose is to educate the public about rape, to give people an idea of what rape really is. The list is meant to be used as a reference. 
“ If a woman is concerned about a particular person, she can go down to the Hall of Records and double-check to make sure there isn’t a mistake because of a simi­ lar name.” 
Miss Taft said that one reason the project workers wish to re­ main anonymous is because they fear reprisals. 
* 
Another project worker told 
THE STAR she could not identify the four cities where similar pub­ lications are being prepared be­ cause of possible danger to field workers who are gathering court records in those cities. 

FINLAND FACES A 
HOCKEY PENALTY 
THE federal government may take action against Finland for dumping its hockey sticks on the

Treasury officials are investi­ gating whether the imported sticks, worth about $2 million alone last year, are being sold to 
American buyers at unfairly low prices.

Claudine with her sons, Bobby, left, and Christian: She flew to Mexico without telling them. 

By BOB BOYD 

CLAUDINE 
Longet has burned her famous — but top secret — love diary 
THE 
STAR learned this week. 

The diary contained references to her love life and passages on her innermost thoughts and feel­ ings. 

But 
M iss 
Longet preserved some of its intim ate contents for possible use in a book she is writ­ ing. 
T h e diary was a m ajor issue in the trial in which Miss Longet was convicted of killing her ski star-lover Spider Sabich. 

D istrict Attorney Frank Tuck­ er, who prosecuted the case in As­ pen, Colo., said: “ A lot of people in Hollywood will be relieved to know she has burned the diary. 

“ It contained a Tot of names, and lawyers were getting worried calls when it was thought the diary was going to be read in court.” 

Tucker said justice would have been better served had the con­ tents of the diary been revealed to jurors. But the judge ruled it was not admissible. 

Tucker, who has refused to dis­ close any of the diary’s contents, said: “ She has copied portions of the diary which she thinks she will need for the book, but the ac­ tual diary was burned several weeks ago.” 
Tucker confirm ed that one pas­ sage in the diary dealt with Miss 
Longers concern that her affair with Sabich was ending. 
The 35-year-old ex-wife of sing­ er Andy W illiam s wrote: “ Spider 

Claudine and daughter Noelle: She and her children are staying in 
Aspen, Colo., though the residents hate her. 

Bvt she copied out some passages for an intimate book she plans to write 

 didn’t say how beautiful I am this m orning.” 

A girlfriend of Spider’s brother 
Steve, who asked not to be named, told THE STA R: 
“ The diary continued with a description of Claudine taking a long walk and worrying whether her beauty was fading with age.” 
Tu cker confirmed this passage. 
Claudine, who has yet to serve her 3o-day prison sentence for Sa­ bich’s death, now m akes regular trips to a sm all fishing village in 
Mexico where she is working on the book. She travels with the

Woman says rocks reveal hidden secrets of the future 

ASTROLOGY buffs think the fu­ ture is in the stars, but M arlena 
Heidt says it’s really in rocks. 
Marlena, who is also known as 
The Rock Lady, says rocks talk to her. And they have told her that the world is in for some rocky times. 
Based on % the information she says she’s received from rocks, 
Marlena is predicting that: 

• The United States and Russia will become allies in a nuclear war with China. 
• A worldwide fam ine will oc­ cur within the next five years and will teach us to tuni deserts into lush farm land. 
• President Carter will em erge as one of our greatest presidents for directing us through these troubled tim es. 

“ I receive vibrations from rocks,” M arlena told THE STAR. 
“ They act as a sort of receiving station for all sorts of impressions floating about freely, I m erely tap the rocks, so to speak, and they release what they've stored.” 
Marlena predicted the downfall of Richard Nixon a year before he resigned and .she foresaw his seri­ ous illness She also forecast^ the. 
“decfeitjR o f’ Jld im y ^ f t e f while Tit 

 was just considering running for 
President. 
“ I guess a lot of people at the time thought I literally had rocks in my head,” Marlena said. 

R eceiving impressions from rocks is not a new phenomenon, she insists. 
- 
“ It predates written history. 
Ancient Egyptians and Hebrews used the technique. So did the 
American Indians long before Co­ lumbus arrived here.” 
Marlena claim s various stones have different powers. Some fo­ cus on health, others on the fu­ ture. 
“ I suppose it all has something to do with the types of m inerals in the rocks. Some rocks work well for some people but not for oth­ e rs.” 
Glass and plastic stones do not possess any powers, she reported. 
But, M arlena added, rocks and stones do not have to be precious or valuable to possess great pow­ ers. 
Marlena said it should surprise no one that rocks possess m ystic powers. 
•‘.After all, they’re the oldest 
„ things on E arth and the closest things on this planet to God.” 

Marlena Heidt: Sees a nuclear war with China in the near future. 

 consent of her probation officer, 
32-year-old Terry Norris. 

“ I see her once a month at her home in 
Aspen,” 
Norris said. 
“ Som etim es I contact her by tele­ phone. When she goes away, she does so with my consent.” 

Miss Longet, who was placed on two years probation at the sam e time as she received the 
3o-day jail term , is refusing to dis­ cuss the diary or her future plans. 

When a STAR reporter visited her at home in Aspen, Miss Lon­ get appeared at the door clad in a short, white night gown with her 
7-year-old son, Bobby. 

Looking pale and haggard, she said: “ I am not talking. I am not giving any interview s.” 

D istrict Attorney Frank Tucker said: “ A lot of people wonder why she stays on in Aspen where ev­ erybody hates her. I think the an­ swer lies in that book. 

“ She started working on it with­ in hours of walking away from the court. She flew down to Mexico and didn't even tell her kids she was going. She stays here because she needs m aterial.”

Her secret love 

Elvis-fat, feisty and 42-fears he’s losing his sex appeal, says psychologist He fights middle- V 

By STEVE DUNLEAVY 

ELVIS PRESLEY, fat and 42, but still adored by millions, is on a collision course with the crisis that strikes us all—middle age. 
Like most men his age. he is battling the bulge, trying desperately to keep up a youthful appearance and, says a psycholo­ gist, is unsure of his sex appeal. 
But his worst enemies are the same as those faced by many men—a bad diet and boredom with the job. 
These problems are taking their toll on his personal life. 
Presley, once the model of humility, has become a demanding recluse. 
Last month, according to Bill Hance* a columnist for the Nashville, Tenn. Banner. 
Elvis fired a gunshot in the air during an argument with his girlfriend. Ginger Al­ den. 
“ She had threatened to leave Elvis at 
Graceland (his mansion) in Memphis,” said Hance. “ Elvis appeared at the door in an angry mood, fired a shot in the air and she returned to the house.” 
When he went to Nashville to make a re­ cording at RCA he kept musicians waiting for three days. 
Instead of going to the recording, Elvis locked himself away at the Sheraton South 
Motor Inn. He told the recording studio he had a bad cold, left Nashville without re­ cording a note and left the musicians with­ out so much as an apology. 
He then re-scheduled the recording ses­ sion in his racquetball court at Graceland. 
But afterwards when he played back the recording on his sound equipment, he be­ came annoyed and threatened to blow out the system* with a gun. 
His ballooning girth is also depressing him. In Florida recently he was up to 23o pounds, nearly 6o pounds heavier than his once trim 175-pound frame. But it’s little wonder. 
For breakfast, which is usually served around 5 p.m. Elvis eats four eggs, four servings of crisp bacon, coffee and jelly donuts. 
From then until he goes to bed at 4 a m. the next day, he is constantly snacking on the most fattening of foods. His favorite is banana-and-peanut-butter sandwiches, fried in butter. 
He alternates that with hamburgers, whipped potatoes, gravy, grilled sandwich­ es, pork chops, ice cream and the ever present jelly donuts. 
Presley’s personal physician, Dr. George 
Nichopoulos, who has just returned from 
Hawaii with the singer, told THE STAR: 
“ His food has plenty of nutrition in it. Ifs just that he eats too much of it. 
“ It is like some people who drink too much beer. They don’t have the discipline to stop. 
“ Elvis is human like anyone else. He sometimes finds it a little hard to keep up the discipline. 
“ He has eaten junk food before. But we’ve tried to get him off it. Right now, he’s on a diet .and he is going to be in great shape.” 
Nutritionist Dr. Irwin Di Cayan. who wrote the best-selling book on nutrition. 
Without Prescription, is not as optimistic as Dr. Nichopoulos. 
"Junk food cuts off nutrition." he said. 
“ All that rubbish can seriously affect the health. 
‘ ‘That kind of food and diet can go on for 
IO years and then a person who eats it can just drop dead. Ifs as serious as that.” 
Behavioral psychologist Dr. William V an 
Precht of New Vork, says he understands the syndrome he is going through. 
“ Like any man of that age, Presle would tend toward depression,” he sai

“He is probably unsure of his sex appeal, which would be made worse by the fact that he almost certainly equates sex ap­ peal with success. 
“ The weight problem is bad for his self- image, although many of his fans might not care. Ifs bad for Presley because it changes his own mental attitude. 
“The point is that this is not rare at all in people of that age. The syndrome is of­ ten that a man like Presley must strive to maintain his relationship with younger girls. 
“Only younger women can keep him young because he feels half his life is over and he is in his declining years, and ifs all downhill from now on.” 
Some of the girls Elvis dates today are at least 15 years younger than he is. But when he first made it big 2o years ago, they were all about his own age—Natalie 
Wood, Juliet Prowse, Hope Lange, Tues­ day Weld, Ann-Margret, Anita Wood. 
But in 1959 he lost interest in all of them when he met 15-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu in Germany. 
He brought her back to Memphis and married her in 1967, 
That marriage ended in divorce five years later, the same year Elvis met for­ mer Miss Tennessee, Linda Thompson. 
She was only 21 at the time and since then he’s had four serious romances. 
One of them was 21-year-old Diana 
Goodman, a former Miss Georgia that

Presley lavished with rings and necklaces. 
Then there was 22-year-old Sheila Ryan, a petite blonde who is now married to James 
Caan. 
Next was 19-year-old Malessa Black­ wood, a Memphis beauty queen who Is a senior at the university of Alabama. 
Now ifs Ginger Alden, a southern beau­ ty of 23 who Elvis has kept as his constant companion, although he still sees Linda frequently. But Elvis’ interest in younger 

 women is not the only thing bringing cont­ roversy in-to his life. Already, there have been rumblings that his career has peaked and that he is turning in indifferent perfor­ mances. 
Author Ralph Pearl, who writes for the 
Las Vegas Sun, said: “ Elvis is putting in performances as if he is bored. 
“ He gets up there and sings maybe half a dozen songs and then spends the rest of the show talking to the audience or goofing oft with the band 
Presley fans gave the entertainer a hys­ terical reception, though, when he ap­ peared recently in Palm Beach and St. Pe­ tersburg, Fla. His weight problem was very evident at the time. 
And officials at the hotels where he stayed, reported Elvis maintained a wacky diet. 
. i 
“ I was kept up until five in the morning, just in case Mr. Presley wanted anything special,” said Mark Genova, hotel chef at the West Palm Beach Sheraton 
‘But all he ate was Spanish omelettes. 
“ Ifs not an exciting diet, but no wonder with the amount of eggs he eats he has a weight problem.” " 
Richard Wingfield, manager of the hotel, said Elvis stayed in a four-bedroom suite the whole time-he was in West Palm Beach except when he went out to give his con­ cert. 
At Elvis’ next stop. St Petersburg, Kir­ by Payne, a manager of the Downtown Hil­ ton Inn, said: “ We had to make sure the television was working at all times and that there w as no chance of a breakdow n ” 
Also, Payne said, “There was at least IO times as much linen delivered to his suite than a normal guest. That is so a maid would never have to disturb him.” 
Payne said Elvis’ diet consisted of ham­ burger, cottage cheese, baked potatoes, ice cream and soft drinks. 
But hamburgers are his main passion, 
Payne added. 
That passion is such that Nigel Winfield, a pilot who once sold Presley his $1.2 mil­ lion Convair, said: “We have flown from 
Memphis to Dallas just to get a hamburg­ er. Elvis is convinced that Dallas is the only town that can make a decent ham­ burger. Hp loves them.”

The course is never exact and the rules allow a player to drop out whenever he wishes. 
It is such a game of skill, there are few winners. The object of the game is never quite clear — thereby enticing the players. 
A joker is always part of the game, yet it is a game of strategy. You can win on each end, but one of the objects is to hold mid­ dle ground. The longer you can do so, the more interesting the game.

Behind the new split: Cher is giving Gregg one more

WW 

Cher arrives in Los Angeles with Chastity, at the start of her cross­ country concert tour with ex-husband Sonny Bono. 

CHER is giving husband 
Gregg 
Allman one more chance to straighten himself out, say friends close to the couple in Hollywood. 
That's why she filed for a sepa­ ration rather than a divorce ... a last-ditch attem pt to hold their volatile m arriage together. 

The singer, who is currently on a nightclub and theater tour with ex-husband Sonny and his girl­ friend Suzie Coehio, confesses she 
«s still in love with the former leader of the Allman Brothers 
Band. 
“ But because of his band orien­ tated lifestyle and drug and drinking problems, she finds it difficult to live with him," said one friend. 
“She will tour for six months and at the end of that time hope that Gregg has settled down or got out o r ler life. 
“There is no doubt they love each other, but like many couples 

By IVOR KEY 

 cannot live together unless one of them changes. And it s not going to be Cher. 
“ She feels her duty lies prim ar­ ily with little Elijah Blue and 
Chastity and wants them to grow up in a normal household. 
“Cher went to court after months of cajoling and pleading as the last step and to show Gregg she would go through with her threat to leave him ." 
While Cher is on tour. Gregg is commuting between their $5oo,ooo mansion in Beverly Hills and Buf­ falo, N Y. where he is receiving treatment in an attem pt to get off drink and drugs. 
Eight-month-old 
Elijah 
Blue and seven-year-old 
Chastity, 
Cher's daughter by Sonny, are being looked after at her m other’s home by a nanny. 
Ifs not the first time the couple has split since they wed in 1975— 

Before the break-up: Cher gets a hug from Gregg All- man. Now he's got only one more chance. 
Cher and Gregg strolling home after a shopping expedition: “ She loves him, but finds it difficult to live with him,” a friend revealed. 

First aid for brujsed fruit 

UNIVERSITY researchers have developed an apparatus to mea­ sure how' much force it takes to bruise an apple. 
The instrument, designed at 
West Virginia University's Col­ lege of Agriculture and Forestry will help determine when a fruit is ready for harvest, the effect of storage on fruit, and which fruit varieties should be planted based on their ability to resist bruising. 
Much of the information also is used in designing mechanical fruit harvesting equipment. 

GARDEN OF EDEN WAS A SPACESHIP 
THE Garden of Eden was really a spaceship that crash-landed on earth about 6.ooo years ago. a leading physicist claimed this week. 
The crash occurred near a 
Stone Age community in the Mid­ dle East, said Dr. Irwin Ginsburg. a physicist with Standard Oil of 
Indiana. 
“ The Bible says that the G ar­ den of Eden had everything need­ ed to support life for two people and at its center was the tree of knowledge,” he added. “ It doesn t say it was actually a garden. 
“ I think the tree of knowledge 

- AUTHOR 

 was a device like a computer, and this was the central control for the space ship. 

“God sent Adam and Eve to this planet from the constellation 
Pleiades,” added Dr. Ginsburg, who bases his theories on refer­ ences in the Bible and the Tal­ mud. 

Dr. Ginsburg outlines his theory in his book First Man, Then Adam 
(Simon and Schuster, $5.95). 
He believes that the original 

 outer space dwellers were bisex­ ual. 
“ They were connected at the ribs, like Siamese twins," he said. 
“ This is why they say Eve was made from Adam’s rib 
“ Separating Adam and Eve into heterosexuals prepared them to mate, so their children could crossbreed with the earth people. 
Dr. Ginsburg believes his theo­ ries solve the long standing theo­ logical question of where Adam’s sons found wives. 
“ Naturally, they mated with Stone Age wom­ en, descendents of the evolution­ ary process," he said. 

 three days after Cher's divorce from Sonny. 
The first break-up cam e when she and Gregg had been m arried only nine days. She filed for di­ vorce, but later had it dismissed. 
Then Gregg sued Cher for di­ vorce, but also had it dropped. 
The first hint that something was wrong this tim e cam e when 
Cher, who at 3o is two years older than Gregg, decided to go on tour with Sonny. 
When Sonny set off for Honolulu with Suzie he took not only Chasti­ ty, but Elijah Blue with him. And 
Cher joined them later. 
“ She didn’t want to leave the baby behind with G regg." said the friend. “ She wants custody and intends to keep him with her or her family until that m atter is settled. 
“ Cher is determined that if things don’t change in the next few weeks the separation will be perm anent." 
Just before the latest break-up, 
Cher talked frankly about her re­ lationship with Gregg—how she loved him and how she feared him. 
“ I’m not afraid of Gregory in the sam e way that I w'as afraid of 
Sonny," she said. 
“I’m more afraid of Gregory in one way because I’m so emotion­ ally attached to him. I’m so open to him. 
“ I’ve left myself so open to be really pounced on if he was in­ clined to do that. 
“ I also think that he never would really hurt me in any way.” 
Of her m arriage, she said at the time: “Gregory is incredible. It s been like two years for us just tearing each other down so we could really see what the hell was there. So much hiding, you know. 
“ tie s really intelligent, he's very friendly, very open, he’s not confining at all. He's also very jealous. Sonny was also very jeal­ ous, but Gregg’s not so confining. 
“ His jealousy doesn’t m anifest itself in try ing to really keep you under a clamp so that nobody can see you.” 
Cher also adm itted that Gregg doesn't like her doing the show with Sonny: “ He doesnt really feel comfortable with it. 
He doesn’t like the idea I’m working with Sonny. 
“ He doesn’t really mind Sonny but he doesn’t like the idea, and 
I don’t blame him, that America still thinks of Sonny and Cher. So it s very difficult for him to watch the Sonny And Cher Show.” 
Cher denied that she was the cause of the break-up of the All- man Brothers Band. 
“ Well, I really had nothing to do with breaking up the band," she said. “ I really had to do with straightening out Gregory . And if that broke up the band then I’m glad. 
“ I would do it again at a mo­ m ent’s notice because I think thai saving Gregory is much more im­ portant than saving the Allman. 
Brothers,”

IOU GRANT, news director ol 
WJM-TV was aghast. “You want me to evaluate Ted?” he repeated, grip­ ping the phone as if about to throttle it. 
Coleman, the new owner of the station, who was al the other end of the phone, was firing people left, right and center. 
Now he was taking a close look at the news department And especially at Ted 
Baxter. 
And Ted didn't bear such close scrutiny. 
After all, what can you say about a guy who thinks the ERA is an Irish terrorist or­ ganization, or that Hurricane C arter is 
Jimmy’s brother? 
Lou put Coleman on hold, and tried to pass the buck to producer Mary Richards. 
She passed it right back to him. 
Ted might be the biggest boob ever to hit the boob tube. But no one had the heart to tell that to the new boss. 
Lou switched Coleman back on the line. 
“ You want me to evaluate Ted? Well, er, I think you can judge for yourself how good he is just by looking at the show.” 
“ Oh my God,” sobbed Ted, when Lou told him what he’d said. 
“ Sorry, Ted, but I don t know what I can really do about it now.” 
Ted knew. “ I got it! The simplest thing in the world. When you go to see Coleman, you tell him that if I get fired, you quit!” 
“ Hold it,” protested Lou. 
Ted began to beg. He got on his hands and knees and hobbled toward Lou. “ Hate these small offices,” he muttered. 
“ There s no room to crawl.” 
Lou was unmoved. So Ted got tough. 
“ Lou, I’m calling in my IOUs.” 
"You don’t have any IOUs.” 
“ I have a wife and two kids, Lou .... . please . . . please . . . ”

News, you have to decide where the prob­ lem is. 
“ Is it in front of the cam era, or behind the cam era? It s not exactly a science, but 
I have to go with my instincts. 
“ Ted, you’re staying. And the rest of you guys I’m going to have to let go.” 
Mary, Lou and Murray were stunned, unable to move. They simply stood there speechless. 
Not so, Ted. He strode determinedly for­ ward, leaning belligerently across Cole­ man’s desk. 
“ Just a second, Coleman,” he said, with anger in his voice. “ These people are my iriends. I spent a lot of years with them. 
They mean a lot to me. And a lot more than any job as an anchorman with WJM.” 
“ If I were getting fired, these people were ready to go down the line for me, and it s the least I can do for them. 
“ Either they stay — OR I’M QUIT­ 
TING.” 
The others heard all this with amaze­ ment. They also heard Coleman’s plea to 
Ted: “ I wish you'd reconsider.” But so quick was it, and so quietly whispered, that they didn t hear Ted’s quicksilver re­ ply: “ O K. I’ll stay.” 
B 

HE next morning, Friday, Lou, Mary and news writer Murray Slaughter arrived in Coleman’s office to hear the verdict on the show — and them. Only Ted was missing. 
“ I’m sorry,” said Coleman, “ but we can t wait lor Ted any longer. As you know, I have a big decision to make today 
— one that affects our news program. As much as I hate to do it, I believe that you got to get rid of everything that’s pulling it down.” 
As if on cue, in walked Ted — followed by his wile, his son, his baby — and his dog. 
“ I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Coleman,” said led, but I had a number of personal er­ rands to take care of and I thought this would be a good opportunity to have you meet some of my dependents.” 
Prodded by Ted, his wife Georgette blushingly stumbled into a speech that had all the Ted Baxter hallmarks. “ I hope you don t mind our coming along,” she said sheepishly, “ but we only have the one car, and as soon as we leave here I have to go to the doctor, take the baby to the pediatri­ cian, David to the dentist, and the dog to the vet. Bad back, bad cough, bad teeth . . baaaad dog.” 
Coleman mumbled a “ nice meeting you all,” said there was business to be dis­ cussed, and Ted quickly ushered his family out the door. 
“ As I was saying,” said Coleman when the door had closed, “ when the ratings are as bad as they are on the Six O’clock 

 dismissing some of the staff, did you in­ tend to fire me, too?” 
There was silence as Mary heard Cole­ man’s reply. “ Especially me,” she repeat­ ed quietly. “ I'm very sorry I troubled you.” She hung up the phone and added an­ grily: “ You little runt!” 
A COUPLE of days later Lou Grant came around to M ary's apartment. “ You looked so sad when you left on Friday,” he said, “ that I took some money out of petty cash and bought you a little gift.” 
“ No little gift is going to cheer me up,” said Mary glumly. 
“ Don’t be so sure. Just close your eyes and, like Tinkerbell, I'm going to wave my wand.” 
Mary closed her eyes. Lou opened her front door — and in stepped Mary’s old 

ACK in the newsroom, Mary, I^ou and Murray console each other, while Ted bounces around trying to look distraught. 
Murray was still mulling over Ted’s sur­ prise gesture. “ It was a terrific speech you made up there, Ted.” 
“ You think so, Murray? Gee, I thought you d be mad ’cause I didnt quit too.’ 
“ Naw, that s O.K., Ted. When a donkey flies, you don’t blame him for not staying up there that long.” 
“ Thanks, Murray. I know you’re trying to let me down easy,” said Ted, turning somberly to Mary and Lou. 
“ You know what I d love to say to you all?” he said. “ I’d love to say don’t worry about money. Whatever you need, I’ll give you.’ . . . But I can t say it.” 
He screwed up his face. “ What’s wrong with my emotions? Is there nothing behind this handsome facade except talent?” 
MARY was looking pensive. “ You know what I’m thinking, M urray?” she said slowly. “ I know this is going to sound silly 
. . . but I’m not sure I was fired. 
“ No, really. Think about it. Mr. Coleman did say very clearly: ‘Ted is staying and 
I'm afraid I’m going to have to let the rest of you GUYS go.’ 
"Now I’m not a guy. Well, I’m not, I m not. And I was just thinking that maybe he was em barrassed to tell me that I’m stay­ ing — in front of you.” 
Mary picked up the phone and dialed. 
The new boss came on the line. “ Hello,

“ Hey, don’t worry,” protested Mary. 
“ I’m going to be O K. We’re going to have a terrific time. What do you want to do?”

N MONDAY night, their last night at 
WJM, Mary, Lou and Murray stood around the newsroom TV set as Ted came to the end of the news . . . 
“ Now a personal note. Due to some very good opportunities that have opened up elsewhere, 
News 
Director Lou Grant, 
News Producer Mary Richards, News 
Writer Murray Slaughter, and Newshen 
Sue Ann Nivens are going to leave after to­ 

 night’s program to begin exciting new ven­ tures in broadcasting. 
“ Last night, as I lay awake in my bed, I wondered: How do I tell these dear friends and colleagues how I feel about them? 
How, I wondered, do you speak from here 
[pointing to his heart J instead of from here 
[pointing to his mouth]. 
“ Well, I finally got an idea up here 
[pointing to his head]. Finally the words came to me. I put them down on paper. I put them in here [pointing to his pocket].” 
“ I think,” said Murray, “ I’m going to be sick here [pointing to his stom ach].” 
On the screen, Ted got to the point: 
“ I think what I was feeling was best ex­ pressed in the lyrics of that wonderful old song — It s a long way to Tipperary. It’s a long way to go. 
“This is Ted Baxter saying Good night and good news .” 
Murray flicked off the set: "You know, 
I’m never going to forget what Ted said to­ night — but I’m sure as hell gonna try.” 
Ted bounded in, full of enthusiasm. 
“ Hey, guys, wasn't that a great send-off?” 
Murray replied with a sneer: “ Ted, you couldn’t have said anything that would make us feel better about leaving.” 

Mary, who had been fighting back tears, turned to Lou Grant. “ You know, Mr. 
Grant, now that it s over, I don’t feel as bad as I thought I was going to. In fact, I feel pretty good. I really do.” 

“ What’s the m atter?” said Lou angrily. 
“ You got icewater in your veins? Do you realize this is the last time we’ll all see this room.” 
M■ARY started to break up: “ Of course 
I realize it, Mr. Grant. I don’t really feel good. That’s why I wanted to say to you. . .” 
Lou quickly realized Mary was about to get sentimental. “ Mary, you promised.” 
“ Mr. Grant why won t you let me say what I want to say?” 
“ Because you'll just make a big deal out of it, and I don't want that. 
“ Let s make this simple. In case I don I see you again 
I’d just like to say . 
He chokes back a sob . . . “ so long. 
Mary moved tenderly into Lou’s open arm s and started sobbing. Murray put his arms around both of them, sobbing too. 
Sue Ann joined in. So did Ted himself, sob­ bing louder than anyone. They formed a giant sobbing huddle. 
“ I think we all need some Kleenex,” said Lou, sniffing. 
“There s some on M ary’s desk,” said 
Georgette. Without letting go of each oth­ er, they shuffled crablike over to Mary’s desk to the Kleenex. 
Mary sniffled: “ Mr. Grant, could I say what I wanted to say now? Please.” 
“O.K., Mary.” 
“ Well, I just wanted you to know that sometimes I get concerned about being a career woman. I get to thinking my job is too important to me. 
“ And then I tell myself that the people 
I work with are just the people I work with and not my family. 
“ And last night I thought What is a fam­ ily, anyway? They’re just people who make you feel less alone and really loved’. 
“ And that’s what you’ve done for me. 
Thank you for being my family.” 
With that, she burst into tears again. 
Lou brought her back to earth again. 
“ How,” he said, “ do we leave this room9” 
He thought for a minute: “ That’s not so hard. Remember what Ted said?” 
“ What is that, Lou?” asked Ted. 
Lou began singing: “ It’s a long way to 
Tipperary, it’s a long way to" go.” 
Joining in. Mary, Murray, Ted and Sue 
Ann shuffled toward the newsroom door. 
And still in a huddle, they left. For the last time. 

Orphan boys get 
Second Chance at building a life 

BOYS whose parents didn't take care of them are learning to take care of themselves in a town called Second Chance. 
The Old VV est-sty Ie town isn’t finished yet. The boys, aged 11-15, are building it. 
Russ and Florence Futter house and feed the youngsters on their 
Mile High Ranch WI miles west of 
Los Angeles, Calif. 
While living at the ranch, the boys — all abandoned by their parents — work on Second 
Chance, which will have a Wells 
Fargo office, country store, livery stable, hotel and assay office. 
Besides crafts they learn build­ ing Second Chance, the boys are taught to grow food and breed an­ imals. They also attend local ele­ mentary and high schools. 
Referred to the Futters by wel­ fare workers, the boys spend a year at the ranch. The Futters keep only six youngsters at a time. 

HOW TO GET RICH, KY THE 
SECRETARY WHOU 
SOON BE WORTH SIM 

A FORMER secretary who de­ cided to get rich, and did, is telling America’s women how they can become wealthy. 
Paula Nelson, 31, bases her advice on her own success. She expects to be a millionaire within two years. 
“My next book will sell for six figures,” she told THE STAR, 
“i’m negotiating a TV show. I’ve got a regular financial column and I have my own seminar arri consulting business.” 
Paula’s current bestseller. The 
Joy Of Money (Bantam paper­ back, $1.95), is selling 17,ooo c o d - ies-a-day and sales have already reached a quarter of a million. 

The first step for women in earn­ ing and accumulating money is improving their self-confidence about money matters, according to Paula. 
“Women are especially afraid of money,” die said. “The educa­ tional system has done much of the damage. Women are intimi­ dated by math. I was. ” 
Paula dropped out of college with a C average at 19. and went to work as a secretary. Idle learned she loved the world of business. 
By asking questions of the busi­ nessmen around her, studying and applying what she learned, she made a killing on a stock option. 
“By the time I was 21, I was a 
After taming lions, geese are easy 

JIM Parsons used to tame a pride of lions. Now he trains a gaggle of geese 
Parsons quit his lion-taming act with a circus (top) to become a saloon-keeper. Then a customer bet him be couldn’t train a goose to sit (Mi an egg. Parsons won. 
Within three weeks, he had sev­ eral clacking farmyard geese not only sitting on eggs but see-saw- ing, jumping hurdles and walking a tightrope He used the same techniques he had used on the bons. 
Since then, he and his geese have Taised several hundred dol­ lars for charities in his home county of Somerset, England. 
Parsons says the geese are easy to train, but dumb. Their atten­ tion span, he said, is about IO minutes. 

Paula Nelson vice president on the board of di­ rectors of a major company,” she said. 
She insists other women can du­ plicate her success. Nothing in lier background, she says, pre­ pared her to be a financial wiz­ ard. Her father was a builder and the family was not wealthy. 
And, she said, she made the same mistakes about money early in her life that many women con­ tinue making. 
“When I started earning a sala­ ry, I quickly spent it because I didn t -Know what to do with it,” sltje said. 
“Most people don’t know how to deal with money so they get rid of it on gadgets, cars, clothes and other things they don’t need.” 
Also, she said, women are con­ ditioned to believe being too smart about money will damage their relationships. 
“Women are afraid of financial equality.” she said. “They fear it will cheat their man of his mascu­ linity — that at the bottom line, they’ll lose him.” 
Women who want a financial life of their own must get rid of traditional negative self-images about money, Paula said. 
“They have got to say to them­ selves they deserve to be finan­ cially solvent,” she said. 
“And that’s hard to do because most women fear they won't get the man if they have money.” single and attractive, her own life her fi- 
Pauia, says that in nancial independence is a help ro­ mantically, not a hindrance. 
“There’s nothing like that kind of equality.” she said. “You can really care for each other in an honest way. 
“Now that I’m rich, people ask if I’m not into rich men. 
“I say no — but no matter whom I fall in love with, I can teach them to make money.” 
This won’t be necessary if Pau­ la should marry the man with whom she s had a longtime rela­ tionship. His career, also, is in fi­ nance.

Nine ways to negotiate a raise 

IF YOUR knees shake when you ask for a raise, take money wiz­ ard Paula Nelson's advice and in­ ventory your assets. 
Here are Paula’s tips for not only asking for a raise, but get­ ting it: 
• KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH. 
Before you approach your boss, put yourself in his sloes. Ask yourself such questions as how valuable you are to the firm, how modi it would cost in time and money to replace you, whether and bow easily you could get a job elsewhere, and what you have done lately to help the company. 
• PICK YOUR PLACE. If pos­ sible, get your boss outside his of­ fice to listen to your request. Psy­ chologically, this puts you on a more equal footing with him. If possible, take him to lunch. 
• DEFINE YOUR REASONS. 
Just telling your boss you want a raise isn’t enough. You must say 
WHY you deserve one. If you find this difficult to do face-to-face, write out your reasons and give them to him. 
• SUGGEST AN AMOUNT, 
You, not your boss, should pro­ pose the amount of your passible raise. You might back up your figure by saying it’s been offered to you by another company. But be careful with this ploy; it can ala) get you fired. An alternate approach is to let him hear through a third party — his sece- tary, maybe — that you’ve been offered more money by another finn. 
• SET YOUR FIGURE HIGH, 
Ask for more than you expect to get. This leaves you room to bar­ gain. 
• COMPROMISE — BUT NOT 
TOO EASILY. Since you’ve start­ ed with a high figure, realize you probably won’t get it. So let you* boss make a counter-offer, and be ready to compromise. 
You’ll probably want to settle some­ where between your figure amt his. But when you reach the point of agreeing on a final figure, give yourself time to think it over. Re­ member, once you accept it, you’re stuck with it. Going back on your word and trying to re­ open negotiations once they’re closed discredits you. 
• REHEARSE. Don’t go into the negotiations cold. Bounce your arguments off a friend play­ ing the part of your boss. And be sure ycm’re in top mental and physical condition when the ac­ tual talks with your boss begin. J 
• GET IT IN WRITING. If pos­ sible, get your boss to put. in writ­ ing — for both your signatures — the raise he agrees to. 
• DON’T WAIT - ASK. Don’t wait around for the company to recognize your value and give you a raise when you deserve one. 
Ask for it. Many bosses will see this as a sign of an aggressive spirit that is an asset to the com­ pany. 

Dangerous gerbils 
BEWARE of gerbils with dan­ druff. says Dr. Raymond Slav in, an internist at St. l.ouis Univer­ sity. Mo. 
He told a meeting in Miami that gerbil owners can develop an al­ lergy to the dandruf with symp­ toms including! fever and breath­ ing difficulties.

SPORTS CARS 

By CHARLES BROWN and DONNA LAWSON 

AMERICA is renewing its love affair with the automobile. 
Industry analysts estimate automakers will deliver about ll million new ears in 
1977 _ a stunning recovery from the 8.5 million sold in recession year 1975. 
This week, for readers interested in roll­ ing on new wheels, THE STAR looks at 5o new models — from a man s and a wom­ an's point of view. 
Reporter Donna Lawson, far from being concerned only with seat covers and color combinations, was especially interested in vans and light trucks. 
She reflected a growing trend among 
U.S. motorists. Nationwide, the best-selling vehicles today are the Chevy and Ford pickups. 
Donna’s colleague, Charles Brown, was more interested in small, sporty models. 
Both reporters found good buys in all sizes of cars. 
Outstanding were domestic small cars. 
Easier on gas and cheaper to maintain, these subcompacts and compacts also boast good discounts — as much as 15 per­ cent below sticker prices. 
Prices listed for the models below are base sticker prices. Options such as power steering, automatic transmission and air conditioning can add several hundred dol­ lars but they also add value when the car is re-sold. 
Mileage ratings are U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates. 
SUBCOMPACTS 

AMC GREMLIN 

Price. $2995 
MPG: 2o city, 27 highway 
HIM: This odd little car is the lowest- priced auto built in America. You must be careful flinging it around curves, since the 
Gremlin is extremely front-heavy. But if you’re put off by other sub-compacts be­ cause of their light weight, consider it. The 
Gremlin weighs 28o2 pounds. 
HER: I don’t think it’s cute; I think it’s clumsy. But there is plenty of room for front seat occupants. It feels like a larger car than it is. 
BUICK QPEL-ISUZU 4-DOOR 

 other small cars. Although it doesn’t have much rear-seat room, its airy design makes it feel as if it had more. 
HIM: A well-designed basic little car with good visibility, various versions of the 
Chevette are sold all over the world. At 
1959 pounds, it’s a little too small for me. 

CHEVROLET MONZA TOWN COUPE 

Price. $36oo 
MPG: 24 city, 33 highway 
HIM: The Monza is a slicker version of the Vega, with snappier styling, fancier trim and a higher price tag. Its standard four-cylinder engine boasts a 6o,ooo-mile guarantee. 
HER: Its interior trim looks cheap, and the lever to fold down the front seats is hard to find. The Monza feels like a toy. 
DODGE COLT 4-DOOR 

Price: $37oo 
MPG: 26 city, 35 highway 
HER: This car looks foreign on the out­ side, but domestic on the inside, with its plastic wood trim. It’s small but doesn’t seem tinny. 
HIM: The Colt’s a good idea if you like the Japanese approach—bo^y styling, thin doors, good economy—but worry about the availability of service. One good point about the Colt is that its engine doesn t re­ quire a catalytic converter. 
FIAT 131 4-DOOR 

PRICE $35oo 
MPG: 28 city, 35 highway 
HIM: On paper, Fiat offers one of the best little sedans going, with fine econ­ omy, good power and handling, and all the advantages of front-wheel-drive. But they also seem to require a lot of maintenance. 
HER: The upright style of the seats even leaves good room for two backseat passen­ gers—as long as the folks up front aren’t too tall. 
HONDA ACCORD 

Price: $43oo 
MPG: 21 city, 35 highway 
HIM: It’s funny how some Japanese auto stylists persist in scaling down Detroit ideas to fit little cars—with limited suc­ cess. This is a prime example with its small side-glass area and fast back roof­ line. 
HER: Its low visibility makes passen­ gers inside feel more cramped. You don’t nave the feeling of spaciousness that you get in the Fiat, for instance. 
COMPACTS 

AMC HORNET 4-DOOR 

INTERMEDIATES 

PONTIAC ASTRE SAFARI WAGON15 

Price: $33oo 
MPG: 28 city, 42 highway 
HER: It’s cute, and would be easy to drive and park, but doesn’t feel as solid as 

Price: $4,ooo 
MPG: 24 city, 37 highway 
HER: From the driver seat, this car feels really good. And the back seat doesn’t seem too bad. Lots of little touches make this a lot of car for the money—the wiper on the rear window, for instance. 
HIM: With its front wheel drive, peppy little engine and five-speed gearbox, the 
Accord performs about as well as the VW 
Scirocco, the sporty version of the Rabbit that goes for $5,ooo. 
MERCURY BOBCAT RUNABOUT 

HIM: The Bobcat differs from the Ford 

Price: $39oo 
MPG: 18 city, 25 highway 
HIM: This is the last year for this highly popular intermediate model. For ’78 it will be down-sized to around 31oo pounds from its present 38oo. But don’t expect a deal on one; dealers can be expected to capitalize on the fact that ’77 will see the last heavy Chevy mid-size cars. 
HER: The new Impala is about the same size outside, but the Malibu has less interi­ or room. The intermediate does have more sculptured styling. I don’t like the wind­ shield wipers that fold away under the cowl; imagine digging them out from ice and snow that could collect there. 
DODGE MONACO EIGHT 4 -DOOR 

Price: $86oo 
MPG: 14 city, 18 highway 
HER: It looks too aggressive and im­ practical. There’s so much wasted space. 
I notice there’s a vanity mirror on the pas­ senger side visor — the woman’s place in the Corvette. 
HIM: With its incredibly long nose, small two-seat passenger compartment and minimal trunk, the Vette is arrogance personified. Although its performance isn’t as supersonic as it was during the 6os, it still sells about 4o,ooo a year. And that’s pure gravy, since the Vette's basic design is unchanged for almost IO years. Too heavy for a real sports car, too thirsty for these fuel-short times, the Vette is sched­ uled for redesign in 198o. 

DATSUN 28oZ TWO-PLUS-TWO 

Price: $4249 
MPG: 13 city, 18 highway 
HIM: Last year’s Coronet has become this year’s Monaco, the nameplate that once went on the full-size Dodge. Loaded with options, this intermediate’s sticker price can reach $7,ooo easily. 
HEIR: I prefer the Aspen. For a mid­ sized car, the Monaco’s rear seat isn t roo­ my enough, and using the rear doors is a chore. 

HER: I like its styling, which reminds me of a Jaguar or Aston Martin, two very expensive British sports cars. This is the first high-performance car I’ve seen that 
I’d feel comfortable with. Maybe that’s be­ cause it doesn’t rely on super-macho paint jobs and Jaws-like styling. 
HIM: When the Datsun sports car first hit these shores, it was the bargain of the decade at around $4,ooo 
Inflation has changed that, somewhat, but the Z car still offers a lot. 

Price: $49oo 
MPG: 15 city, 19 highway 
HIM: This five-passenger intermediate is a proven design, basically unchanged for five years. In ’76, it was called the Torino. 
Ford is responding to GM’s down-sizing program by playing marketing games — naming its mid-size car after its standard 
LTD. 
HER: I like the velour seats, but I sus­ pect they’d dirty easily. The LTD II’s front-end styling is very imposing, with its square headlights and long nose. 
OLDS CUTLASS SUPREME 

Price: $47oo 
MPG: 15 city, 21 highway 
, 
HIM: The Matador is one of the indus- 

Price: $56oo 
MPG: 16 city, 26 highway 
HIM: This is the single most popular model in America today, outselling even its brothers in the Pontiac, Buick and 
Chevy lines. But if you get the standard V- 
6 engine, the Cutlass’ beauty is only skin deep. A car weighing 36oo pounds needs at 

CHEVROLET CHEVETTE 
HATCHBACK 

 trol on the road in this little car than in a big one. It feels solid too. The interior isn’t too honky-tonk, despite the fake wood trim. 
HIM: The Mustang is six inches longer and 3oo pounds heavier than its cousin the 
Pinto, making it a better-feeling and han­ dling road car. Economy ratings listed above are for the standard four-cylinder engine, which strains to push the 
27oo-pound Mustang to highway speeds. 
OLDS STARFIRE 

 try’s best-kept secrets, a proven design roughly the same size as GM’s new small­ er big cars. You can probably get a good deal on one too. Its biggest drawback is its gas economy rating, compared to the Im­ pala six’s 17-22 mpg. The difference is even greater between the Matador and Impala 
V-8s — 13-17 mpg versus 16-22 mpg. 
HER: This car reminds me of the full- sized sedans of the ’6os. It even has front vent windows, which I miss in the other cars. You could fit six people into it with­ out much strain. 

Price: $5ooo 
MPG: 18 city, 29 highway 
HIM: With the V-6 engine and four-speed transmission, the Starfire is a nifty little sporty machine. Its performance and price are equivalent to its competitors, the Mus­ tang ll and Capri. 
HER: I like its interior trim better than that on the Monza, which is Chevy’s ver­ sion of the Starfire. But it has the abrasive personality of a motorcycle — too macho. 

CHEVROLET CORVETTE 

Price: $37oo 
MPG: 24 city, 3o highway 
HER: This good-looking little car could fit four people, but they’d have to be good friends. Parking would be no hassle. 
HIM: One auarrel.I have with all these 
Japanese-made cars is that their pedals are too small and set too close for even my size eights. Main selling point for the Opel- 
Isuzu is economy—ratings listed above are for automatic transmission. 

Price: $38oo 
MPG: 18 city, 23 highway 
HIM: The Pacer can’t be compared to any other car. It’s seven inches wider than a Maverick, but less than an inch longer than a Pinto. Interior room for passengers is excellent. 
HER: What always bothered me about the Pacer is that it looks like a shoe — wide in the back and pinched in front. 
FORD PINTO CRUISING WAGON 

Price: $4ooo 
MPG: 
HIM: This tricked-up Pinto station wa­ gon is designed to cash in on the van craze, with its side panels filled in except for por­ tholes. It’s one of the little Ford’s biggest sellers this year, and may be hard to find in some areas. 
Price: $35oo 
MPG: 18 city, 23 highway 
HER: It seems a good basic economy car, with more rear seat room than the 
Maverick. Lack of visibility is a drawoacK. 
HIM: There is a startling resemblance between this year’s Hornet and next year’s 
Ford compacts—except that the Fords will have a higher roofline and more glass area. The Hornet’s gas economy is com­ petitive with other compacts, and AMC of­ fers an excellent warranty. 

BUICK SKYLARK 4-DOOR 

Price: $3825 
MPQ: 16 city, 26 highway 
HIM: Although the Skylark is a brother under the skin to the Chevy Nova, its fans claim that Buick takes more care in put­ ting its cars together. With its good visibili­ ty, comfortable upright seats and fine gas economy, it reminds me of the best fea­ tures of Detroit sedans 2o years ago. 
HER: The Skylark costs about $25o more than a comparable Nova. and if this partic­ ular car is any indication, it s worth it. I like the sound of the doors. They’re like an expensive handbag closing. 

Price: $45oo 
MPG: 16 city, 24 highway 
HIM: When introduced in ’75, the Grana da was a bright spot in an otherwise bad year. This particular model is supposed to suggest the performance and luxury of a 
Mercedes 45o SLC. Considering that the 
Mercedes costs almost four times as much, the Ford doesn’t do that badly. 
HER: I like the open-weave inserts in the upholstery. But I'm uncomfortable with the fake wood trim and plastic gee­ gaws. 
FORD MAVERICK 4-DOOR 

Price: $4,ooo 
MPG: 21 city, 28 highway 
HER: Getting in and out of the rear doors isn’t as easy as it should be, but it seems like a good basic economy car. 
There are no gee-gaws on the interior trim, and I like that. 
HIM: Some folks prefer the four-door se­ dan for handling as well as room, since it is about eight inches longer. This is the last year for this model, and sales of the 
Maverick have been lagging — so you should be able to get a good deal. 

HER: It looks like it belongs to a flower shop. It has no visibility on the sides. I’d prefer the regular wagon. 
MERCURY CAPRI ll 

• 
--— - .........■■ i...-— 
Price: $5ooo 
MPG: 25 city, 35 highway 
HIM:Similar to the Ford Mustang II, the 
Capri is an inch narrower, a couple hundred pounds lighter and has been around longer, since 1971. It’s assembled in 
Germanv, and .the mark-to-dollar ex­ change rate makes it rather expensive. 
HER: I would only like the Capri without the garish body-striping that you see on a lot of them. 
FORD MUSTANG ll GHIA 

Pinto only in its trim, grille styling and sound-deadening. Deciding between the two mostly revolves around whether you prefer the Mercury or Ford nameplate— you pay about $1oo extra for the Mere. 
HER: This particular Bobcat feels more solid than a Pinto, at least to me. Since this model isn’t a sales winner for Mercu­ ry, you might be able to get a good deal on one. 

Price: $45oo 
MPG: 26 city, 37 highway 
HIM: Identical in body shape to the 
Chevy Vega, the Astre features a different four-cylinder engine. So many drivers have complained about the Vega’s aluminum blocs motor that a safe course would be the Pontiac and its cast iron block engine. 
HER: This car has nice lines. It seems comfortable, maneuverable and economi­ cal. This would be a fine wagon for a wom­ an with a small family.

KMMJEZ v« 

Price: $43oo 
MPG: 17 city, 24 highway 
HER: This is an intelligent alternative to a full-sized wagon or van, if you don’t need quite that much room and aren’t willing to spend $6,ooo or up. I don’t know that much about engines, but the standard Slant Six is legendary for its reliability. 
HIM: The Volare and its Dodge brother, the Aspen, are redesigned versions of the 
Dart and Valiant—and have retained the old series’ reputation as durable, economi­ cal compacts. 
SAAB 99 EMS 

HER: It reminds me of the Volvo, only it’s sleeker looking. The Saab’s interior is even more comfortable, because there’s no drive-shaft hump. The rear seat will ac­ commodate two adults very easily. 
HIM: The Saab boasts superior traction and handling thanks to its front-wheel- drive, a feature that Ford, GM and Chrys-

TOYOTA CELICA

MPG: 19 city, 27 highway 
HER: An intelligent car without being stodgy, the Nova feels solid. Its styling isn’t threatening, and its interior is roomy. 
HIM: .The Nova is one of Chevy’s stars, at least in engineering. When introduced in 
’75, it pointed the way for subsequent GM down-sizing. 

DODGE ASPEN COUPE 

Price: $31oo 
MPG: 21 city, 28 highway 
HER: I like the simple, functional but good-looking interior. The Comet’s outside styling is clean enough, but the rear roof­ line would make visibility difficult. 
HIM: Brother to the Ford Maverick, the 
Comet is also only a body shell away from the Granada and Monarch. Since its sales have been slow, and ifs slated for redesign next year, you should be able to get a good deal. 
MERCURY MONARCH GHIA 4-DOOR 

 ler all have plans to use within the next couple years. One drawback to owning a 
Saab is its relatively small U.S. dealer net­ work—a situation that the Swedish firm is trying to correct. 
VOLVO 242 DL 

Price: $62oo 
MPG: 22 city, 2o highway 
HIM: Six grand is an awful lot of money for a car with a wheelbase one inch longer than the Maverick’s. Volvos are known for their durability and good handling. 
HER: You really sit up straight in these seats, and have a good view aff around. A family that needs a car in a big city could do well with a Volvo. 

Price: $3582 
MPG: 2o city, 29 highway 
HER: I could really go for this car. 
There’s little wasted space. It’s not a show-off, yet the Aspen is well-styled. 
HIM: You sit up high in the Aspen. It al­ most reminds me of a light truck. But it doesn’t ride like one, and is indeed fairly nimble even with the standard suspension. 
With its optional 36o cubic-inch V-8 , the As­ pen is, surprisingly, one of the fastest pro­ duction cars made in America. 

GRANADA SPORTS COUPE 

Price: $47oo 
MPG: 18 city, 23 highway 
HIM: Basically a plusher version of the 
Ford Granada, the Monarch Ghia features pockets on the back of the front seats, an old idea whose time has returned. Smooth luxury in a compact package is what the 
Monarch sells. You can order a Monarch loaded with options that approaches a Lin­ coln Versailles for creature comforts. 
HER: I like the simplicity of its styling, although it also seems luxurious. I don’t want to be embarrassed by my car. 

PLYMOUTH VOLARE WAGON 

 least the smallest optional VS, the 
28o-cubic-incher. And matched with the five-speed manual transmission, it’s rated at 17-25 mpg 
HER: It seems very driver-oriented. 
Front-seat passengers can’t see the spee- demeter, making it difficult to be a back­ seat thriver. Back seat comfort isn’t the twodoor Cutlass’ strong point. I think its racy styling and flight deck interiors sell the Cutlass.

Price: $56oo 
MPG: 17 city, 25 highway 
HIM: Although basically the same car as the Obis Cutlass or Chevy Malibu, the 
Le Mans is styled differently — and oddly. 
Its front end is rectangular, but its sculp­ tured ride panels flow into a boat-tail rear. 
Either you like it or you don’t. Most Pon­ tiacs are like that, with their two-fisted image. 
HER: 
Except for the small Astre, there’s an overwhelming quality about 
Pontiacs. The LeMans is the kind of car where the little women sit in the back and chat — leaving the important stuff to the men up front. 
INTERMEDIATE 
SPECIALTY 

CHEVROLET MONTE CARIO 

Price: $5ooo 
HIM: One of Chevy’s sales leaders since its introduction six years ago, the Monte 
Carlo is scheduled for down-sizing next year. A personal luxury car, its selling point is image, not practicality or perform­ ance. 
HER: Its sculptured lines are pleasing, and its seats seem comfortable, even rn the back. But getting back there is some­ thing else—a hassle climbing over the front seat belts. 
FORD THUNDERMRD 

Price: $5o63 
MPG: 15 city, 19 highway 
HER: I like the front-end styling, which is more rounded and less imposing than the LTD II or Country Squire. Seats feel comfortable, but there isn t much room in the back ami visibility would be a problem. 
HIM: Ford’s big winner thi£ year, basi­ cally a fancy version of the intermediate 
LTD II, the T-Bird features that airplane cockpit feeling for the driver. That makes the 8o mph speedometer pretty silly,

All the controls, even the heating, are de­ signed solely for the driver’s use. 
FULL-SIZE 

MUCK ELECTRA 225 4-DOOR 

Price: $9,ooo 
MPG: 15 city, 22 highway 
HIM: The contrast between die 77 and 
76 Electras is amazing. Once the essence of banana boat luxury, the big Buick now gives you just as much interior room in a much more manageable package. 
HER: Rear legroom is excellent, you aren’t overwhelmed with die instrumenta­ tion when you sit in the driver’s seat. I especially like the large courtesy lights set in the bottom of the doors. 

CHRYSLER NEWPORT 4-DOOR 

Price: $528o 
MPG: 12 city, 18 highway 
HIM: Considering that the name Chrys­ ler carries about as much prestige as Cad­ illac or Lincoln, this 46oo-pound sedan is quite a bargain. You can load it up with options for a sticker price of $7,5oo—less than a loaded Mercury. 
HER: They don’t overdo the plastic wood paneling inside and it has acres of trunk space—2o cubic feet. But I still wouldn’t want to drive one. 
CHEVROLET CAPRICE ESTATE WAGON 

Price: $65oo 
MPG: 15 city, 28 highway 
HER: This is the first full-sized wagon 
I’ve seen that I could drive comfortably. I don’t feel like I’m sitting on the bridge of a super-tanker. But it would be difficult keeping an eye on kids in the rear-faring third seat, and I wouldn’t want to rule backwards myself. 
HIM: The estate wagon would certainly be more at home in shopping center park ing lots than the Ford Country Squire. 
Mileage listed above is for the optional 
35o-cubic-inch V-8 engine; its pulling power is needed for the heavier loads hauled in a wagon. 

CHEVROLET IMPALA 2-DOOR 

FORD COUNTRY SOURS WAGON 

Price: $6,ooo 
MPG: 13 city, 18 highway 
HER: I could never imagine driving it 
The wagon just seems too rig. There’s plenty of interior room, mid the seats feel comfortable, but the down-sized Chevy wa­ gon offers the same package wrapped up rn a smaller outride. 
HIM: We big Ford remind terprise when you sit in the driver’s seat.

At highway speeds, you fed like you’re floating effortlessly over the road, which doesn’t please sports car buffs. Then again, most Americans prefer the soft ride. 
MERCURY GRAND MARGINS 4-DOOR 

Price: $8,ooo 
MPG: 13 city, 18 highway 
HIM: For folks who can’t see spending the extra $3,ooo for a Lincoln, the big Mere offers a couple more cubic feet of trunk f ace with enough room for six six-footers, eighing about 5oo pounds less than the four-door Lincoln, the Marquis is for big people who drive long distances. 
HER: Ifs like a Boeing 747 jet. I wouldn’t fed in control driving this car. 
But the glove compartment is nice and rig, wide and deep enough for a iarge-format road atlas. 

PLYMOUTH GRAN FURY 2-DOOR 

Price: $5ooo 
MPG: 13 city, 18 highway 
HIM: Gas economy ratings listed above are for the standard 318 cubic-inch V-8— which can barely move the rig two-ton 
Plymouth. A better bet would be the 36o V- 
8, costing about $5o extra. But then the 
Gran Fury’s mileage drops to 12 city, 18 highway. 
HER: I just can’t understand why any­ one would want such a big car, especially a two-door model. But the front seat can fit three across easily, and I like the center placement of the dashboard and its roomi­ ness. 

VA N S-T RU C KS 

CHEVY LUV PICKUP 

Price: $5418 
MPG: 13 city, 18 highway 
U M : The Cordoba’s basic chassis and body are shared with the Dodge Charger, whose base price is $4oo lower. But since prestige is the whole idea behind personal luxury cars, folks tend to go with the clas­ sier Chrysler nameplate. Both cars are known for having better handling than the average two-ton luxury coupe. 
HER: It seems to have an even longer 

Price: $5ooo 
MPG: 17 city, 22 highway 
HER: I like it. It doesn’t have that loom­ ing flight-deck feeling. It doesn’t fed too wide. The seats feel comfortable, but I’d avoid the light-colored velour upholstery— it would get a hard time from Kids. Even the glove compartment is deep and roomy. 
HIM: The Impala is the shape of auto­ motive things to come; genuine six-passen­ ger cars that weigh only as much as to­ day’s intermediates. The big Chevy comes standard, for tbs first time in several years, with a six-cylinder engine. Its gas economy ratings are listed above, rd pre­ fer the medium, 3o5-cubic-inch V-8, rated at 16-21 mpg. After ail, at 37oo pounds, the 
Impala isn’t exactly small. 

: $38oo 
MPG: 23 city, 33 highway 

HER: This nifty little thine is perfect for a gardener or a small-scale landscaper. 
Ifs definitely a woman’s truck—even the name is feminine. I can see a farm couple having a big pickup for him and this little erne for ter. 
HIM: Birt you can’t call it frilly—just the opposite, in fact. I think you’d be better off with the standard four-speed gearbox, especially if you’re planning to haul any­ thing. 

CHEVY SUBURBAN LUDGATE 

Price: $8,5oo 
MPG: 14 city, 2o highway 
HIM: This special version of the Dodge van features metal flake paint, deluxe swiv­ el seats, shag carpeting and a heavily tint­ ed glass porthole. It also has low-profile radial tires, chrome wheels and the small 
V-8 engine. 
HER: I wouldn’t feel comfortable driv­ ing this;getting in and out of tight spots would be a problem. If it came with a driv­ er, I wouldn’t mind it. 

FORD ECONOUME VAN 

Price: $5ooo 
MPG: 18 city, 25 highway 
HER: A van fuels my fantasies; I want to take off on the highways of the world. 
There's enough room in the back for a family to sleep. 
HIM: Since Ford vans have been rede­ signed with a stubby front nose, they han­ dle better. Customizing a van to your per­ sonal specifications can cost six grand and up. But using one for family trips can save money in the long run over motel rooms. 

JEEP RENEGADE 4-WHEEl-DRIVE 

 ice: $55oo 
MPG: 17 city, 21 highway 
HIM: Jeeps are legendary for their dura­ bility and ease of maintenance. Burt option­ al V-8 engines available on Jeeps are equipped with catalytic converters, and are harder to work on. Its fancy paint and seat covers make this model more practi­ cal as a beach buggy than as a deep woods machine. 
HER: It is funny to see a nuts-and-bolts car tricked up with trim gee-gaws. Jeeps are very romantic to me—the automotive equivalent of blue jeans and work boots. 
Birt I confess I’d get one with power steer­ ing. 

Price: $5,ooo 
MFG: 18 city, 24 highway 
HIM: An interesting combination of car and truck features, built on a pickup chas­ sis but with a large passenger-carrying ca­ pacity. Getting back into the rearmost seat can be a problem if you’re not feeling spry. 
HER: Especially with the Silverado trim option, which goes for about $5o6, this is a 
Marlboro Man’s truck—bus actually, since it’ll seat eight people. 

DODGE ADVENTURER SE PICKUP 

MPG: IS city, 24 highway 
HIM: Based on the lowest priced full- sized pickup in America, although (rf course you spend more if you want its op­ tional gear. Dodge’s reputation for building tough trucks dates back 5o years. 
HER: The doors aren’t as heavy as the 
Dodge pickup I had, but the seat seems wider. It could fit four .people.

 r How to avoid the aging tendencies of your zodiac s ig n -tw o fun pages with tips1 

YOU can stay young and healthy 
— with a little help from the stars. 

The things that age us are the thoughts we think, the air we breathe, emotional turmoil, food, chemical additives, lack of exer­ cise and short, shallow breathing. 
Inner conflicts that create stress are the greatest killers of youth. 
To combat these conflicts, you must realize that there is a solu­ tion to every problem. If this is done calmly, you will eliminate much of the stress and strain so harmful to youthful appearance. 
Chase the negative thoughts from your mind. Realize that your mind and body are inseparable and that every emotional upset is a physical one as well. 
Face the fact that you can’t eliminate problems, but you can change your approach to them. 
Running or jogging can help 
But each sign of the zodiac has a different approach. The following instructions can help you avoid the aging tendencies of your sign.

DYNAMIC 
ARIES 
March 21-April 19 

ARIES are dynamic and have ac­ tive imaginations. 
They enjoy life’s adventures and are rarely bothered by feelings of repression 
— an aging factor. 
Boredom and monotony are the worst things that can happen to an Aries. 
Aries can find their way out of misfortune and they take pleasure in solving problems. They are so physically active, they rarely need to exercise outside their dai­ ly routine. 
But Aries are vulnerable to se­ vere headaches. They are inclined to turn gray early and should not hesitate to tint or color their hair. 
Since Aries rules the head, Aries women should have youthful hair­ styles. 
Aries women were liberated long before women’s lib. They must remember not to dominate their mates because of this. They often alienate the very people who are most useful to them. lf an Aries can subdue her tem­ per and can become more reflec­ tive before taking action, she will be happier. This is her key to remaining youthful. 
Change is exhilarating to an Ar­ ies. Impulsiveness is one of the stumbling blocks of this sign. Ar­ ies are often called the infants of the zodiac because they can throw temper tantrums when people do not furnish them with what they want, when they want it. 
Because Aries is a masculine sign, Aries women should play up their femininity. They are ideal career woman who are often too busy for sex or marriage. 
Typical 
Aries: 
Debbie 
Rey­ nolds, who keeps herself busy with her career and raising her two children from Eddie Fisher and Harry Karl’s children from a former marriage; and Joan Craw­ ford, Bette Davis and Gloria 
Swanson, who spent a good part of their lives as single women while pursuing their careers.

 feminine, warm and sexy. Love is their basic nature, but when it fails, money becomes the domi­ nating force. 
Taurus is the gourmet of the zo­ diac and both a lack of money or love can turn them to sweets. 
Luck and expansion is in Tau­ rus’ sign. This usually means a new and happy romance, travel and career advancement with more money. Unfortunately, the expansion also includes the waist­ line. Many married Taureans will be having additions to their fami­ lies. 
All Taureans have to be careful not to jump from one situation to a new one that can explode in their faces. 

Taurus women have to learn to be more independent. They can become possessive when they fall in love. They usually want to

 create a suitable nest for their mate and ifs during this time they live full, rich lives. 
It is only when they’re doubtful of their loved ones that they lose their tempers. Although they are placid on the outside, Taureans will charge if provoked. 
Being stubborn and set in their, ways is aging. 
Fortunately, most Taureans are very healthy and this keeps them forceful and youthful. 

Taurus rules the neck and throat. You should accent this by wearing jewelry, scarves and unusual colors. 
Avoid gaining weight and do neck and jaw exercises to prevent sag and a double chin. 

Typical Taurus: Audrey Hep­ burn, who has a beautiful neck and is still radiant and thin at 47. 
Cher Bono is also typical of the sign with her off again — on again marriage. 

JOYOUS 
GEMINI 

May 21-June 2o 

GEMINIS are always on the go. 
Travel and ccmmunications keep them happy. They stay abreast of the times. The world is a happy place for Geminis as long as they stay active. Geminis have a mar­ velous sense of humor and can laugh at themselves as well as the world about them. When the Gem­ ini loses this sense of humor, it immediately shows in her face. 
As a Gemini, your mate must be as mentally active as you are. 
Otherwise you can become criti­ cal and start to nag him. As long as your partner stimulates you mentally, you can be faithful. But when he becomes dull and refuses to communicate, you can go else­ where for your stimulation. 
Boredom and staleness are something Geminis cannot toler­ ate. They don’t realize when they have hurt someone. Geminis tend to live in their heads and can talk themselves in and out of love af­ fairs on a logical basis. 
TTiey hate to become lonesome. 
The nervous energy of a Gemini keeps both the body and mind young and quick. Her dual person­ ality can sometimes be hard on her nervous system Heavy smok­ ing should be avoided as it further stimulates an already hyperactive nervous system as well as lending to weaken the lungs, which are 
Geminis most sensitive parts of the body. 
Geminis can help retain their natural youthfulness by setting aside short periods for total relax­ ation. Gemini rules the hands and you should use special care, hand lotions, manicures, attractive jewelry to show them off. 
Typical Geminis: 
Those who have little girl qualities like Mari­ lyn Monroe, Carroll Baker and 
Karen Valentine. Even Judy Gar­ land, after a life of excesses, con­ tinued to have some of the wide­ eyed Dorothy of The Wizard Of Oz in her personality. 

SENSITIVE 
CANCER 

June 21-July 22 

THE MOON gives those bom un­ der this sign a sensitive, dreamy nature. It takes it’s women longer to grow up than the average wom­ an. 
Cancer women are usually de­ prived of their fathers either through death or divorce. For that reason, they may marry older men in their youth but look for 

 younger ones when they mature. 
Cancers naturally identify with young people. They are either children looking for parents or parents looking for children. 
When a Cancer’s security is threatened, she becomes worried, moody and slightly paranoid. This 

Ginger Rogers: A typical Moon- child with sense of humor. can make her fountain of youth turn stagnant. 
Cancer women should keep opti­ mistic friends around them. Tney are so sensitive that they pick up the mental attitudes of those they are near. Cancers can overeat for emotional reasons. 
Cancer rules the stomach and they have to be careful not to gain excess weight in that area. Can­ cers tend to resist exercise so it is difficult for them to lose weight. 
Cancer women are the most maternal and they often live their lives for their children. When the children leave home, often rebel­ ling against such smothering over-protection, the parent is of­ ten left alone and desolate. 
Try not to act like a doting, overly protective mother if you are a Cancer. Most people regard mothers as being of an older gen­ eration. In order to retain your youthfulness, do not allow your negative moods to gain too much control over your actions and reactions. 
Moonchildren have a tremen­ dous sense of humor. There are more comedians bom under this sign than any other. 
Typical 
Cancer: 
Humorous stars like Phyllis Diller, Milton 
Berle, Bill Cosby, Don Knotts, 
Red Skelton, Orson Bean, Mimi 
Hines, Mel Brooks and Art Link- letter. 
Cancers who have taken older men in their youth then gone on to younger ones are Leslie Caron, 
Gina Lollobrigida, Ginger Rogers and Della Reese. 

SPIRITED 
LEO 

July 23- August 22 

LEOS are ruled by the Sun, which gives them tremendous egos. 
Leos feel that everything should revolve around them. The Leo ego will not accept the fact that she could age. Leos have dramatic personalities and this is a great weapon against time. 
Everything Leo does is with a flair and the vivacity of Leos at­ tracts others as they are natural leaders. When Leos get overly emotional and overdramatize their problems, their health can be undermined. 
During the next two years, Sat­ urn. the taskmaster of the zodiac, will transit the Sun sign of the 
Leos During this time you should not drive yourself and overwork. 
Leos can be lazy. They want things to happen without exertion on their part. Only good things will happen this year to Leos, but 
Saturn will be testing many rela­ tionships. 
A really sound constructive re­ lationship will become even more stable but those built on shaky foundations can crumble. 
Your spirit will age only if you let it become skeptical and idle in unhappiness. Try to keep your sense of humor and a gay ap­ proach to life. Avoid self-pity, brooding or allowing your active imagination lo get out of bcunds. l^eos should not overdo or over­ compensate as they grow older. 
They can be daring in the ways they dress. Make sure you don’t dress like a clown just because you are entering middle age. 
The most beautiful women take tremendous pride in themselves. 
Leos have tremendous pride. 
They never give up and go to pot. Leos are usually physically active and this helps an illusion ot youth. 
Typical Leos: Actresses Lucille 
Ball and Mae West who have a talent for staying young. 
WITTY 
VIRGO 

August 23- September 23 
VIRGO is ruled by Mercury and has the gift of perpetual youth. 
Mercury rules the mind and Vir­ gos delight in using their sharp wits to solve problems. They take pleasure in planning and working. 
A Virgo’s intellect is her true 

 j source of youth and it must never become sluggish through inactivi­ ty and disillusionment. 
Virgos want everyone to be me­ ticulous at all times. Almost ev­ ery expert is a Virgo or has many planets in that sign. Virgo women do not age when they are busy us­ ing their heads. 
Virgos should never be upset with a mass of trivia and worri­ some concern for the inconse­ quential. Virgo rules the lower digestive tract and has to be care­ ful of what is eaten. 
One advantage of being a Virgo is that you will watch your diet and have wonderful taste in clothes. Any type of disorderliness effects the nerves of a Virgo. 
Because they are such good technicians, Virgos have to be careful they don’t turn into love­ less automatons. Virgos should re­ frain from being critical. 
They should show the warmth of their true affections and smile more. They often appear too stiff 
Continued on Pcge 14 

 and should remember that frown­ ing causes wrinkles. 
No others in the sign of the zo­ diac are so fussy about the way they look. Virgos are neat and look as if they have just dressed up to go out. You should guard against selecting too many dark or dull colors. Don’t wear your work or business clothes when you go out to have fun. Try buy­ ing some casual clothes for fun. 
Typical Virgos: Perfectionists like Ingrid Bergman, one of the theater’s finest technicians, and such time-defying beauties as 
Greta Garbo, Lauren Bacall and 
Sophia Loren. 
BEAUTIFUL 
LIBRA 

September 24-October 23 
VENUS, the planet of love and beauty, rules Libra. Librans have innate good taste, charm and a smile that lights up a room. The 

Hidden secrets of the zodiac can help you stay younger longer 

Brigitte Bardot: A Libra who sacrifices for applause. 

 good taste helps in their choice of hair styles and clothes. 
Librans can not function in chaos. They are always trying to balance the scales, which are their symbols. Because of their balancing nature, too much of anything soon palls for Librans. 
It is then that they become quite lazy. They are the same with food, drink and even love. 
They will overindulge and fol­ low this by dieting and absti­ nence. After they have recouped their energy, they will be back at work twice as hard or back out on the town again. 
The biggest threat to Librans’ 

 looks of youth is overindulgence. 
They have a love of pleasure and excessive sweets. 
This can make them susceptible to diabetes. Overindulgence in alcohol can bring on severe kid­ ney and bladder disturbances as this and the lower back are Li­ brans’ weakest parts of the body. 
Librans love applause. They of­ ten have to sacrifice too much to get it. 
Librans are the love goddesses and they are happiest when they are in love. Be careful not to be too demanding about love as it has a way of eluding those who are all take and no give. 
You will keep your youthfulness intact by making certain that you always maintain proper balance in all the areas of your life. 
Typical Librans. who have sac­ rificed much for applause, are 
Brigitte Bardot. Rita Hayworth. 
Melina Mercouri, Rona Barrett and Maureen Dean, second wife of another Libran, John Dean. 
STRONG 
SCORPIO 

October 24-November 22 
THE RULER of Scorpio is Pluto, which gives unusual magnetic personality and dynamic strength. 
Scorpios are clever ladies of the zodiac. They have tremendous de­ termination and a deep and al­ most overpowering emotional drive. 
Scorpios can indulge in ex­ tremes of negative emotions such as jealousy. possessiveness, brooding, hatefulness, revenge and resentfulness. This can be a hazard to their happiness. 
Scorpios are secretive, too. 
Holding things in causes them to worry' and brood and this can be extremely aging to a woman. 
Scorpios must learn to relax their possessive qualities Love is not bending others to their will.

Because of overindulgence, many Scorpios have to battle weight much of their lives. They often have a problem with alco­ hol. 
Scorpio is symbolized by the scorpion that stings itself with its own venom. The sting of Scorpio’s sarcastic tongue can make her very unpopular and lonesome.

JOVIAL 
SAGITTARIUS 

November 23-December 21 
SAGITTARIUS is ruled by Jupi­ ter, the planet of luck and jovial youth. Sagittarians are so active and involved in life that they do not have time to sit down and brood over the unpleasant. Jupi­ ter is also the planet of expansion and it can expand the waistline as well as the personality. 
Sagittarians can develop double chins so they must also watch their posture.' They usually have large frames and terrific, long legs. They are athletic types who love to horseback ride, hunt, swim and fish with the men in their lives. 
They love the outdoors and they must remember to protect their skins with moisturizing creams. 
They hate artificiality and usually wear less makeup than other women. 
They must remember to change their styles with the times. Cu­ riosity and an interest in life is in itself a fountain of youth. Sagit­ tarians love to travel and come and go as they please. 
Sagittarians should develop more femininity. They can carry casualness too far. Sagittarians can make themselves physical wrecks from their high living. 
They tend to be accident prone and this can undermine their health. But they seem never to 

 run out of steam. They live in the present and that is one of the greatest protections from old age. 
Typical 
Sagittarians usually have good teetn and a million dol­ lar smile, like Jane Fonda, Dina 
Merrill, Betty Grable and Deanna 
Durbin. 
POWERFUL 
CAPRICORN 

December’22-January 19 
SATURN, the planet of age and wisdom, rules Capricorn. Capri­ corns often appear to be old in their youth and young in their old age. 
They tend to be very’ solemn in their views of life and are the worriers of the zodiac. This can bring premature aging. 
Capricorn women usually mar­ ry older men in their youth and younger men in their old age. 
They have a great fear of de­ pendency. Since Capricorn wom­ en live to be quite old, they fre­ quently outlive their husbands. 
Capricorns are among the sacri­ ficing people and often remind their children how many sacri­ fices they made for them. 
Capricorn women should work on their sense of humor and learn to relax. Some people equate a lack of humor with old age. Capri­ corns need to be kept busy. Ambi­ tions are a necessity with them. 
They are the climbers of the zo­ diac and must be careful not to form attachments to people just so they can help them up the lad­ der of success. 
When Capricorn women do not have a career of their own, they often become a power behind the throne. Capricorns like fame and recognition and if they can’t get it themselves, they want husbands who can. 
Capricorns should take special care of their teeth, skin and bones. They often develop arthri­ tis or rheumatism in the knee areas. 
If you are a Capricorn, you will find your fountain of youth if you learn to enjoy life more with good companionship and a few laughs. 
Typical Capricorns: The power behind the power,- Lady' Bird 
Johnson. 
Others who appear youthful in old age are Marlene 
Dietrich, 
Ava 
Gardner, 
Ethel 
Merman, Helena Rubenstein, Lor­ etta Young and Jane Wyman. 
Watch for Faye Dunaway, Maria 
Schell, Barbara Rush and Mary 
Tyler Moore to retain their youth into old age. 

ORIGINAL 
AQUARIUS 
January 2o-February 19 

BEING ruled by Uranus makes 
Aquarians unconventional and they don’t give much thought to age. They tend to live in the fu­ ture and are the most individual­ istic ladies of the zodiac. 
Originality is the key to their lasting youthfulness. They are unique in their wardrobe, hair styles, and don’t care what others may think of them, 
Aquarian women often harbor secret dreams of marriage as a utopian existence. They have tal­ 

 ent for picking men with glaring faults, which they see perfectly clear before they marry. 
But they have so much faith in their power to reform that they march to the altar without a qualm. 
Aquarians should not let prob­ lems diminish their sunny, good natures. Their friendliness ex­ pressed openly will aid in keeping young, vital and alive. 
Aquarians like to shock people. 
They must train themselves to be different without being obnoxious. 
If they can avoid these character­ istics, their idealism will keep the fountain of youth bubbling. 
Typical Aquarius: Carol Chan­ ning. who was chastized by the 
Press for wearing an unusual cos­ tume to a White House wedding, and Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, who refuse to grow old. 
Zsa Zsa was recently divorced 
I‘rom her sixth husband. 

DREAMY 
PISCES 
February 2o- March 2o 
PISCES, ruled by Neptune, the planet of dreams and illusions, give these women the magical ability to look just about any way they might wish — young or old 
Pisces women usually have beautiful eyes — large, round, dark and deep. The lashes tend to be thick, long and rather nicely shaped. 
Pieces also have soft skin and they need to take care of it by us­ ing moisturizing creams regular­ ly. The worst foes of this marvel­ ous skin are alcohol, drugs and worry. 
Pisces have so much empathy that they think they can take on all the troubles of the world. They 

Dinah Shore: A Pisces who developed toughness. 

 are bom worriers with the unfor­ tunate tendency to anticipate the worst. Many Pisces can be found in the medical or social service fields. 

For this reason they are taken advantage of more than any other sign in the zodiac. They are ex­ ploited by people who claim to be their friends. They must learn to be more discriminating. 

Pisces are dreamers and dreaming of love and romance helps keep them young 
Though disappointments can cause their fountains of youth to fall to a trickle, they should take the harsher moments with humor and tolerance and this will keep the fountains of youth bubbling. 
Typical Pisces: Elizabeth Tay­ lor, Liza Minnelli, Merle Oberon, 
Cyd Charisse, Dinah Shore and 
Barbara McNair. 
Liz has indicated her trait for appearing old or young in her re­ cent role in the movie Bluebird. 
She played four roles of disparate ages — one as a beautiful prin­ cess and another as an ugly, old witch. 

CURVY Margolyn Curtis is the shape of the future, according to her husband photographer, Pat Curtis. And he should know—he was the man who discovered Raquel Welch. Curtis, who was once married to

IRS spokesman Tony Bom bard­ ie r said there were a number of government programs to help people file. “They can come in to nave their forms done,” he said this week. 
People who are unable to leave their homes can benefit from IRS- sponsored Volunteer Income Tax

HOW TO CURE THAT WORN-OUT 

ACCOUNTANT 
John 
Quenton complained that he was tired, couldn’t sleep properly and had lost weight because of lack of appetite. 
“There’s nothing really wrong with me physically,” he told me. 
“It’s simply that I've been so overworked.” He was complain­ ing to the wrong man. Doesn’t he realize that he is working a lot less than my grandfather did? 
And I never heard him suffering unduly from overwork. 
I know it s very real for John to believe he has more of his share of the work load to carry than is proper. Maybe he does. 
But he should remember that every job has its good points and its bad ones. You’ve got to learn to roll with the punches, not to be­ come tense. Learn how to take the disappointments and irrita­ tions of life in a relaxed state of mind. 
“If you can do that,” I told 

FEELING 
DOCTOR’S 
CASEBOOK 

John, “I can almost guarantee you that you will not suffer the symptoms of ‘overwork.’ ” 
Of course, there are many phys­ ical diseases that can cause this feeling of fatigue and lack of ener- 
, and it is always wise to have a eck up by a doctor. 
Further, whether we feel over­ worked or not, we must realize that after a hard day’s work it’s natural to get just plain tired. 
Understand, though, the anti­ dote for ordinary fatigue is simple recreation. And I believe that the old rule of eight hours’ work, eight hours’ sleep, and eight hours’ play is still a good one. 
Recreation can take any form— 

Priest serves m eals-an d m artinis 
REV. Fred MacKillan offers churchgoers more than wine and wafers. 
He gives them martinis and prime ribs. For every lunch and dinner hour, the Catholic priest serves patrons at Padre’s Restaurant, which is attached to St. Thomas More Church in Denver, Colo. Father Mac­ 
Killan reports that business is good: “ Many people have come back be­ cause this was the first chance they’ve had to sit down and talk to a priest over a meal.” 

 work around the house, a hobby, a game, walk, music or anything else that gives a feeling of satis­ faction. People who have let their outside activities slip, who have no plans when the working day is over, who have too little to look forward to—are the ones who suf­ fer from “overwork.” 
John knew I was touching on his problem because, in fact, he does not have any outside interests ex­ cept his job and his family. This 
“overworked’’ feeling came about after his two children married and moved away from home. 
“ My advice is for you to look around and expand the scope of your life rather than withdraw,” 
I told him. “Do that and you’ll suddenly feel a great deal less overworked.” 
So I advised John to look for a cure in his community, which of­ fers many opportunities for recre­ ation in small or large groups. 
For example, churches, phi lam thropic organizations, and hospi­ tals are always anxious for help. 
Golf, bowling and bridge, too, are almost universally available. 
So I left John this thought: The feeling of being overworked is more mental than physical in ori­ gin. The best preventive for it is a well planned life filled with a variety of interesting activities.

“This is for people who have suffered some tragedy that makes it impossible for them to file, for instance a fire that destroyed rec­ ords,” Bombardier said. 
But he cautioned “you still owe any interest and penalties from 
April 15. Form 4868 doesn’t ex­ empt you from paying taxes.” 
Bombardier also said that the 
IRS suggests that taxpayers using 
Form 4868 also send the govern­ ment 9o percent of the estimated taxes they owe. 
“Also, keep a copy of the form to send when you do file your tax form, so the IRS will know you were granted an extension. 
“And if taxpayers don't have any additional schedules to fill out, they can send in their forms and W-2s, and the IRS will do their taxes for them,” 
The latest official figures show that Americans are in desperate 

 need of help with their taxes. 
They show that there is a 9.5 per­ cent error rate in filling out the long form, and a 13.1 percent er­ ror rate in the short form. Two years ago the error rate for both forms was only 5.1 percent. 

Recently, 
President 
Carter promised that things will be sim­ pler in future. 

COOKIE THIEF 5AYS: 
PLEASE FORGIVE ME’ 

GIRL SCOUT Stacey Hamsen was broken-hearted when three men in a car pulled up alongside her, grabbed the cookies she was sell­ ing and sped off. 

Stacey, of Fort Myers, Fla., complained to police, who bought 
55 boxes of cookies. And then two days later she received a letter containing $5. The letter said: 
“Please forgive my uncommon and unjust crime.” 
Why some daughters are afraid to leave home 
THE BIGGEST favor any mother can do a daughter is to prepare her for a life of her own. says a psychologist. 
But, Dr. Dorothy Flapan told 
THE STAR, too many mothers make daughters afraid of the world — and sentence them to a lifetime of cowering at home. 
These mothers fall into two types, said Dr. Flapan, director of group and family therapy at the 
Washington Square Institute of 
Psychotherapy and Mental Health in New York City. 
• First, there is the mother who does everything for a daughter, anticipating and supplying her ev­ ery need so the child becomes an overgrown baby lacking practical skills and faith in herself. 
• Second, there is the “self sac­ rificing” mother who gives her daughter the idea women are the life's victims — threatened by a world full of untrustworthy people including boys who “only want sex.” 
The daughter of this mother de­ cides her only option is to stay home — and take care of mother. 
Dr. Flapan suggested the fol­ lowing do’s and dont’s for moth­ ers who want their daughters to be independent instead of 
“mama’s girls” : 
TX) let your daughter dress her­ self, pick up after herself, and set­ tle her own quarrels with play- 
* mates. 
DO let your daughter decide what to eat and wear and what and whom to play with. Avoid an­ ticipating her wishes and giving her things before she asks for them. 

DO teach your daughter without criticizing her. Say “ Here is how to hold your fork"; not, “You are holding your fork all wrong ” 

IX) praise your daughters achievements, starting early. 

DO encourage your daughter to be spontaneous, even when she isn t a “perfect little lady” and her manners aren't the best. Too much strictness, too early, will 
.stifle her creativity and her abili­ ty to express her real feelings. 
DON'T tell your daughter boys are only after sex. This will terri­ fy her and make it difficult for her to relate to males healthily. 
IX)N'T teach your daughter to play a role when dating, lf she is overly worried about how she looks, sits and walks, she will be too self-conscious to enjoy herself. 
DO try and be a model of the woman you'd like your daughter to become. She’ll imitate the qual­ ities she sees in you — either con­ fidence and capability or fear and anxiety. 
DON T make a companion of your daughter. Develop your own interests and encourage your daughter to develop hers. 
DO explain the hazards, realist­ ically when you must keep your daughter from genuine dangers such as. big city streets at night. 
Let her know you aren't merely repressing her, 
DON’T choose your daughter’s dates for her. 
DO send your daughter away to school, or suggest she share an apartment with friends, if she seems afraid to leave home. 

COP NABS THIEF WITH NO HORSE SENSE 
A POLICE officer in Seattle, Wash., caught a horse thief red-handed 
— making off with Toni, a 13-year-old police department gelding. Offi­ cer Howard Haines left Toni tethered to a lamp post while ne ate lunch. 
Moments later he saw the horse being led across Occidential Park by a man, 27. The officer arrested the man who was held on suspicion of larceny.

Experts’ last-minute tips to help you file your tax return 

THE April 15 tax deadline is drawing near, but experts say there is no need to panic if you haven't filed your return yet. 
And they warned against doing a last-minute rush job—you’re only likely to make more errors with this year’s more complicated forms. 
Jerry Grossman, executive vice president of tax consultant H&R 
Block, gave these taxpaying tips to late filers: 
• The instructions are different this year, so read them carefully. 
• Be careful with the tax charts. 
Today you have to have your tax­ able income rather than adjusted gross income when you go to the tables, and that’s a major change. 
Adjusted gross income is your total income minus some specific exemptions, the most common of which are business expenses. Tax­ able income is what’s left after all deductions.

THIS I BELIEVE 

By Steve D u n le av y 
FDA should wait for all the facts about saccharin 

THE TIM E is not far off, I suspect,v*when l will pick up a newspaper to find the Food and Drug Administration has banned water. 
_ 

The reason, of course, will be that government scientists fed a rat five billion gallons of w ater and found it caused traces of cancer. 
I give this ludicrous exam ple to put into sensible focus the heated controversy over saccharin. 
Some Canadian government scientists fed a rat 2oo bottles of diet soft drink containing saccharin and the rats got cancer. To get an equivalent amount of saccharin, the FDA admits, a human would have to drink 8oo soft drinks a day for life. 
I’m willing to bet if you fet a rat 2oo anythings he will have some problem 
— from gas to cross eyes and. yes, cancer. 
Nobody has explained to my satisfaction what this has to do with a human being who uses a pinch of saccharin three times a day in coffee. 
If I knew that, I and millions of others would know where we are going. lf the situation stays as it is now, saccharin will be banned starting in 
July. This prospect horrifies doctors who have spent their lives researching diet and food substances. They are now saying that the nation will go back on the white sugar kick. 

A suspicious person might be tempted to think darkly that this is the sugar lobby’s finest hour, but enough of that. Back to the principle. Why has the FOA come down so hard on saccharin? 
Predictably it is the scare word “ can cer" which evokes the sam e reaction as words like “ sh ark " or “ sn ake." 
But it should be rem em bered — and this surprises many people — that cancer in the United States before 19oo was relatively unknown. 
My source is Dr. David Reuben, eminent researcher who wrote The Save 
Your Life Diet. 
His worldw ide research showed cancer — particularly stomach and colon cancer — rose dram atically in proportion to consumption of refined food, mainly white bread and refined white sugar. 
"It was a fad that started in Europe that the whiter the bread, the whiter the sugar, the more acceptable it w as," he said. 
“ It cost m ore because it could no longer be stone ground. That stuff was- left to the peasants. The aristocrats died off like flies while the peasants lived to a ripe old a g e ." 

 th e people who owned the flour and sugar nulls discovered that with refined flour and sugar in their silos, they got rid of their worst threat to business — rats! 

Rats thrived on healthy brown bread and broad brown sugar, but when they encountered white bread and white sugar, they died on the spot. 

“ How many times did your mother warn you against feeding cake to your dog because it would kill h im ?” Dr. Rueben said. 

“ She was right, cake will kill a dog. Yet we feed it to children with all that sugar in it." Dr. Rueben would never recommend taking saccharin, but neither does he want the country turned on to sugar. Use honey, he says. 

Well. I’m not that crazy about honey, even if I should be. And I don’t want to ban sugar or white bread — or saccharin. 

Rather, let’s take another look at saccharin and find out exactly what effect it would have on a coffee drinker. Millions of overweight people want to known, and we owe them that much. 

C igarettes carry a w arning that they can be dangerous to health. So perhaps should sugar, white bread, steak, pork, buttermilk — and sac­ charin. 
L et’s get all the facts before we single out one particular product. 

Rice is stiil top crop for Chinese farmers 

SEE SOLUTION PAGE 19 

RICE, pigs and fish are the main crop of mainland China’s population of farmers, says a 
U.S. government food expert. 

Dr. Y . Pom eranz, director of the 
USDA’s Grain M arketing Research 
Center, said the Chinese grow rice on 
25 percent of their sown land, and wheat — increasingly im portant in the Chinese diet — on 2o percent. 
Pork is the main source of animal protein, and the government hopes to 

 provide every Chinese with one pig and a sixth of an acre of land by the early 198os, Dr. Pomeranz said. 

He said the Chinese breed fish in many of their rice paddies and also take fish from the ocean, fresh water lakes and farm ponds. 

Dr. Pom eranz, writing about his tou r of the P e o p le ’s R ep u b lic of 
China in Food Technology magazine, said 8o to 85 percent of China’s people are engaged in agriculture.

Secret sex desires can turn a housewife into 
‘Mrs. Super clean’ 

LINDSAY WAGNER, TV’s Bionic Woman, was prepared to sacrifice her first big chance in movies — for the sake of her husband’s acting career. 

Offered a $5oo,ooo contract to play the lead in Para­ mount^ A Love Story In The Afternoon, Lindsay said: No - unless MICHAEL BRANDON was offered the part opposite her. 
The studio originally blanched at her demand. But later they took stock of her husband’s career and tal­ ents. 
Executives decided that perhaps Brandon, who has always been reticent about pushing him­ self in his career, was the man for the testing role 

By ANN HOLT 
DEEP sexual desires are making many housewives ob­ sessed with scrubbing and cleaning their homes, accord­ ing to a prominent psychia­ trist. 
Dr. Jack Chernus, acting chief of psychiatry at Gouverneur Hos­ pital in New York City, said: 
“ The Mrs. Supercleans are wom­ en for whom the clean house sym­ bolizes sexual cleanliness and sex­ ual purity.” 
But they can learn to overcome their compulsive desires to mop, dust, wash and wax. 
“ There are many Mrs. Super­ cleans in our society and they drive their husbands and children to distraction with their demands for cleanliness and more cleanli­ ness.” said Dr. Chernus. 
“ Mrs. Superclean is a woman who has deep sexual conflicts which she cannot resolve. It is as though she were scrubbing her own soul. She does not know how to deal with her sexual thoughts and desires. That s why she turns to scrubbing, cleaning, washing, redoing her closets, polishing the tiles and waxing the floors. 
When Mrs. Superclean’s house is spotless, Dr. Chernus said she takes pride in saying “ Look how clean I am .” 
A woman hostile toward her husband or in competition with a daughter may also be driven to compulsive cleanliness. 
“ The chances are that a woman who is Mrs. Superclean knows she is this type of woman already,” 
Dr. Chernus said. 
Here are 12 ways he suggests 
Mrs. Superclean can overcome her obsessions: 
O 
Relax! If you find yourself in this endless bind of spending every minute making the house shine and the laundry clean, sit down and start thinking if all this work is really neces­ sary. 
© 
Search for your area of con­ flict. 
Think over exactly what you are troubled about. Is it something with your husband? Or your children? Or. your older par­ ents? Or a sister? 
O 
Be specific about what it is. 
Spell it out to yourself. If necessary, keep a diary and write 
’/our feelings down. 
O lf you are having a sexual problem with your husband. try to talk it over with him and resolve the conflict. Ask him to be honest, and you be honest too Do 

PSYCHIATRIST 
TH IS WHAT TO 
DO ABOUT IT 

 not be ashamed of any sexual thoughts or acts. 
If you are a married worn- an. and you have been re­ pressing sex drives with your hus­ band because you felt you were l>eing naughty or aggressive, con­ quer these feelings. Make love in the way that you want to and in the way that satisfies you. 
O lf you have had the desire to flirt with another man do not be ashamed. These romantic urges happen even to married women. Do not give in to this urge if it is going to destroy your marriage. 
O 
Be proud of your own sex­ uality. 
Some women are deeply ashamed of themselves as sexual creatures. They feel it is wrong and immoral to be sexually desirous, even if they are mar­ ried. 
If you have longed to dress in a more sexual manner, to get away from being house­ wifely’ in appearance, then do it. 
Be prepared for jealous glances from your women friends. They may riot like the new styles that reveal you are sexual and not ashamed. 
O lf you've been putting off dieiing. or going to an exer­ cise class, don't put it off any longer. Some women stay fat be­ cause they don't want to appear thin and sexy. 
They become alarmed w'hen they think that sex will involve them. By staying fat. they put sex off. as fewer men will be attracted to them. 
Temper your urge to make your husband and children 

 be compulsively neat, too. Think it over. Children have to learn to clean up their rooms. But don’t goad them incessantly. 
© 
Stifle your urge to clean, and then clean again. If the house is sufficiently clean, then do something else. 
Don't repeat cleaning tasks. 
® lf your problem is that you w-ant to do something be­ sides being a housewife but have not admitted it to yourself or to your husband, then you should come to terms with this need, then talk it over with him You may find satisfaction in volunteer work, or in a part-time job. Or, you may wish to take courses in something, or go back to school if the children are sufficiently able to take care of themselves. 

The happy pair will now screen test together ill and word is that they will almost certainly be of­ fered both roles. 
“ But if he doesn’t get it she will be happy with TV until another of­ fer comes along,” said a col­ league on the set of Bionic Wom­ an. 
A new secret weapon has been devised by ABC to counter criti­ cism of 
TV violence—comedy shows will be increased from 3o minutes to 6o minutes next sea­ son. 
This means you’ll have twice as much of the FONZ on Happy 
Days, twice as much NANCY 
WALKER on Blansky’s Beauties which remarkably is almost cer­ tain to be renewed — and twice as much 
LAVERNE 
AND 
SHIR­ 
LEY. 
No doubt CBS and NBC will fol­ low suit, so America will be laughing its way through next season. 
This, incidentally, is the first year ROZ KELLY, who co-stars with Nancy on Beauties, will earn her living full-time as an actress. 
Previously she has had to bolster her earnings with stints as a pho­ tographer, dance hall hostess, bartender and cafe waitress.

New technique helps couples choose their baby’s sex 

A NEW way to pre-determine the sex of your baby has been discov­ ered by researchers. 
Parenthood counselor Dr. Eliza­ beth Whelan said that the time of the month a couple makes lo vc is a major factor in whether their baby is a boy or a girl. 
Key to the technique is the day of ovulation, when the egg is re­ leased into the ovary. It normally occurs midway in the menstrual cycle. 
Boys tend to be conceived when intercourse occurs four to six days before ovulation, according to Dr. Whelan, who is affiliated with Harvard University. 
Girls are more likely to be bom when intercourse occurs two to three days before ovulation. 
In her book, Boy Or Girl? The 
Sex Selection 
Technique 
That 
Makes All Others Obsolete (Bobbs 
Merrill, $6.95) — Dr. Whelan de­ scribes these two ways to deter­ mine “boy” and “ girl” days: 
• Take your temperature each morning immediately after you wake up. Temperature rises on the day of ovulation. When you know your cycle, you can predict your day of ovulation and count back four to six days for a boy, two to three days for a girl. 
• If you have a very regular cycle, use a calendar. In a normal cycle, ovulation usually occurs 14 days before menstruation begins. 
Dr. Whelan cautioned that the method, though usually relia­ ble, is not a sure thing. 
Thirty percent of couples using the technique correctly have had girls when they were trying for boys, and 4o percent have had boys when they wanted girls.

NETWORK bosses have been caught at one of TV’s shabbiest tricks — in­ terchanging plot scripts between se­ ries. 
For example the Six Million Dollar 
Man and The Bionic Woman regularly swap stories, but never have the prod­ ucers been as blatant as those who made a recent Police Woman story with ANGIE DICKINSON on NBC. 

It was almost word-for-word identi­ cal to an Ironside episode seven years ago that coincidentally was re run earlier this year. Only two names were changed.
