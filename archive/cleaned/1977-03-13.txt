Lo-Vaca’s phantom office building 

By JIM WOOD 
T h ere’s a phantom office building lurking somewhere in plans for settling Lo-Vaca Gath­ ering Co.'s natural gas battles. 
Corpus Christi officials arc saying the restructured Lo-Vaca ought to be there instead of in San Antonio because a 1o-story building the new company will get from Coastal States (las Corp is located in Corpus Christi. 
Dam puts 
S.A. in danger 
O 

, Olmos Dam is a dagger point­ ed at San Antonio’s heart, but the city can do something about it. U.S. Hep. Henry B. Gonzalez said Saturday. 

' ‘Twelve years ago, I suggested Ol­ mos Dam needed to be examined for strength and safety,” Gonzalez said. 
“ After being pushed, the city author­ ized a prelim inary study, at federal expense. 
“ Lo and behold, the U.S. Corps of 
E n g in e e rs found th at O lm os Dam realty did need some improvements." 
Gonzalez pointed out extensive rain­ fall north of the dam could put enough pressure on it that it wouldn’t stand up. 
“ The resulting Hood would devastate the area all the way to downtown,” he said, lie noted engineers say the way to solve the clam 's s tru c tu ra l in su ffi­ ciency is to install an " S ” shaped area a1 the dam 's base, which would pre­ vent any spillover from undermining the foundation. 
“ It would not cost much to make the im provem ents the engineers recom ­ mended — something like $4 5 million to $5 million. 
Gonzalez said the city could finance the dam project in one of two ways: 
“ The city could use its own money to make the needed repairs by making 
Ibe project part of a re g u la r bond iSMie. I doubt this has ever been ser­ iously considered. 
“ Or the city could use federal funds 
This kind of project is clearly eligible for funding th ro ug h,the Community 
Development Assistance block grant programs,” lie said. 
Gonzalez noted the city made tenta­ tive efforts two months ago to seek funds from the Economic Development 
Administration and the U.S. Corps of 
Engineers for a repair project. 
“ In view of these agencies’ funding limitations, it might be a long time before any com m itm ent could be ob­ tained, if ever." he said.

ASSOCIATED MTE SS 
NESTIN — Two men trying to cash a forged, stolen $2IMI check ended up iii 
Mil Saturday after they tam e face-to- face with their intended victim at the teller's window of a bank. 
N ancy H a rt, a bank te lle r, was shocked to see Vincent Leon Johnson. 
25, and Frazier Black. 3o, present one of Miss H a rt's c h e c k s for cushing. 
Miss Hart s astonishment grew when s h e learned aller calling police that her apartm ent had been broken into and the checks stolen that morning 

But an Express-News investigation reveals the building was sold to Cana­ dian investors in December, 1974, by 
Coastal States, which owns Lo-Vaca. 

Lo-Vaca’s reorganization is one of m any c o nd ition s sp elled out in a settlement plan which would halt the multi-billion-dollar lawsuit which San 
A ntonio and o th e r c u sto m e rs are pressing against Lo-Vaca and Coastal 
States. 

Corpus Christi puzzle 

San Antonio has already approved the se ttle m e n t p a c k a g e and other customers are now considering it. 
C orpus C hristi a p p e a rs ready to m ake location of L o-V aca’s h e a d ­ quarters an issue in the settlement. 
“ Corpus Christi is basing its arg u­ ment on a building that Coastal no 

 longer owns," an industry source close to lawsuit negotiations told the E x­ press-News. 
On the other hand the settlem ent agreement specifically states the new company “ may reacquire the Corpus 
Christi office building, or be paid therefor” 

One negotiator representing Corpus 
Christi interests says this provision recog nizes the possib lity that the building will revert to Lo-Vaca some­ time in the future. 
There are two apparent ways that could happen. One would be by an out­ right purchase of the building by the reorganized Lo-Vaca, something which could happen regardless of settlement provisions. 
The o ther would be for p resen t 

 owners of the building to default on p ay m e n ts u n der th e ir p u rc h a s e agreement with Lo-Vaca. 
Although Corpus Christi real estate experts say the office market there is glutted, there is no indication that a default is likely or that owners of the building are having any trouble find­ ing tenants. 
The building in question is known as

 firemen hurt; cutbacks blamed 

By MARK VILLANUEVA 
Three fire fighters were hurt in an apartment blaze Saturday and their chief blamed their in­ juries on manpower shortages. 

Dist. Fire Chief Andres Casias said the d e p a rtm e n t has suffered m a n ­ 

 power sh o rta g e s sin ce before D e­ cember. when 55 firemen announced their retirement. 
Fire officials have said 15 out of 39 truck com panies are operating one man short. In December, four 4-man snorkel companies were deactivated in a labor-saving move.

A nice (choke) day 

Dry, wind-blown dust caked a surprised San Antonio Saturday in an unusual weather pheno­ menon which promised to con­ tinue Sunday. 

T em peratures rose to the mid-7Us but humidity hovered near 17 per cent as blowing dust covered much of South 
Texas. Visibility dropped to l l/z miles at several locations. 

Pilots landing at Sun Antonio Inter­ national Airport had to use instrument: procedures at times. Airport officials said visibility tlu‘re dropped to about two miles. 

No flights were reported delayed, however. 

The freak conditions resulted when dust was stirred up in New Mexico and 
West Texas and carried aloft to South 
Texas, according to National Weather 
•Service experts. 

Instead of being blown up from the ground here, the dust filtered down through the atm osphere during the day. 

Emergency room officials at three of the city’s bigger hospitals said there was no increase in asthm atic or re­ spiratory com plaints from the dust. 
Only routine traffic was reported ut 
Santa Rosa Medical Center, Baptist 
Memorial Hospital and Bexar County 
Hospital. 

Many sinus sufferers reported unu­ sual discomfort. 

The dust was carried by the south-. em wave of a cold front which brought blizzards and subfreezing te m p e ra ­ tures farther north on the High Plains. 

W ind gusts locally were reported at, peaks of 2o mph although W ichita 
Fulls said it received 45 mph gusts. 
Temperatures ranged from 54 degrees at Amarillo to 73 degrees ut Victoria. 

Skies iii Sun Antonio are expected to clear Sunday night with (air and mild weather to follow. 

 minor injuries Saturday were battling a fire at an apartment complex under construction on Blanco Hoad just north of HIHO. 
Fireman Byron Cabana, ‘iii. was re­ leased Saturday from Northeast Bap­ tist Hospital after being treated for a back injury. 
Engineer Jack McGinnes, 45. and Et. 
E. L. Strew bridge, 49, were treated ut the scene by EMS te c h n icia n s for shoulder and knee injuries. 
“ W e’ve been awfully lucky we ha­ ven't had more injuries,” Casias said. 
Three men 
“ Ninety per cent of the tim e, the pumper companies arc being operated by three m en,” he said. 
C asias pointed out the p u m p e r trucks are normally manned bv four firemen. 
Casias, who was in charge of fire lig h te rs who handled S a tu rd ay s apartment complex fire, indicated the men are physically tired 
He blamed the situation on having 

 three men trying to do the work nor­ mally done by four-man companies. 
The men sustained their injuries either when they fell down or while pulling water hoses, Casias said 
Overtime 
A solution to the manpower shortage problem would be to have firem en work overtime so crews can work at full strength, Casias asserted 
However, the departm ent will not allow overtime work unless the man-* power shortage becomes more acute, he said. 
The m anpow er sh o rtag e problem will be lessened when a class of about 
4o men com pletes training sessions that begin in April. 
However, Casias said it will be about next Septem ber before the new men are assigned to lire fighting duties.

See HURT, Page SN jailed principal felt hum iliated 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MATHIS - A South Texas school principal says he felt humiliated when he was arrest­ ed, fingerprinted and booked for charges stemming from a stu­ dent’s paddling last week. 

Police chief Milo Contreras and a patrolm an a rre ste d Bill F ric k s on charges of simple assault Thursday after a complaint was filed by Robert 
Serna, the paddled stu den t's father and a former city councilman. 
Contreras said he had examined the 
1o-year-old boy. “ To me. he was in pretty bud shape ... well, you know how it is ... it was all red and he couldn’t sit down The principal said he paddled 

 him three times, but I believe it was more than three or four tim es.” 

However, the Mathis school board found F rid a y that the 
H a rd in g 
E lem entary principal had followed procedure and policy in administering the paddlings. The board also decided to provide legal defense for Kricks in the case. 
Reflecting on the experience, the principal said “ I was a rrested arid fingerprinted and booked and treated as a prisoner. You know, it is not a nice ordeal to be arrested and taken iii like that. It is humiliating when you are trying to do your job as a principal. 
F ric k s was released on p ersonal recognizance by Contreras following his arrest Thursday.

AUSTIN — the nation's only city with a nude living apartment com­ plex is now the nation s only city with two nude-living apartment complexes. 

Organizers of Austin s 18-unit complex that began allowing cloth­ ing optional living last July opened a second such complex Saturday. 

This tim e, though, manager 
I err* Parker, 32, is hoping to go large stale. 

"I his time we’re really staling up.” said the nude Parker as he sipped a beer under the warm 
Central Texas sun at Saturday's opening festivities. 

Nearby, about 21-31 nude men and women frolicked in the icy water of the apartment's swimming pool while a rock band blared. 

“This complex has 78 units and we're going to see if a physical aggression treaty can govern this many people,” he said 

Parker’s tenants must agree to the physical aggression pad. which simply says they won i physically hat ass their olten nudr neighbors 

This complex will feature tenant security forces and sturdy steel gates to protect residents from outsiders. 

The secu rity m e a s u re s , r e ­ modeling and freedom to go nude will hike rent lo about $5(1 per month over that charged bv other a p a rtm e n ts in the h ig h -c rim c neighborhood 
"Ju st like at the other complex, we re not breaking any laws and don't expect any trouble," said 
Parker, who pointed out that there is a waiting list of persons wanting lo live in the first nude complex, 
Last summer, Parker took over a complex that was half empty and losing money, le ss than a year since the clothing-optional pro vision was added, (he complex is full of residents paying Bi per cent more rent. 

 truly the first 18 ol the 78 units in the second complex were opened 
Saturday. Parker said the others would ire opened as remodeling is completed. 

Parker said he might expand hts concept to Dallas or Houston if (his large scale venture is successful. 
He did not mention San Antonio,

WASHINGTON (A P) - P resident 
C arter m et with his special com m is­ sion to Vietnam arni Laos Saturday, hut warned against unrealistic expec­ tations for full information about se r­ vicemen and civilians m issing in ac­ tion. 
The five-m em ber panel, headed by 
United Auto W orkers President Leon­ ard Woodcock, begins its mission Sun­ day. It is expected to arrive in Hanoi 
Wednesday to seek answ ers to ques­ tions about the 2,55o persons listed as missing in action or presum ed dead.

Richard M. Nixon and fo rm er S ecre­ tary of State Henry A. Kissinger to ask alwHit pledges they m ay have m ade for postwar aid to North V ietnam in 1973. 
“ In view of the present ad m in istra­ tion’s probable intention of norm aliz­ ing relations with Vietnam, it becomes essential th at the s u b c o m m itte e be able to document V ietnam ese expecta­ tions in this m a tter,” he wrote. 

C a rte r told th e c o m m is s io n th a t shortly after he took office Jan. 2o, the adm inistration asked 
Vietnamese leaders how soon such a panel could 

 visit Hanoi. He said the leaders “ re ­ sponded very w a r m l y ’’ two w e e k s later, offering a lte rn a te d a te s when they “ could spend alm ost full tim e ” with the visitors. 
Importance 

He said this indicated th e i m p o r ­ tance they attach to the visit. 
Associate White House P re ss Secre­ tary Jerrold Schecter said the g roup would spend three days in Hanoi. 
He said L aotian le ad e rs have ju st recently agreed to let the panel stop in 
Vientiane, but the dates for the visit had not been set. 
He also said an a tte m p t had been m ade to contact Cambodian leaders to let the group visit that nation for the sam e purpose of the Hanoi and Vien­ tiane visits but “ we haven’t had any answer yet.” 
Schecter said the U.S. am b a ssa d o r in Bangkok had been asked to look into a rejiort from a refugee reaching the

“ I am hopeful that this step we are taking will m eet with a p ositive re- sponge and put iii motion a p ro cess that will obtain the fullest possible accounting for our men who sacrificed so much for their country. 
Not unrealistic 
“ At the s a m e tim e , we rec o g n iz e that information may never be availa­ ble on many of th em ,” he said. “ Some were lost over water, or over heavily forested areas and m o u n tain o u s t e r ­ rain. where information may never be found or will be very slow in develop­ ing. So we are not unrealistic in our expectations.” 
T he P re s id e n t sa id he h oped th e com m ission, upon its r e tu r n , “ will report that the Vietnam ese sh are my desire to put the period of war behind us and look ahead rath e r than b a c k ­ w ard." 
Woodcock, in a s ta te m e n t issu ed through the White House press office, echoed the P r e s i d e n t ’s w a r n in g , sa y in g : “ A lth o u g h we s e e k an a c ­ counting for all our missing m en, we should not expect the im possible." 
But, he said, “ I trust th a t we can find a key to the solution of the MIA problem and establish a b rid g eh ead to w ard s n o rm a liz a tio n of r e la tio n s bid ween our two countries,”

GENEVA, Switzerland (A P ) — For the third tim e since 197o, the Swiss are being called to the ballot l>ox to decide whether they should tell som e of the foreigners who live and work here to get out. 
The voting Sunday is on a proposal supported by small right-wing groups and opposed by the nation s establish­ ment. 
Voters also are being asked to decide if they want to lim it the n u m b e r of foreigners g ran ted Swiss citizenship and on a proposed law giving voters the right to revoke treaties entered into by their government. 
Initiatives 
All three proposals are the result of 
“ popular initiatives” that m ust be put to a national vote if backed by 5o,ooo 
Swiss signatures. They are supported by the Republicans and a group called the National Action. Together, the two groups hold six seats in the 2oo-man 
N atio n al 
C o u n cil, th e n a t i o n ’s parliam ent. 
The first proposal wuuld lim it the num ber of foreigners to 12 5 per cent of the populion within a decade. It was prepared by the R epublicans led by 
Zurich p ib lish er J a m e s S ch w arze n - bach, who had also forced th e 197o vote. 
F o re ig n ers now m a k e up 15.3 p er cent of Switzerland’s population of o 3 million. Ari estim ated 25o,ooo would have to leave, al a rate of 25,ooo each year, to meet the proposed deadline. 
Limit 
Ihe second m easure would limit na­ turalization of foreigners to no m ore than 4,ooo annually. It com es from the 
National Action, headed by Valentin 
Oehen, a m ajor in the Swiss m ilitia and a former Schwarzenbach aide who broke away to form his own party.

T h e num ber of naturalizations fur 197o, nut yet available, is expected to be even higher. 
Opponents of the lim itation invoke h u m a n ita ria n a r g u m e n t s an d also contend such m atters should be left to the governm ents of the vario u s can ­ tons, or Swiss states. 

The th ird proposal, also from the 
National Action, was originally alined at a 19o4 Sw iss-Italian im m ig ra tio n treaty that many Swiss held responsi­ ble for encouraging an influx of Italian laborers.

But the draft amendment would also give voters the right to decide on all past and future international ag re em en ts concluded by the Sw iss government.

 little ol’ (rich) Ma Bell 
, 

Bell then went to one little old district court and asked the judge to throw out the PUC order and let Bell right then and there begin charging you and me the whole $296.8 million extra, pending a trial. The Texas Supreme 
Court eventually said no to tossing out the 
PUC order. 

Mind-blowing? Not at all, Sir Bell operates like that all the time. And the lawyers who are trying to do all these things to you are a ratepayers* expense — meaning YOU pay their salaries. 

A * A 

T H W A R T E D B Y the aforesaid district judge. Southwestern Bell now goes up. up. U P the judicial ladder at your expense. 

In other words, whatever in the millions of dollars Big Maw pays Iv r squads of fancy* pants attorneys shows up later in your tele­ phone bill. 

 lf the attorney's win. you'll be paying them 
AND the higher phone rates. 

Zane Barnes in talking to the local Rntar- 

Jans justifies this by saying, and I quote him faithfully: 

“ Our return on capital investment in Texas las» year was lower than in any other state we serve. Companywide, we earned 8.73 per cent oil capital investment. The Texas return of 
8.58 per cent pulled down the company fi­ gure.” 

The differential — 15 of one per cent — doesn't seem to be exactly earth-shaking. 

And Barnes neglected to explain to notor­ ious and members of the news media present why it was that Texas fell below the five-state average at all. 

.TAMES H. A SH LEY, outsted Bell executive who directed many a Bell rate case while commercial manager here, has some useful input in this connection. He says: “ The Bu­ siness Week article of June 23. 1975 staling that Texas was No. I in return on capital investment of all 48 states of the Bell system in ll of the prior 17 years has never been 

 disputed, nor can it be disputed 

“ Rem em ber, that s the whole country we re talking about (excepting Alaska and 
Hawaii, served by General Telephone Co ), not just Southwestern Bell’s five states. 

“ And in the six years Texas consumers 

 didn’t kick in the most to Ma. they were right up there close to the top of the nation's sucker list. 

“ Ah, but then came adversity in the shape of what to Texas Bell topkicks were three dirty words — the Public Utility Commission 

“ Texas was the LAST STATE IN TH E UN­ 
ION to set up a PUC, and it was a ghastly blow to the Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.” 

A SH LEY SAID SW Bell s 1976 earnings in 
Texas were reduced by hordes of attorneys put on the payroll to fight PUC and to keep the 
$29. 2 million Gravitt-Ashley damage suit from ever going to trial. 

“ Otherwise Texas consumers would have netted the company more than any of the other four states, same as always,” he said. 

“ But just to fight me. the widow of T. O. 
Gravitt and her sons. Bell has engaged this staggering array of lawyers: 

“ The Thomas E. Dewey law firm of New 

York; the Burleson Smith firm in the NBL 
Building; the Jack llebdon firm in Frost 
Tower; the Hubert Green firm in Alamo Na­ tional Bank Building: and the Ralph Langley firm in Frost Tower. 

“ Now if they need that much legal clout in a 
$29.2 million lawsuit and related matters, how many attorneys are working on their $296.8 million rate case? 

And C all comes out of the ratepayer’s pocket in the end. 

“ In short, there's simply no way SW Bell can lose. In the PUC case, the bottom line goes, ‘Millions upon millions of dollars to fight the ratepayers — every last cent collec­ tible from the ratepayers.’ ” twice as nice Bernal says

Zane E. Barnes, the South­ western Bell Telephone Co. pre­ sident, is going to zap all yon telephone users one way or an­ other. 

Barnes of course works for AT&T, which last year became the first corporation in the history of the world to rack up $1 billion net profit in one quarter (three months). 

So Barnes comes here last Wednesday and talks poor mouth. 

Ho told the San Antonio Rotary Club that 
SW Bell needs a substantial rate boost in 
Texas. 

As we know . Bell sought increases of $298.8 

 million annually from the new Public Utility 
Commission. After a three-week hearing, the 
PUC granted increases of $57.8 million. 

D RESSED to match the spirit of the day, Mrs. Joe Zuniga watches the bands, floats and mounted horsemen making up the fifth annual 
Paseo de Marzo Saturday. The parade pays tribute to men and women of Mexican lineage who fought and died defending their country. —■ Staff Photos by Pat Hamilton 
IRISH music also filled the air Saturday as members of the Harp & 
Shamrock Society marched through the streets of downtown San 
Antonio. The 1oth annual St. Patrick s Day Parade was sponsored by the St. Patrick’s D ay Parade Commission. 

By DAVID MCLEMORE 
President Carter has not lost his desire to name Hispanics to high government positions, former State Sen. Joe Bernal said Saturday. 
As proof of this desire. Bernal noted he is being considered for high level positions with the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare 
Bernal also noted Mexicun-Ameri- can Democratic Caucus member Kiek 
Hernandez is being considered for as­ sociate director of the Small Business 
Adminstration. 
“ The appointment of Houston City 
Controller Leonel Castillo as head of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service is even further proof of 
Carter s desire to keep his promises to us.” Bernal said 
One of five 
Bernal also said he was one of five people being considered for associate director of domestic programs for AC­ 
TION. the federal agency which go­ verns the Peace Corps and Volunteers 
In Service To America. (VISTA ) 
“ I ’m going to discuss the position 
Monday during an interview with Dir. 
Sam Brown in Washington. D C.,’’ he said. 
“ Th ere’s no com m itment either way. I want to find out exactly what is involved in the job. since a Washington job would mean a separation from my family. 
“ ll would be a tough descision to leave them.” 
Bernal addl'd he is also being consi­ 

 dered for positions with H EW and the 
Housing and Urban Development De­ partment regional offices in Dallas 
Bernal said In* may choose to run for office locally instead of going to work for the federal government. 
“ I’m still seriously considering run­ ning for Commissioner’s Court in Pre­ cinct 2 or for the senate seat held by 
State Sen (Frank) Lombardino,” he said. 
No decision 

“ I haven t really decided which way to go yet." 
“ The appointments of 
Mexican- 
Americans Carter has already made are very significant ones.” he said. 
“ They are substantive and have more effect on policy decisions than those made by former President Ford 
“ I believe we will see even more 
Hispanic appointments to Central and 
Latin American diplomatic posts and in such Justice Department areas as 
U S. attorney, federal judge and U.S marshall." Bernal said 
Bernal was a panel discussion leader during a sem inar on im m igration sponsored by the* Chicano Training 
Center and Mexican-American Unity 
Council at Mark Twain Middle School.

ASSOCIATID W ISS 
A group of re­ porters who went to 
Arizona to continue the work of m u r­ dered newsman Don 
Boites has ended its lengthy investigation of organized crime in the state. 

The series was 

 i released to participating news organizations for use Sunday. A spot cheek showed the newspapers and broadcast outlets had varying plans for han­ dling the information. 
About half the p ar­ ticipants said they would run the series as scheduled, starting Sun­ day and would continue the articles through the planned 23-day span. 
Others, including the 
Arizona Republic for which Bodes worked, said they had decided not to run all the articles. 
Several papers said the length of the stories was a problem. Others said they would delay the start of the series to al­ low time for editing for local audiences 
The Republic printed a statement by 
Mason 
Walsh, assistant pub­ lisher. in Sunday's edi- 
I lions, saying, in part 

Mot all partici­ pating newspapers u ill run the lengthy series 

“ After careful review of these articles, the 
Republic and the 
(Phoenix) Gazette have decided not to publish them as a series. It is quite likely, however,t that some sections will be published concurrent with their publication elsew here..." 
Walsh wrote that some of the m aterial in the series had been pub­ lished previously and ad­ ded 
“ Some of the previously unpublished m aterial contains sta­ tements and allegations for which the Republic and the Gazette have not yet been able to obtain sufficient documentation and proof to justify pub­ lication." 
Star 

Another Arizona paper which participated, the 
Arizona Star of Tucson, said it would start the series on Sunday and would run it with sub­ stantial editing. 
Thirty-six journalists 

 from 23 newspapers, television and radio sta­ tions participated in the six-month project, spon­ sored by Investigative 
Reporters and Editors 
(IR E ), of which Bulies was a founding member. 
Their series totals RMUNX) words. 

Belles, 47, was fatally injured June 2 when dynamite exploded under his car as he drove out of a hotel parking lot. He had been lured to Un- scene by the promise of a big story on land fraud involving m ajor poli­ ticians 

The team project had produced conflicting reactions from jo u r­ nalists.

 the Petroleum Tower. It was ownM by 
Petroleum Tower Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coastal States Gas Pro­ ducing Co., which is a subsidiary of the 
Overall energy holding company. 
Coastal States Gas Corp., which in turn owns Lo-Vaea. 
The gas settlement agreement pro­ vides for creation of a new company; separate and apart from Coastal. 
One of the subsidiaries that would be transferred to the new company is Pe­ troleum Tower Inc., which holds the mortgage on the Petroleum Tower building. So what is being talked about is apparently a paper transfer. 
Corpus Christi and San Antonio are listed in the settlement agreement as alternate sites for the new head­ quarters. Lo-Vaea is presently head­ quartered in Houston. 
Both San Antonio and Corpus Christi want the headquarters because it means several hundred new jobs. San 
Antonio C ity Council has conditioned its settlement on the headquarters bc- 
■ing here. 
Petroleum Tower was built by Coas­ tal in 195K. It was where Oscar Wyatt. board chairman of Coastal, once kept his offices and from where he repor­ tedly made his first fortunes. 
Coastal and Lo-Vaea, then a main subsidiary, began a gradual move to 
Houston in the early 197os. a move substantially completed in 1973. 
Petroleum Tower was sold in De­ cember, 1974. to a group of Canadian investors doing business as N .M . 

PETROLEUM TOWER 

Skalbania Ltd. and Texas ARCO Ltd . according to Coastal officals. 
Sources list the purchase price as in the range of $4 million as amount de­ scribed by lawsuit negotiators as in­ significant in the context of the 
$492-million lawsuit settlement pack­ age being considered. 
But the building has received an in­ ordinate amount of discussion, ac­ cording to one of those closely involved with settlement talks.

K ey votes in

S P E C IA L T O T H E E X P R E S S N E W S 
WASHINGTON - Here is a list of votes of area members of Congress on key roll calls for the week ending March ll. 1977. 
Senate 

Warlike nomination. 

By a 58-4(1 vote, the Sen­ ate confirmed President 
C arter’s nomination of 
Paul C. Warlike to head the U.S. delegation to the 
Strategic Arms Lim ita­ tion (S A L T ) Talks with the Russians. 
The vote in laxer of the 
'JfTttttiination. however, 
M as less than the two- 
•thirds m ajority that 
•would be nocessarx to 
'approve a new S A L T treaty. 

Opponents charged 

 that Wa rake’ti long pub­ lic record of opposition to many U.S. weapons pro­ grams undercut his cre­ dibility as a negotiator and indicated that he xx as a poor judge of Soviet aims and weaponry. 

Supporters insisted that the opponents xx ere quoting out of context re­ commendations xx hich 
W arlike had made at various points over an eight-year period, and that the President xx as entitled to have the ne­ gotiator of his choice. 

Voting to confirm 
Warlike as SA LT nego­ tiator: Benison (I)). Vot­ 

 ing not to confirm 
Warlike as SALT negoia- tor: Tower (R ). 

Water projects amend­ ment. 
By a H5-24 vote. the Senate adopted an amendment to a public works hill intended to force President Carter to spend funds appropriat­ ed by Congress for 19 water projects. The ad­ m inistration had pro­ posed no funds for the projects, m ainly dams and irrigation facilities located in the West, in its amendments to the fiscal 
1978 budget. 

Backers of the water projects amendment ar­ gued that a warning ti 

 the was necessary they claimed that only Con­ gress could decide whether to cancel parti­ cular projects, and that the administrations’s list of 19 projects had been complied “ on the flim ­ siest kind of evidence.’’ 

Opponents of the water projects amendment es­ sentially backed the ad­ m inistration's posit ion that the projects posed serious economic and en­ vironm ental questions that should be addressed before* proceeding further. 
They made clear, however, that they did not support im ­ poundment of appro­ priated funds 
Wage-price action urged 

. WASHINGTON - The 
Democratic majority on the Congressional Joint 
< Leo no in ic 
Committee 
'Saturday called for tough legislation empowering the government to re­ quire advance notice of 
-wage and price increases and to delay those it judges inflationary 
* That form of manda­ tory price-wage controls. 
Pud all non-voluntary measures to stabilize 
Uagcs and prices, have been repeatedly rejected bv the Carter Adminis- nation 
But the JKC majority, iii U s annual report, pre­ dicted that inflation will gain force in 1977. citing the recent increase iii natural gas prices, pro­ spective food price in­ creases. "and the fact that a number of major collective bargaining agreements will in* nego­ tiated this year.” 

‘Restraint’ 

Although a m inority report rejected the mu- jqrity conclusions on mandatory controls, a statement of agreement between the Democrats aud Republicans on the committee called for bu­ siness “ restrain t’’ in pricing decisions, saying 
“ the recent behavior of industrial prices is not metaled in most cases by light markets ” 
The Dem ocratic ma- 
IMH tx also recommended thai President Carter’s budget for llseul 1978 lie 
^ re u s e d by 15 billion lo create jobs, and that 

 taxes be reduced by an additional $o billion. 
Those two steps, over and above Carter's pro­ posed stimulus package, xxould boost the fiscal 
1978 budget deficit bx $11 billion, from $57.7 billion to about $89 billion. 

These recom m enda­ tions run counter to the expressed policy wishes- 

 of the Carter Adm inis­ tration. Spokesman for the President have con­ sistently argued that aux substantial increase iii the federal deficit would be inflationary and weaken business confi­ dence. 
The J E C * rationale for an extra $11 billion of fiscal thrust is that it will be necessary in order to 

 allow the private econ­ omy to grow rapidly in 
1978 

A collateral reason for the extra tax reduction is that it is necessary to prexent an actual rise in the total personal income tax burden after the ex­ piration of this y e a r’s large tax rebate. 

Voting for water pro­ jects amendment: Bent- sen (D). Tower (R ). 

Tax cuts. 
President 
Carter's plan for $5o re­ bates survived a Repub­ lican effort to kill it. The 
House rejected by a vote of 194-219 an attempt to drop the rebates and provide instead cuts in individual tax rates in the lowest tax brackets. 

Sponsors of the move argued that the lower tax rates would bring more permanent im prove­ ments in the economy and that the $5o rebate was too small to In* of any use and was difficult to administer. 

Opponents of the lower tax rates said that the rebate was the best wax to inject stimulus quickly into th<*’ economy and that in combination with other portions of the ad­ ministration’s package it would improve the na­ tion’s economy.

Fatal accident 

POLICE officers try to verify circumstances of the death of Edell W . Key, 48, of 322 E. 
Lindbergh Blvd. in Universal City, whose auto was struck by a southbound 
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad freight about I p.m. Saturday. Officers said the car was traveling east on Basse Road and was apparently struck by the locomotive just behind the driver’s door. — Staff Photos by H.M. Dean Jr. 

Several bills intro­ duced last week to aid farm ers and ranchers xviii also help consumers. 
U.S. Rep. Bob Krueger said Saturday. 
Krueger, co-sponsor of the bills, said one bill, the Emergency Feed Act, will allow loxv-interest loans to farm ers and ranchers to help with stock feeding problems caused by drought and cold weather. 
“ The drought in the western U.S. and in some 
West Texas counties has raised feeding costs far above normal levels," 
Krueger said. 
Another bill Krueger co-sponsored would pro­ vide loans to farmers and ranchers who have suf­ fered damages due to execessive chemical ad­ ditives in feed grain. 
Grocery prices 
“ The combined effects of drought and severe cold weather on farmers and rachers will ultima­ tely hit home at tin* gro­ cery store.’’ Krueger said 
“ The drought in the west has caused major problems in the agricul­ tural area and tin* hard freeze in the Grain Belt will set the growing sea­ son back. 
“ These bills w ill do xx hat is possible to off-set high costs to farmers and ranchers caused bx these natural disasters. 
Krueger also intro­ duced a meat import bill two weeks ago which would cull for different inspection procedures on imported meat 
“ This bill would serve to bring foreign stan­ dards closer to those re­ quired in this country.’’ lie said. 
“ It xviii protect the consumer by assuring a higher quality, safer meat imported into this country. 
It w ill also benefit U.S. meat pro­ ducers by reducing the amount of imported meat.”

Show boosts sound of S.A, 

By BKN KING Jr. 
Entertainment Editor 
The Chamber of Com­ merce might choke at the idea, but rock musicians 
Doug Sahm and Augie 
Meyers proved Friday night they’re two of San 
Antonio’s top boosters. 
After listening to the two hometown boys’ con­ cert at the 
Texas 
Theater, an average tourist couldn’t help but get hooked on the San 
Antonio sound. 
Nowhere else but San 
Antonio would rock mu­ sicians put on a concert featuring big band blues, country and Mexican conjunto music.

Unfortunately though. it seems San Antonians don’t know what they have in 
Sahm and 
Meyers Not more than 
3(H) people came to the theater. 
Danced in aisles 
But the ones who at­ tended made up for the lack of numbers with enthusiasm. 
Besides shouting and whistling, audience members even danced in the aisles. And the musicians deserved the response. 
The concert’s highlight was when Sahm strutted out and flung his singing and guitar playing into a blues number that would've made blues im­ mortal B. B. King take notice. 
The secret to Sahm’s high powered sound is his horn section, known as the West Side Horns, 
Both trumpeter 
Charlies McBirney and saxaphonist Louie Bustos sparked the performance with their playing which combines jazz and a gut-level feeling that s hard to match. 
Together again 
At one point in the show , Sahm was joined by Meyers, who now heads his own band. but was a member of Sahm’s nationally famous Sir 
Douglas Quintet. The band’s musicians were all from San Antonio 
Friday night they com­ bined their talents again to give a fine example of the San Antonio sound basic rock and blues mixed with spunky West 
Side polkas. 
The music isn’t parti­ cularly new or innova­ tive. Its charm is based on the basic feelings it can pull out of an au­ dience. 
During Meyers’ solo portion of the show, he gave a good introduction into what the sound is all about by pulling out a 
Mexican accordion and playing both Mexican and Seguin style polkas 
The only real problem with the concert was the sound mix, which needs to be worked on to [ire- sent a clearer sound. It also needs to be kept 
I down since the theater is a lot smaller than a con­ cert hall.

"lf the Express had not printed it, I would have never know n about it “ 
T h e f o u n d e r of th e s ta te o r g a n i z a t i o n , th e 
Rev. Albert C. Walling, approached Collier at the state meeting in Houston a year ago and asked him to fo rm a San A ntonio chapter.

But he decided to resign, effective April 3o. He is not active in the pulpit at the church, however. 
“ A majority of the re­ g u l a r m e m b e r s of th e church was behind me.

City, county okay on revenue sharing forms 

San Antonio and Bexar County offi­ cials Saturday said proper forms have been filed by the two governments to receive revenue sharing paym ents next month. 

The comments came from City Mgr. 
Tom Huebner and County Judge Blair 
Beeves. 
A U.S. Office of Revenue Sharing spokesman said many governments will not receive revenue sharing funds next month because they have not filed additional forms for funds. 

Huebner said the city staff has not informed him of any problems with the new revenue sharing applications. 
San Antonio receives some $9.5 mil­ 

 lion annually in revenue sharing mon­ ey. Huebner said. 
Reeves also said he is aware of no problems in the county's $4.5 million request for revenue sharing. 

“ We have a fine auditor. We haven't been called up,” said Reeves. 
Their comments came in response to stories from Washington which stated out of 39.ooo local governments eligible for revenue sharing grants, only 25,ooo have completed the required forms by the deadline Friday. 

Without the new form s, the U.S. 
Treasury Department cannot send lo­ cal governm ents the new revenue sharing monies by April 7.

Senate vetoes effort to debate hospital bill 

EXPRESS N E W S CAPITOL BUREAU 

AUSTIN - A bill to provide state financial aid to teaching hospitals fell two short of the ne­ cessary votes to bring it up for debate in the Sen­ ate last week. 
Sen. C het Brooks could manage only 23 of the necessary 25 votes to open debate on his SBB!) 
Monday. 
Tile Pasadena senator is expected to try again this week when Senate roll's change to require only two-thirds of the to­ tal of 31 votes in the up­ per house to bring a bill up for debate. 
Brooks’ bill, and an identical one in the House by Hep. Mickey Leland of 
Houston, would provide state aid to help underw­ rite tin1 cost of medical education at each of the hospitals. 
These hospitals are the 
Bexar, Harris and Lub­ bock county hospital dis­ tric ts. Houston's H e r ­ mann Hospital and the 
Fort Worth Osteopathic 
Hospital. 
A “ yes" vote was to bring the bill up for con­ sideration. 
Welfare 
Legislation to increase p enalties for w elfare cheats was approved by the Senate last week and sent to the House. 
SB 154 and SB 159 by 
Sen. Bill Meier of Euless were approved Tuesday. 
Under existing law. the penalty for unlawfully obtaining welfare aid. no matter in what amount, is a m a x i m u m of $1oo fine and six months to two years in jail. 
SB154 covers welfare fraud, while 
SB159 applies to medical assis­ tance fraud. 
Both place fraud over 
$2oo under the felony code and provide for maximum fines of $5,5oo and from two to IO years in prison. 
F ra u d under $2oo r e ­ m a in s a m is d e m e a n o r but raises the maximum fine to $2.OW and up to a year in jail. 
Massage 
The House passed and sent to the Senate a bill giving counties authority to control massage p a r­ lors. 
11B34 by Houston Hep. 
Gene Green was a p ­ proved by a 129*7 vote. 
The bill gives county commisisioners |>owor to license and re g u la te massage parlors in unin­ corporated areas, includ­ ing prohibiting m assag­ ing of m e m b e r s of the opposite sex and p r e ­ scribing the clothing to 
Ik* worn by employes.

Fort Worth covers those clauses in n a tu ra l gas c o n tra c ts which s o m e ­ times require customers to pay for gas they don’t take d uring periods of low demand. 
The bill reduces to 65 per cent the m axim um am ount of d e liverab le gas a customer may be required to take under any take-or-pay clause. 
It also extends to three years— from two— the amount of time in which a customer may require a producer to deliver gas previously paid for. 
Hotel tax 
A bill raising the local option hotel occupancy tax from three to four per cent was passed by the 
House on Thursday and 

 sent Lo the governor. 
SB333, by Sen. Ike 
H a rris of Dallas, won final approval 85 to 48. 
If signed into law, 
SB333 would allow cities to collect an additional one per cent tax on hotel and motel bills. The city would then be able to collect four per cent and the state three per cent, for a total tax of seven per cent. 

One-half of the first one per cent collected by the cities must be earmarked for convention and tour­ ism promotion. 
San Antonio now col­ lects the three per cent tax and is expected to in­ crease it to four per cent if the bill is signed into law.

EXPRESS N E W S C A PITO l BUREAU 
AUSTIN — Two pieces of legislation of major importance to San An­ tonio will be the subjects of 
House c o m m itte e hearings this week. 
At 2 p.m. Tuesday, the 
House Intergovernm en­ tal Affairs Committee will take up SB459 to re­ peal unlimited sick pay provisions for San Ano- tonio police and fire fighters. 
At tin* same time, the 
House Energy Resources 
Committee will hear the first of two bills aimed at prohibiting the City of 
San Antonio from col­ lecting a percentage of the gross profits of City 
Public Service. 
Indications are that 
SB459, by Sen. Frank 
Lombard inn, will be am ended by the c o m ­ mittee, passed by the 
House and sent back to tin* Senate where final passage appears likely. 
Lombardino’s bill ex­ empts San Antonio police and fire fighters from the present law allowing them to accrue unlimited sick leave for lump sum payment on leaving their respect iv e depa rt ment s . 
SB459, however, does not affect Houston, which will remain under the present law. Houston provides unlimited pay­ ment of sick leave for all city employes. 
Clause 
Lombardino’s bill came to the House with a grandfather clause pro­ tecting all current San 
Antonio police and fire fighters. 
This will allow all present police and fire 

 fighters to continue to accumulate sick leave for lump sum payment until such tim e as SB459 is enacted into law. That provision was added by the Senate before the up­ per house approved the bill. 
But 
Bouse sponsor 
Rep. Ron Bird of San 
Antonio has submitted an amendment to the Lom- bardino bill deleting the grandfather clause entir­ ely. 
It is understood that 
Sen. Jack Ogg of Hous­ ton, who au th o red the grandfather clause, has agreed to the deletion and L o m b a rd ino and 
Bird have predicted this would c le a r the bill quickly in both the House and Senate. 
The hearing on SB459 will be conducted in the 
S p e a k e r ’s 
C o m m ittee 
Room on the second floor of the Capitol. 
HBI 1Bo by Rep. Don 
Cartwright of San Anton­ io will be heard by tin* 
House Energy Resources 
Committee in Room 3o(1 of the Capitol. 
Expense 
HBI 16o prohibits City 
Public Service from us­ ing 11.5 per cent of its gross profits as an oper­ ating expense when fi­ guring utility rates to be charged school and ho­ spital districts. 

At the present tim e, the City of San Antonio collects the 11.5 per cent off the top of the annual gross rec e ipts of City 
Public Service. CPS is a municipally owned utili­ ty and City Hall has been collecting the money in lieu of property taxes. 
The payment has been 
Cartwright files bill on pass-through fee 

EXPRESS NEW S CAPITOl BUREAU 

AUSTIN — San Antonio should not be allowed to make a profit from the pass-through charge for natural gas. State Rep. 
Don Cartwright thinks. 
That's why Cartwright filed IIB1825 Friday on the last day of free-filing of bills in the 65 Legisla­ ture. 

C artw rig h t said he feels so strongly “ about the city making this ille­ gal profit, I have given this bill my priority number for passage in this session." 
Receipts 
The City of San Antonio currently receives 11.5 per cent of the gross re­ ceipts from CPS in lieu of taxes and other money it might receive if Public 
Service were a privately 

 owned utility. 
By 
T exas 
R ailroad 
Commission order, Lo- 
Vaea G a th e rin g Co. is authorized to pass through to customers any additional costs for n a ­ tural gas over and above original prices in customer’s contracts. 
“ When the Railroad 
Commission initiated its p ass-th ro ug h o r d e r . ” 
Cartwright said, “ it was never intended to be a profit making device. 
Every cent 
"Vet, every cent of the pass-through received by 
CPS becomes a part of its gross e a r n i n g s from which the city gets 11.5 per cent,” he said. 
Cartwright explained his bill "would prohibit 
CPS from figuring the pass-through charge into its gross receipts when 

 computing its payments to the city.” 
Rep. Matt Garcia filed 
HBI767 proposing an ex­ panded and more clearly defined bilingual educa­ tion program in public schools. 
Sen. John T raeger of 
Seguin has filed SBHI18 allowing cre a tion of water import districts by the Texas Water Rights 
Commission either on its own motion or through petition of 56 or m ore landow ners in a proposed import area. 
Not passed 
A similar bill, written by Gov. Dolph Briscoe's staff but filed by legisla­ tors, was submitted in the 64th legislature. It was not passed. 
Import districts would be allowed to contract with other political 

 subdivisions, the state of 
Texas or any other state in the union for the pur­ pose of importing water supplies. 
Friday was the d ead ­ line for legislators to file bills without first receiv­ ing special clearance. 
Flood of bills 
It caused a flood of new bills, especially with the 
Bexar delegation which before was averaging a r­ ound 26 bills per week. 
The delegation has filed 
249 bills and resolutions since the session began in Ja n u a ry , accounting for about one-tenth of all the legislation filed up to now in the House of 
Representatives. 
As of deadline Friday, the House had 2,131 bills on record. In the Senate more than 1,166 bills are on file.

 attacked unsuccessfully in court by Bexar County 
Hospital District and 12 school districts. 
C artw right’s bill will accomplish what the dis­ tricts failed to gain in the courts. 
From September 1975 through February 
1977 the 12 school d istric ts and the hospital district have withheld 11.5 per cent of their payments to 
CPS. 
The holdouts now total slightly m o re than $1 million. 
The city has indicated it will sue to recover the funds. 
Tax 
The districts have con­ tented the “ in lieu of t a x e s ’’ paym ent is, in fact, a tax collected by the city from the CPS, which passes it on to 

 customers. 
Since the districts are government bodies, they claim this is illegal under the Texas Constitution, which prohibits one go­ v ern m en tal body from taxing another. 
City officials arc e x ­ pected to testify passage of HBI 166 would cost 
$889,o66 in lost revenue to the city during the first year. 
This would necessitate a tax increase of about two per cent to recover the first year losses, they say. 

C a rtw rig h t also has a n o th er bill (llBl 161) which would prohibit 
CPS from paying tin* 11.5 per cent to tin* city entir­ ely. 
Passage of this legisla­ tion, the city claim s, would cost approximate­ 

 ly $35 million a year or about 36 per cent of the total city revenue. 
This bill has not been set for committee hear­ ing. 

Expected to testify for 
Cartwright's bill are at least two representatives from each of the 12 school d istric ts, as well as 

 r e p r e s e n ta tiv e s of the 
Bexar County Hospital 
District. 
Opposing the bill will be San Antonio City Mgr. 
Tom Huebncr and City 
Finance Dir. Carl White. 
Iluebner and White are also expected to appear in favor of SB459 — the sick pay repeal bill — al­ so on Tuesday.

LES WAAS, finally gets around to raking last autumn's leaves. 
Tomorrow better than yesterday 

By JULES LOH 
' 
ASSOCIATtD PRISS 
PHILADELPHIA - Last week was 
National Procrastination Week. 
Obviously this announcem ent should have appeared sooner but, frankly, nobody got around to writing it. 
This is no put on — or put off. 

T h e re really is a P r o c r a s tin a to r s ’ Chit) of 
America. Inc. It s annual "w eek.” set aside for the purpose of doing nothing, is actually the first week in March, though it is traditionally observed the second week. 
If that is confusing, puzzle it out later. 
That s the doctrine of the PCA: never do today what you can put off until tomorrow. Its slogan is 
“ P ro crastin ate Now!” Les W aas, the PCA pre sident, says it’s the only sensible way to live. 
" It’s surprising how many problems become less important, even disappear, if you postpone them ," he said, yawning. 
Die early 
"People who rush around and never relax and get all worrit'd about being on time are people who die early. Then they are referred to as the late Mr. so-and-so. Why not be late while you’re alive” ’ 
Li's Waas is 5o, slight of build, with sandy hair, a matching mustache and no ulcers. He became pre­ sident of PCA in 195o. when he and a few other unhurried Philadelphians organized the club. 
" I ’m still p re sid e n t,” he said , “ becau se we haven t gotten around to holding our 1957 elections yet. 
“ When we hold them , just think. I m ight be defeated. That would mean I haven’t been president all these years. That’s all right with me because it can get lo be a nuisance.’’ 

Liberty Bell 
As president, Waas has led club m em bers on trips to Italy to see the show at the Circus Maximus, to 
Holland to relieve the boy w ith his finger in the dike, to London’s Whitechapel Bell Foundry, where the 
Liberty Bell was cast, to complain about the crack. 
"We met Douglas Hughes, who is the co-owner of the foundry,” Waas said. “ and pointed out the shoddy workmanship. 
"Ile said the bell would have to be returned in its original carton. He blamed the crack on ignorant colonials who didn t know how to work it. He said the colonials were the crackers — and that we were crackers too.” 
. . . f 
The club also arranges an unbusy schedule of activities closer to home so its 2,IWK! duespaying m em bers can participate. Paying dues on tune, incidentally, incurs a 5 per cent penalty. 
"I really think we have close to a half million members," Waas said. "They just haven t gotten around to joining." 

Membership 

To join, prospective m em b e rs fill out a form 
.which arrives in an evenlope marked "open later." 
Hight now the 1973 m em bership drive is in full swing. 
"A good year to join,” Waas said. "One of our most inactive. 
"That's the beauty of kicking the habit of punc­ tuality. You get to see how things turn out before you commit yourself. We always celebrate New -Year’s 
Eve some time in June, to see if the year was worth celebrating," 
One of the P l’A’s lutist successful projects was its demonstration against the war of 1812. 
"That was a real procrastinator’s w a r,” Waas said. "It began after England had corrected the conditions that caused it and Its last battle was fought after the treaty was signed That s our kind of war." 
Overdue book 
The club also names a Procrastinator of the ^ car. 
Well, most years it does. 
It honored one fellow for his world’s record over­ due library book. It honored Philadelphia’s Meth­ odist Hospital for not placing its cornerstone, dated 
19HH. until 1972. It honored the postmaster general. 
In tile current (I97H) issue of it publication, "Last 
Month s Newsletter,” the club also named the win­ ner of its 1958 essay contest on "How Procrastina­ tion Has Helped Make Life B etter." Winner was 
Mrs. Walter Treftz. Her entry. “ I ll write tom or­ row "

A ction-Express is always delighted to take part in helping people through the Brandeis 
U niversity 
W omen’s 
Book Sale. 
Since 1971, Action-Ex­ press and the Brandeis 
Women have been acti­ vely involved in making the book sale something more than a benefit for the university’s library 
— a worthy cause in it­ self. 
Through contacts pro­ vided by Action-Express, the Brandeis University 
Women began donating paperbacks and other books to prisoners in fe­ deral correctional insti­ tutions in Texas with leftover books and pro­ ceeds from the semi-an­ nual booksale. 
Those efforts later be­ came a national project 

 for the Brandeis Women and they have since dis­ tributed nearly one mil­ lion books to the 3o fe­ deral correctional faci­ lities in the 
United 
States. 
In addition, the local group contacts Action- 
Express to let worthy lo­ cal groups know there are textbooks, reference works and other books left over from the sale. 
Leftover books will be donated to worthy com­ munity and rural li­ braries and schools wishing to make use of these books. 
Yours was such a case and A ction-Express is proud of the partnership it has had with the Bran deis University Women in both of these out­ standing com m unity projects.

Educational program 

I don’t watch much television, but I happened to catch the last three shows of a weekly series called 
“Meeting of the Minds” which was broadcast by 
KLRN-TV on Sunday nights. 
The program was hosted, written and directed by 
Steve Allen. According to the credits, he even wrote the opening and closing musical themes. But what was really terrific about the show was the educa­ tional value rare in any medium these days. 
Four actors would portray a historical figure from different times and places. The historical figures, with Allen, would then discuss and question each other about their historical periods, their lives and their life’s work. 
It was both entertaining and informative in a memorable way. 
For instance, one show had actors portraying 
Emily Dickinson, Attila the Hun, Charles Darwin and Galileo. 
KLRN-TV stopped broadcasting the show a couple of weeks ago. I would like to know if Allen plans to put together another series of ‘‘Meeting of tho 
Minds” soon or if KLRN-TV will resume the series anytime in the future. 
Thank you. You do a very good job with this column. 
E. D 
“ M eeting of the 
Minds” was a six-part mini-series produced in 
U s Angeles by Steve Al­ len. 
“ The complete series was shown. That was and is all that is available to us.” a spokesman from 
KLRN-TV said. 
RLRN TV has not heard from the produc­ 

 tion company, so at this point it does not know whether to expect addi­ tional program s or an­ other miniseries. 
However, it will be re­ shown in a few months, either May or June, be­ cause the station re­ ceived a very good re­ sponse from this area. the spokesman said.

Traffic congestion 

Around 5 p.m.. on weekdays, the traffic between the Lackland AFB main gate and the westbound access road to Hwy. 9o is atrocious. 
Since my work day ends al 4 45 p.m ., I get stuck along with several hundred more people daily. 
I would like lo see an employe or supervisor in the highway department take the 3o minutes to move one or two miles every day. 
If someone of authority should try it, l ’U bet that something, such as timing of the lights, would be done. 
Do you think you can spur any action?

They plan to eliminate 

 the dirt median, install turn lanes, improve the general appearance and

AUSTIN — San Antonio’s shortage of hotel and motel rooms for potential convention goers and tourists may well be reflected in the latest report from the 
Texas 
Tourist 
Development 
Agency. 
While local collections of the hotel occupancy tax were up 22 per cent in 
1976 state-wide. San Antonio showed the sm allest increase among m ajor cities — up only three per cent over 
1975. 
The $1,oB6,539 collected in 197K. represents the city’s 3 per cent col­ lected on hotel and motel room bills 

 paid by guests. 
San Antonio’s total receipts were third highest in the state among major cities, but only half of the amount collected by the two largest — Houston and Dallas — and just double fourth ranked Austin. 

By p ercen tage of in crease. Austin led all m a ­ jor cit irs up 25 poi' cont over 1975 at $526,353 
Houston hotel o ccu p a n cy tax c o lle cte d $2 9 million in 1976. up 21 per cen t over the previous year. 
D allas w as second highest with just over $2 m illion, an in crease of 17 per cen t over 1975. 
El P aso w as fifth, collecting a total of $454,138, a gain of IS per cent over 1975.

When her husband cam e home that night, she said. he told her two men had been hired that day as welders. 
Incensed, Mrs. Austin said she called Bartell 
Zachry to explain the si­ tuation. 
“ B artell told me to prove I wanted to work and could weld by work­ ing in the metal fa b ri­ cating shop and maybe they could place me as a welder later.” Mrs. Aus­ tin said. 
The lady welder said she worked in the shop for seven m o n th s and watched as m an a fter man was hired for the higher-paying w e ld e r’s positions.

San Antonio 

LOS ANGELES TIMES 
When the gasoline vapors exploded, I w as blown out the door onto the sidewalk. I sat on the sidewalk and tried to put out the fire on my pants . . 
. Each time I put my hands on my pants it felt like hot glue. 
Do you know what I m ean? The- polyester uniform was on fire, melting and sticking to me. — Firem an Alfred 
Bold, New York City. 

LOS A N G ELES — Scar tissue has replaced the skin on HO per cent of 
Alfred 
Bold's body. 
But 
2 o years after he was caught in a gasoline explosion at a New York fire station, he is. at the age of 42, thankful to be alive, able to move about in a wheel­ chair and work again. 
The New Y ork F ir e D ep artm ent helped Bold modify his home, enlarg­ ing doors so his wheelchair could pass through, and it created a new job for him: departmental burn officer. 
That Bold survived at all is testi­ mony to the talents of his doctors and to his own physical and emotional strength. 
But more than that, Alfred Bold is living evidence of persistent and so­ m etimes tragic shortcomings in the clothing and equipment worn and used daily by hundreds of thousands of fire fighters from New York to California. 
Known 
T h ese sh o rtco m in g s, which range from fla m m a b le clothing to shoddy m anufacture of self-contained breath­ ing ap p ara tu s and other protectiv e equipment, have been known for years to a small number of government and university fire researchers — and have been deplored just as long by a small core of particularly safety-conscious state and local fire officials. 
T h e p ro b le m s have n e v e r th e le s s failed to attract consistent public a t­ tention. 
“ The paid and volunteer fire fighters across this country are probably the sa d d e st o ccu p a tio n a l g ro u p w h ere protective clothing is concerned.” says 
Thom as Seym our, a senior engineer with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
“ They're asked to work iii normally intolerable environm ents, and yet by and large they don't have equipment d eveloped s p e c if i c a l ly for th e ir needs.” 
In the aftermath of accidents like the one Alfred Bold endured, the Interna­ tional Fire Fighters Onion is showing signs of increasing im patience with less-than-adequate protective gear. 
And federal ag e n cie s, though r e s ­ trained by lim its on their authority, a re b e g in n in g to p r e s s u r e m a n u ­ facturers to incorporate modern tech­ nology in p r o te c tiv e c lo th in g and equipment that in many respects has not changed in the last century. 
Slow 
But a two-month examination by The 
Los Angeles Tim es indicated that the pace of technological improvement has been slow and that the industry re ­ mains virtually unregulated. 
T h e m a jo r p r o b le m s with fire fighters’ clothing and equipment are these: 
• 
Polyester-based fatigues or “ sta­ tion uniforms” like the one Alfred Bold was wearing in May, 1974, remain po­ pular with scores of fire departments from Miami to Denver to Los Angeles. 
• 
W hile m a n u fa c tu r e r s a re g r a ­ dually incorporating flam e and heat­ resistant m aterials in the heavy “ tur­ nout” or “ b u n k e r” routs and pants sold to fire departments, many of these outer protective garm ents still in use and still on the m arket are made of flammable cotton and rubber. 
• The polycarbonate plastic helmets worn by fire m e n in dozens of c o m ­ m u n ities are plagued by num erous design defects.__________________________ 

Also, most helmet designs offer little or no protection to the side of the head or the ears. 
• 
T h e re are also p ro b lem s with ponderous air tanks that run out of gas too soon, and with footwear that offers little or no protection ag ainst punc­ tures. 
F ightin g fires is by nature a. d an­ gerous business. But many health and safety au thorities fa m ilia r with the profession believe it has been made significantly riskier by equipment and clo th in g th a t fa ils to p ro te c t as it should. 
Experience 
In large part, they base this belief more on years of personal experience and conversations with local fire offi­ cials than on hard statistical data. 
Though anecdotes abound, there has never been a continuing, nationwide study of the cau ses of fire m e n ’s in­ juries and the role of equipment fai­ lure. 
The only nationwide death and in­ jury statistics that do exist come from the union, the International Assn. of 
F ire Fighters. According to the asso­ ciation’s most recent nationwide tally, 
119.392 firemen — a little more than half of those on the public payroll in the United States — were reported by their em ployers in 1975 to have suf­ fered 51,313 injuries. 
This averages out to 43 injuries in one year for every UMI firemen. 
The sam e survey showed that 1o9 firemen died in 1973. a figure roughly in keeping with the an average over the last IO years of 9o line-of-duty deaths per IIM).IMM) firemen. 
By this figure, fire fighting may be the single most hazardous job in the 
United States. 
In the absence of better information, som e e xp erts reg ard a gov ernm ent survey in 1965 of the nation’s 5o largest fire departments as still the best avai­ lable look at the role equpipment plays in injuries. 
Clothing 
According to a report of that study — conducted but never published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics — field in­ vestigators judged dress or apparel to be the main contributor in 25.5 per cent of disabling injuries. 
A presidential commission report in 
1973 did stir Congress to cre a te the 
National F ire Prevention and Control 
Administration in October, 1974. 
A little more than two years later, the fire administration is beginning to organize the first national data bank on fire losses, deaths and injuries. It has also launched new research programs and an effort to promote fire safety education. 
But the agency itself rem ains small 
(92 staff m em b ers and a $13 million budget that includes money for outside research g ran ts). The outgoing Ford administration cut its research budget about 15 per cent. 
M oreover, the fire ad m in istratio n has no regulatory powers. 
In some instances, the adoption of new technology has gone badly awry. 
The polycarbonate plastic helmets in general use now , for example, largely replaced m ore expensive and tra d i­ tional leather fire helmets. 

Polyester 

Polyester station uniforms are an­ other example. Their permanent-press crispness has appealed strongly to the fire service's quasi-military tradition of neatness, according to Joseph Clark of the National F ir e Prevention Ad­ ministration. 
The drawback is that the polyester fabrics are made of a heat-sensitive plastic that not only burns but melts as it does so. fo rm in g s o a rin g ly hot globules that tend to stick to the skin.

 admitted to Valerie he’s willing to take another chance with her. 
DAYS OF OUR LIVES: 
Brooke spilled the beans to Bob about Mike and 
Linda. Mike blew up at 
Mickey for using Linda to convince Mike to admit he’s covering for Trish. 
Helen refused to attend 
Julie’s bridal shower for 
Val. Neil could only think of Amanda when Phyllis was in a love mood. Don asked Julie to return to work in his office. 
THE DOCTORS: Jason learned that a photo­ grapher had been tipped off by Paul that someth­ ing was going to happen at the hospital — and that’s when Joanie died. 
Luke told Eleanor that he’d never think of her as an older woman and that 
Barney suffered a mild heart attack after Luke told him the truth about 
Joanie’s death. Maggie and Kyle grew closer on a business trip to New 
York. Steve’s divorce be­ came final. 

THE 
EDGE 
OF 
NIGHT: Adam and Luke caught Darcy before he could kill Nicole. Darcy had tried to smother 
Abby, who later con­ fessed she’d been one of 
Darcy's contacts. Adam decided to defend her after she pleaded that she had no intention of harming Nicole. On the eve of Saxon’s trial, 
Draper suspected hanky-panky between 
Raven and Ansel. Kevin told Geraldine to stop trying to match him with 
Raven. . 
GENERAL 
HOSPI­ 
TAL: Mary Ellen caught 
Mark and Terri in an embrace, then bribed her chauffer to tamper with the brakes on Terri’s car. 
Everyone thought 
Heather took an overdose 

 of sleeping pills but she had faked it with vita­ mins to get sympathy from Jeff. She also plot­ ted to get money from the 
Taylors who offered to raise her baby. Monica learned of R ick’s mar­ riage proposal to Lesley. 
Mark was appointed chief of nuerosurgery. 
GUIDING LIGHT: Rita testified that she'd been with a friend at the time of C y r u s ’ death, but re­ fused to reveal his iden­ tity. Anne grew' suspi­ cious of Jacqueline’s at­ tentions to Hope and 
Mike. Mike scored a point when Rita con­ fessed that all of Cyrus' inheritance was used to pay Viola’s medical bills. 
Barbara was miffed that 
Adam believed in Rita’s innocence 

LOVE OF LIFE: After believing that Tom was interested in someone else, Arlene allowed her­ self to be wined and se­ duced by Ian. Andrew- told Ben that someone has offered information concerning Jim ’s death. 
Cal grew wary of 
Michael. Rick denied 
Cal’s insinuation that he doesn t want any other man to w in Meg. 
ONE LIFE TO LIVE: 
Dorian received a tip about Kevin's wherea­ bouts, but kept her mouth shut until she could use it to her ad* vantatge. Matt forced 
Dorian to talk Joe into rehiring him, but it was no go. Larry and Karen argued about her extra­ 

 vagant wedding plans. 
Vicki learned that 
Cathy’s on the verge of a total recall. 
RYAN’S HOPE: Sene­ ca delivered J i l l ’s pre­ mature baby in her beach house. She insisted on rushing the infant to the hospital and later started hemorrhaging. Dee’s at­ tempted suicide con­ vinced Pat that he must stick by Dee's side, and he refused Roger’s offer to take care of Dee. 
SEARCH FOR TOM- 
MORROW: Bob operated on Cindy via Greg’s in­ structions. John was found guilty of murder in the first degree. Kathy planned an appeal, and 
Jennifer went off the deep end. Erie decided to stay w ith the Phillips. 
THE 
YOUNG 
AND 
THE RESTLESS: 
Kay was miffed that Joann enjoyed Jack’s sexual fa­ vors. But all was forgiven when Joann resolved not to weaken again and the girls planned a trip to 
Hawaii. The charges against Snapper were dropped but the hospital board suspended him until a medical hearing is held. Peg insisted she can’t sleep in the same bed as Jack.

A Cantu scorns seminar 

Mexican-Ameriean ac­ tivist 
Mario 
Cantu charged an immigration seminar Saturday was only a fact-finding ser­ vice for the U.S. Immi­ gration and Naturaliza­ tion Service. 
Cantu said he declined’ to participate because he was convinced of the possibility “ it’s just an­ other put-up job to rein­ force the status of undo­ cumented workers in this country. 
The seminar on immi­ gration and public policy, sponsored by the Chicano 
Training Center and the 
Mexican-Ameriean Unity 
Council, was held at 
Mark 
Twain 
Middle 
School. 2411 San Pedro 
Ave. 
“ I would challenge or­ ganizers of this confer­ ence and its panelists to reorganize this confer­ ence to allow those peo­ ple affected by the re-, pressive policies of INS to participate,” Cantu said. 
Cantu was arrested during a raid on his res­ taurant and convicted in federal court last 
September for shielding illegal aliens. He has ap­ pealed the conviction.

Luckenbach dauber day is Saturday 

SWCIAl TO THE EXPaeSS-MEWS 
LUCKENBACH — When the swallows are return­ ing to Capistrano Saturday, the Mud Daubers are going to be returning to Luckenbach. 
And the town’s citizens are getting ready for the festive return. 
Celebration of the return will include a grudge match washer contest, a song contest on “ When the 
Mud Daubers Come Back to Luckenbach," a dance and several events to raise money for the Hondo 
Crouch “I told you so” Memorial Fund. 
The fund will go for constructing a statue of the humorist-Mayor who died in September. 
The loser of the song contest will be awarded a one-way trip to Buffalo, N.Y. At least six pickers are expected to compete. 
The grudge washer match is set for 2 p m. 
Saturday — Luckenbach time — on the high ground between Snail and Grape creeks. 
The match will be between the never-defeated 
International Washer Congress and the Trinity 
Washer Association of Texas. 
The washer contests, a game allegedly native to these parts, consists of tossing lead disks in a small hole dug in the dirt. 
The Saturday night dance will be at the Lucken­ bach daneehall. Ollie Booker and her Welfare 
Country Band will play. There will be a $2 admission charge. 
Billy Carter — the President’s brother — had been invited to attend the festivities and be Mayor for a 
Day. 
The invitation was withdrawn, however, when 
Luckenbach First Lady Cathy Morgan couldn’t reach him to determine whether he could accept the offer.

ASSOCIATED MESS 

T o flu s h o r no t to flush after using a friend’s toi­ 

 let is one decision A m y 
Vanderbilt probably never had to make. 
But dry wits are only half-joking when they pose such questions as water rationing spreads across drought-stricken 
California. 
A recent survey showed that 
43 com m unities had im ­ posed rationing or were thinking about it. Go­ vernment forecasters predict that because of the worst shortage of rain 

Water-humor floods dusty California 

 and snow in a century, 
California's reservoirs this year will be able to supply at best only 25 per cent the normal water for irrigation and drinking. 
But as residents learn to make do with less water, they’re learning to laugh abbut it too. 
Restrictions are tough­ est in M arin Couniy, north of San Francisco, where each resident ie limited to an average of 

46 gallons a day. 
San Francisco Chroni­ cle colum nist 
HERB 
CAEN w rites about a letter received from 
Marin County with the stamp stapled to the en­ velope to save saliva and the couple seeking d i­ vorce because of “ shower temperature incompatibility.” 
He also tells of a friend who sniffs the air in a crowded elevator and 

 asks, “ is anyone here from Marin County?” 
Children, too, are being taught to look at a serious problem with humor through the adventures of Captain Hydro, a co­ mic book character who wears a cape and says things like “ Holy Hy­ draulics!” when he spots a dripping faucet . 
The com ic book was developed for classroom 

 e 
7-C 
TI ip Side 

 before the drought by of­ ficials of the East Bay 
Municipal Utility District in Oakland, east of San 
Francisco. 
Now, the drought has made the Captain Hydro books a hot item in school districts in Oakland, Los 
Angeles and Santa Clara 
County, south of San 
Francisco. 
The comic books con­ tain exercises to teach 

 o f th e N e w s 

 youngsters how to read their water meters, how to judge the amount of water garden plants need, and how to replace a leaky faucet washer. 
And in

Edw ard J. O’Malley has been named assis­ tant special agent in charge of the San Anton­ io FBI office. 
Special 
Agent in 
C harge 
Jo se p h 
E. 
O’Connell said O’Malley conies to San Antonio from FBI headquarters in Washington. 
He replaces Thom as 
George, who moved into a supervisory post in the Oklahoma City FBI office. 

O’Malley, 41, worked in the planning and in­ spection division and re­ cords m a n ag em en t d i­ vision at 
FBI h e a d ­ quarters. 

He was a supervisor in the intelligence division from 1968 to 1972 and served as the bureau's legal attache in Singa- 
•pore for three years. 

He joined the FBI in 
196(1 after receiving un­ d e rg ra d u a te and law d eg re e s at Vi Ila nova 
University. 

O’Malley is m arried and has four children who will join him in San 
Antonio this summer. 

St. Philip's is on map 

Surveying students have put St. 
Philip’s College on the map. 
A recently completed class project has distinguished St. Philip’s as the only San Antonio area school with a geodetic location officially registered with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Sur­ vey. 
Surveying in s tru c ts oobby Roth decided that a control station tied to the network survey was needed in order to offer a meaningful program to students. 
“ This would provide a reference 

 point for students beginning their basic survey course,” he said. 
The exact position is marked by a thumbtack in the roof of Norris Tech­ nical Center. 
In dedication ceremonies last week. a bronze disc provided by the National 
Geodetic Survey was imbedded in four feet of concrete, 12 inches in diameter. 
Pnotograpns and com putations ut the point have been sent to Washington for verification. 
It will appear as a small triangle on government maps.

Drought threatens hops 

M IK E V A R A 

YAKIMA. Wash. (AP) 
— Beer drinkers face no dearth of draft this year, but drought threatens this year’s hops crop and at least one brewer is dismayed. 
Almost three-quarters of the nation’s hops are grown in the drought- plagued Yakima Valley. 
The dried, ripe flowers of the hop plant contain a bitter, aromatic oil that gives beer its distinctive flavor. 
Boh Sundmacher, a spokesman at Olympia 
Brewing 
Co. in 
Tumwater, says a re­ duced hops crop "is quite a serious matter. The drought will be felt in hops production, and we do not regard it lightly." 
Olympia has a 
12-month supply of Yaki­ ma Valley hops, he said. 

Yakima 
Valley 
, which grows 71 per cent o f the nation's hops, is suffering severe drought 

Bill Harris, manager of 
Hops Growers of Ameri­ ca, said, “ The last I heard, brewers in the 
Gaited States had enough hops on hand to carry them 17 months. 
"It is fairly typical of 
U.S. brewers to have a large reserve of hops stockpiled, because most of all they fear a change in the taste of their pro­ duct if they have to sub­ stitute another type of hops." 
About 71 per cent of the nation's hops production was grown on 21,ooo acres in the Yakima Val­ 

 ley last year. Most of the rest of the hops come from Idaho, Oregon and 
California. West Ger­ many is the other leading hops producer. 
Reduce runoff 
The Yakima valley will receive only about 3o per cent of its normal irriga­ tion water this year be­ cause the drought during the winter is expected to severely reduce the spring runoff from the 
Cascade Mountains. 
"It is impossible to try 
■to assess the impact of the drought on the hops 

 crop because we don't know yet how much water there will he.’’ 
Harris said. 
Wayne 
Hogue, a farmer near Prosser, said, " I think most Ya­ kima 
Valley hops farmers will attempt to grow them this year, but there will he a tremen­ dous reduction in yields." 
Hogue, who is digging wells for his vines, said, 
"Hops take a tremendous amount of water in July and August. If there isn’t enough water the blooms will fall off and there 

 won’t he any berries to pick.” 
It also is difficult to assess the drought’s im­ pact on hops and beer prices. Yakima Valley hops were selling at 63 cents a pound two months ago and now sell for 8o cents a pound. 
Harris said. 
Fortunately for beer drinkers, hops are not the prime ingredient in their brew. Harris said 
“ Many people are su- prised to learn that less than a quarter pound of hops is used in a 31 gallon barrel of beer." 

Plant blast 
T EL AVIV (AP) - A fuse exploded in a high explosives area of a munitions plant Satur­ day. killing two workers.

INS pick talks 

By MARK 
VILLANUEVA 

A former San Antonian who has been designated to head the U.S. Im m i­ gration and Naturaliza­ tion Service said Satur­ day he wants to enforce cu rren t im m igration laws in a hum ane fa­ shion. 
Houston City Controller 
Leonel Castillo stopped short of saying he was the new head of the agency — but he was talking as if he were ready to move into the new job. 
Castillo, treasurer of the State D em ocratic 
Executive C om m ittee, was in San Antonio as guest speaker of the 
D em ocratic Women of 

Bexar County installation reception. 
Castillo met with Atty. 
Gen. G riffin Bell and congressional leaders last week and spoke with them about immigration matters. 

Sit tight’ 

Last week. Castillo said. Bell had advised him to “ sit tight” and li­ mit his public statements until the FBI background investigation and Senate confirm ation proceed­ ings have been complet­ ed. 
He would be the first 
M exican-Am erican to head the INS, an agency of the Ju stic e D e p art­ ment. 
At the reception, Cas­ tillo said he would ac­ 

 cept the position and 
“ lectured” — as he put it 
— on what he intends to do once he heads the agency. 

Word that he has been nominated for the posi­ tion was strengthened when former State Sen. 
Joe Bernal introduced 
Castillo as the “ commis­ sioner-designate.” 

Safety 

Castillo also said he would like to see regula­ tions governing workers’ safety conditions in con­ struction projects to be applied to all workers — whether they are illegal aliens or American citi­ zens. 

“We’re not allowed to 

 exploit w o rk e rs,” he said. 

What m ust be co n si­ dered for w orkers, he said, are safe conditions and adequate wages. 

He was referring to the two cavc-ins at construction projects last week where four laborers suffocated. 

Three of the workers reportedly were illegal aliens. 

“ If we would sim ply enforce the current laws in a more humane and efficient way — we could do a lot better,” he said, when questioned on whether he favored eas­ ing immigration quotas or doing away with quo­ tas.

Tower: 
Look oui for U.S. 

BROWNSVILLE (AP) 
— Americans have been good ol’ boys long en­ ough, said Sen. John 
Tower, R-Tex., Saturday ut the 27th annual Texas 
Shrim p 
Association meeting. 
He suggested Am eri­ cans look out for the 
United States first and then worry about the rest of the world. 
He received spirited applause during a 
45-minutes question-and- answer session high­ lighted by his jabs at the 
Carter Administration, organized labor and government economic intervention. 
“ Uncle Sam has been too nice ail along,” 
Tower told the crowd of about 75 shrimpers. “ We have been the good guys always ... in matters of international economic uilairs. 
The 
United 
States usually negotiates itself into a disadvan­ tageous position in an effort to make friends.’

Ideas, expertise 

Thousand Oaks may just be the most beautiful location of ail the newly-de­ veloping communities in San Antonio. 
Mike Scholl is a young hom ebuilder with ideas and expertise. Put the two together and what do you get? You've got an address and home that could be everyth in g you've been d re a m in g of and waiting for. 
A cu rv in g drivew ay; wrought iron en tra n c e gates enclosing the private e n t r a n c e g a r d e n ; and frosted gla ss entry door etched in an art nouveau floral design serve only to whet your appetite for w h at’s inside. You know you’re entering a houae out of the or­ dinary. 
W a rm e d by the colors of Mexican 
Saltillo tile in the entry and luxurious honey maple beige carpet throughout all living areas, this home is filled with light, space and ideas which will en­ hance your style of liv ing. 
Both the living and dining room s sh a re the high slanted ceiling, with strip lighting which serves to accent conversation groupings, wall art col­ lections or plant arra n g e m e n t s . The living room , with its raised h ea rth fireplace, opens onto an adjoining ce­ d a r deck also visible through th ree dram a tic glass windows on the south wall of the dining room. Entertaining 

 is easy, with an elegant mirrored wet b ar to serve both dining and living areas. 
From the (lining room, you walk into what could be the most beautiful kit­ chen y o u ’ll ever see. A Saltillo tile floor and two patterns of coordinating wallcovering, in brown, blue and off- white batik designs, combine with an island cooking center equipped with 
.Jenn-Air cooktop and grill and chop­ ping block work surface for a kitchen that is not only beautiful but functional as well. Cabinets are stained natural pecan Magic (’bef appliances include the dou b le , s e lf- c le a n in g oven and dishwasher. 
This is a large kitchen with an entire wall, behind folding doors, devoted to storage space for pantry and dishes and c ry s ta l. A c o r n e r b ec o m e s t in* breakfast nook with two large glass garden windows creating a small in­ door g r e e n h o u s e w h e r e h e r b s and flowers can be grown with ease.

The piece de resistance is the m aster suite with its high ceiling, strip light­ ing and double gla ss doors opening into its own walled garden where you can sunbathe in privacy. 
The garden is also accessible from the m a s t e r b ath which is c o m p a r t ­ mented into dressing and bathing a r ­ eas, papered in stunning metallic tan and brown bamboo pattern, with cho­ colate brown fixtures and iridescent 

 rectan g u lar bath tilin a biege-brovvn 
Chinese glaze. The walk-in closet al­ most becomes a room in itself. 
The entire house is 2,638 sq. ft. and is priced at $72,2oo. Beautiful by itself, the holist' is more desirable because of its location. 
Thousand Oaks provides a setting high above the city in a country-like atmosphere. Your prestigious address will in c r e a s e in v alu e t h r o u g h tilt' years because of tin' careful planning of the c o m m u n i t y and se le c tio n of quality builders.

The building-developing firm's two most recent series of affordable hous­ ing are drawn from ingenious floor plans which have revolutionized the market for new homes here by making them much more affordable and use­ ful. square foot by square foot. 
Freedom, Success 
Freedom Homes and Success Homes are modeled in Lakeside, located in southeastern Bexar County off U.S. 
Hwy. 87 outside S.E. Loop 41o; Valley 
Forge, off O’Connor Road between 
Nacogdoches Road and N E. I ll 35; and 
Cimarron, just south of N E. FM 1oo4 east of Kitty Hawk Drive. tlA H IW B M K i r -----------------------------c u m u li 

The two series are aptly named, too. 
Freedom Homes are called that, be­ cause they, literally, set buyers “ free from rent” and put them into a new- world of home ownership. Success 
Homes are named after the series’ un­ ique features that would make the purchase of any a certain success. 

“ Affordability” is a key word for each series. Freedom Homes are priced from as low as $28,5oo; Success, 
$34,ooo. No comparable homes are built for those kind of prices these days; so, Morton/Southwest has a valid claim to leadership in San Antonio are housing. 
Freedom Homes go far beyond the basics, despite their low price range. 
They feature all the frill modern fa­ milies have come to expect in a new home. This, indeed, is just one of the many reasons the series has become so popular. 
Freedom Homes’ three- and four-

Pantry kitchens feature the right kind of appliances to lessen the work­ load for today’s homemaker. Dish­ washers, disposers, ranges, vent hoods and abundant cabinetry are provided in Freedom Homes. All appliances wear the reliable Magic Chef brand name. 

Other extras Morton / Southwest has made available in Freedom Homes are wall-to-wall closets with storage space extending all the way to the ceiling and sliding doors of panel designs, finished two-car garages, utility and work ar­ eas, patios with sliding glass doors, clever blends of masonry and wood for striking exteriors, carpeting of buyers’ choices of colors and styles, Friedrich central air and heat systems and, in

 most, woodburning fireplaces. 
Success Homes vividly reveal that an enjoyable home remains the “ great 
American dream” and one that can be realized without great sacrifices. 

The large amounts of total square footage in the Success plans can be seen in spacious family rooms, separ­ ate dining areas, large family rooms and sizeable living rooms. In fact, the patios for Success Homes are family sized. 
Also included are large, decorative kitchens which boast space-saving built-ins like Magic Chef ranges, ovens, vent hoods dishwashers and stainless steel Waste King disposers. 
The scope of Success Homes, how­ ever. goes far beyond their useful space. The luxury appointments add much to how- they present more than the money’s worth.

3 things looked for await Wildwood buyers 

There’s a saying in the home building profession that there are three things the homebuyer is looking for: location, location and location. 
.’While that may be an obvious exag­ geration, it is true that location is a key factor in tho homebuying decision be­ cause so many elements of a family’s lifestyle are dictated by location 
Fulfill all hopes 
Hay Ellison homes, located in the northwestern quadrant of the city and of Bexar County, offer every choice location feature the homebuyer could hope for: ex c e lle n t schools of the 

Northside School District; easy access to m ajor arte rie s and expressways; proximity to key employment centers like UTSA. USAA and South Texas 
Medical Center, convenient access to prim e shopping m alls; and location beyond the reach of city taxes, thus lowering monthly house payments. 
T his w eekend. 
Ray 
E llison representatives at the Wildwood sales office, just off Bandera Road, are of­ fering an incredible value in new home availability; a four-bedroom, two-bath home with built-in electric kitchen, central heating and air conditioning and en e rg y p a c k a g e for less than 
$27,ooo. 

This is a unique opportunity for th<* young family seeking to b reak the apartment habit and move into a home of their own in the popular northwes­ tern quadrant of San Antonio but out­ side city limits. 

Besides the advantages of quality construction throug h and through, along with the desirable northwestern location, the young hom eowner will find income tax filing tim e a much more enjoyable task because of the tax advantages inherent with hom e ow­ nership. 

F o r those who would like to investigate the possibility of this Ray 

W ildwood really measures up to homebuyers expectations, with its “ back to the country” en­ vironment and its sophisticated, contemporary 

 designs. W ildwood’s wilderness look doesn’t hide its easy proximity to shopping centers and major expressways. 

Ellison home in the northwestern qua­ drant. this weekend they should drive out B andera Road to the Wildwood sales office, where Ray Ellison repre­ sentatives w ill introduce them to a new kind of living and lifestyle.

Patio homes in Royal 
Ridge reflect the charm and grace of Mediterran­ ean styling. 
These energy crafted residences boast more than 2o products and construction techniques that reduce the daily workload and save the owner a significant amount of money in both utilities and m ain ten ­ ance. 
Attention 
A lot of attention has gone into the many de­ tails of these two-, three- and four-bedroom patio homes. With the assis­ tance of Windcrest Deve­ lopment Corp.’s profes­ sional, each buyer decor­ ates the patio home with patterns and textures re­ flecting both personality and taste. 
A patio home is luxur­ ious in styling but prac­ tical and economical. It’s an exciting home, quiet and full of the most mo­ dern features. These in­ clude sound deadening common walls, a truly private patio, fully fin­ ished oversized rear entry garages with elec­ tric door openers and other desirable extras. 
Royal Ridge is conven­ ient to all areas of San 
Antonio. It is midway between Fort Sam Hous­ ton and Randolph AFB, just minutes from Wind­ sor Park Mall. Children attend W indcrest E le­ mentary, White Middle and

Schools, all in the North 
East District.

Camelot attracts multitude 
BURNS CO . home boasts innovative built-in units like this recessed bed alcove complete with foam mattress, toy storage beneath the bed and nearby compartment closet, each helping first-time ho­ meowners reduce the cost of furnishing a new home. The child’s bedroom pictured is featured in the furnished Rockwood model in 
The Great Northwest at 8 7 o 6 Timberwilde. 
Burns Co. builds to save on power 

The added expense of furnishing a new home has been dram atically reduced with. innovative built-in units in quality built, energy-saving homes by the Burns Co. 
Designed to utilize all available space to give you more living space for your money, the’built-ins eliminate the necessity of many furniture pieces most first-tim e ho­ meowners lack. 
Two areas 
A Burns Co. home in 
The Great Northwest or 
Hidden Forest can be the 
“ dream come tr u e '’ answer for the family on a budget who wants the advantages of home ow­ nership without the ex­ pensive task of furnish­ ing a com plete home. 
With built-in units in the kitchen, den and some children’s bedrooms, on­ ly the dining and master suite remain to be com­ pletely furnished. 
Kitchen activity may be centered around an updated version of the breakfast nook plan so popular during the 192os,

 with a corner area com­ plete with built-in seating and coordinated table, all under a shelved plant window’. 

A home laundry center is tucked inconspicuously away behind pantry doors in one plan, and the stacked washer and dryer units are part of the total, top-of-the-line 
GE appliance package. 
W oodburnmg fire­ places, furniture-finished cabinetry and bookcase units are standard fea­ tures in 
Burns 
Co. homes, with one design including a roll-out TV cabinet, completely an­ tenna-wired, under the stair landing. 
Toy storage; draw er and cabinet space built into the walls; and compartmented closets help keep c h ild re n ’s rooms neat and organ­ ized without a lot of ad­ ditional furniture. Some ch ild re n ’s bedrooms boast recessed bed a l­ coves, com plete with six-inch foam mattresses and storage draw ers beneath the bed. 
Every Burns Co. home is built with the proven 
“ Power S av er” con­ struction techniques to reduce the major cause of increased utility bills, air infiltration. 

Burns Co. seals homes during several stages of construction to eliminate the unnecessary flow of air into or out of your home that creates in­ creased heating and cooling re q u irem en ts and increased utility ex­ pense. 
While 91) per cent of the added energy-saving techniques are invisible in a completed home, the differences they make will be clearly visible on your monthly utility bill. 
Burns Co. invites all prospective homeowners to see the advantages of owning a “ Power Saver” home this weekend. 
Burns Co. re p re se n ta ­ tives will be happy to show interested persons the power-saving tech­ niques in homes under construction and the space-saving creative built-in units in their fin­ ished models. 
Located in The Great 
Northwest and Hidden 
Forest, Burns Co. models are open daily, except 
Wednesdays, from noon to 6 p.m. To reach The 
Great Northwest, drive north of NAV. Loop 41o on 
Culebra Road to FM 471, turn left and follow the signs. Hidden Forest is located off Bitters Road, north of NAV. Loop 41o on 
Blanco Road. 

Despite one of the wet­ test Winters on record for 
San Antonio, construc­ tion of new homes in Ca­ melot is hot and heavy these days to meet the growing demand for Ray 
Ellison homes in the popular northeastern section of San Antonio — outside the reach of city taxes but close to the center of action in the growing northeast. 
Many of those looking at Camelot homes are apartment dwellers who believe rising rents and individual metering for utility costs provide a good reason to look into the investm ent advan­ tages of a new home. 
Lower bills 
The economic advan­ tages of adopting a Ca­ melot lifestyle aren’t li­ mited to equity buildup. 
Families are finding that a home equipped with energy-saving features can provide lower utility bills than living in an apartm ent that doesn’t contain energy-savers. 
Ray Ellison homes constructed since J a n ­ uary, 1976 feature com­ plot e~ 
-en ergy-saving packages designed to save up to a third or more on utility costs. The 
Ellison energy package consists of extra wall and ceiling insulation which exceed VA/FHA sta n ­ dards; double-paned win­ dows; special caulking around windows and doors; power attic venti­ lators; and. energy-efficient air eon-’ ditionm g and heating systems. 
While Camelot econ­ omies are many and var­ ied, the fundam ental economy of reasonable monthly payments is still a reality for Ray Ellison homeowners. In Camelot, homes in the popular 
('lassie series are availa­ ble in the mid-$2os with 8 

 per cent VA financing available. 
Whatever the peaceful serenity of the Camelot lifestyle living is anyth­ ing but dull in this excit­ ing neighborhood which serve as a showcase for dynamic Windsor Park 
Mall and many large su­ perm arket drug stores and specialty shops es­ tablished in the area. 
The three R ’s are taught to Camelot young­ sters in excellent North 
East D istrict schools where emphasis is placed on education excellence and varied extra-curric­ ular activities which in­ still leadership and initia­ tive. 
M ilitary com m uters find Camelot located squarely between Fort 
Sam Houston and R an­ dolph AFB. The conven­ ient location also means that leisure moments can be spent strolling on the 
Paseo del Rio or at the 
Institute of Texan Cul­ tures downtown.

1 wall-to-wall carpeting throughout. 
The apartm ents are planned for privacy, with either a private enclosed patio or a spacious bal­ cony Secluded walkways and courtyard parks add to the atmosphere of pri­ vacy and spaciousness. 
Convenience is another important consideration at Maison de Ville. There are large outdoor storage spaces, and covered parking for each apart­ ment. abundant parking

“ live in a fishbow l.” 
There’s an inner circle of privacy.

SOME r estival weekend 

■■■■■■■■■ 
Ball, picnic will reopen 
1867 chapel 

Restoration is nearing completion on the historic chapel of Southwest Craft 
Center, formerly Old Ursu- line Academy. 
The spacious French-inspired chapel, built in 18B7, will be rede­ dicated with a series of festive events the first weekend in April. 
A Grand Ball, reception and gourmet dinner will be held in the chapel and gardens of the Center at 7:3o p.m. Saturday, April 2. 
Television's gourmet chef Julia 
Child has planned the menu. 
At 12:3o p.m. Sunday, April 3, the grounds will become a vast picnic area for a Country Garden luncheon featuring a showing of 
French couturier fashions from 
Frost Bros. 
Tickets for the black-tie ball are 
$5o per person, and the wicker basket luncheon, $15, with pro­ ceeds to benefit the multi-faceted 
Southwest Craft Center School. 
At 8:15 p.m. April 3, the Mo- liere-Lully comedy ballet “ Le 
Bourgeoise Gentilhomme’’ w ill be presented in the chapel by the 
Trinity University Department of 
Music under the direction of Ger­ ald Benjamin. 
The ballet will be repeated at the same hour Monday. 
The public is invited, and there is no charge for the ballet either evening. Reservations should be made in advance by calling the 
Trinity University Music Library. 
Events of the three-day festival will honor Mrs. Jack Frost and 
Mrs. Sam Maddux Jr. 
H andsom e invitations which went into the mails this weekend from Southwest Craft Center read: 

On the occasion o f the opening o f the Chapel, ice 

 wish to express our appre­ ciation to Mrs. Jack Frost and Mrs. Sam Maddux Jr. who love and cherish the historic buildings of the Old 
Ursuline Academy. 
In 1975, Mrs. Frost made possible the purchase of the 
Chapel, 
First 
A ca d e m y 
Buildings, Priest's House and River Gardens. 
In 1977, Mrs. M addux made possible the restora­ tion o f the Chapel, Vestry and Sacristy. 
Che Chapel was built in 
1867, designed by architect 
Fra n cois Gi ra u d. 

The Old U rsuline Academy buildings are considered among the most authentic examples of 
19th century 
French country architecture in the United States. 
Chairmen 
Miss Helen Hogan is general chairman of the festival. Co-chair­ men are Mmes. Patrick S. Chum- ney, Prates S. Seeligson, Reeves L. 
Smith and Ralph Rowden. 
Mrs. Thomas Berg is president of Southwest Craft Center, and 
Mrs. Donald Saunders is chairman of the board. Many members of the 
Center are assisting w ith plans for the celebration. 
In the future, the chapel will be used for a variety of exhibitions, lectures, concerts and other pre­ sentations arid gatherings. 
Tickets for the CJrand Bull and garden fashion luncheon may be secured by calling the Southwest. 
Craft Center.

Parisian fashion for gala 

Fantasy designs from 
Yves Saint Laurent will star in the French fashion gala to be presented at Southwest 
Craft Center April 3. 

The show, to be staged by Frost 
Bros, during a Country Garden luncheon at 12:3o p.m., is part of the weekend celebration marking the restoration of the chapel at the craft center. 
In addition to the spnng-sum- mer Rive Gauche collection by 
Saint Laurent, the Sunday after­ noon will include selections from such other Parisian designers as 
Givenchy and Dior. 
In one sequence, models will dance through the gardens of Old 
Ursuline Academy in fantasy fa­ shions which will turn them into 
“ Laurentlan peasants ” 
For his “ ritzy peasants,” Saint 
Laurent is offering tiered and flounced skirts, stand-up collars on shirts and blouses, can-can in­ fluences in afternoon and night fashions, full and fuller sleeves and prophetic short skirts. 
Corselette 
His already famous revival of the corselette continues into this latest collection — sensually teamed with bouffant skirts or pantaloons which he calls “ Zouave pants." 
The garden luncheon audience will also see his sassy and widely cuffed Bermuda shorts paired with full-sleeved shirts, hraid- bound jackets or corse Ie ties 
Other accessories in the spot­ light will include: flower printed shawls, cotton serapes with gold piping, gold bangle bracelets and necklaces, feather and ruffled chokers, corselette bolts, ruff Us! bedjackets above soft dresses, etc. 
As always, this Saint Laurent show will Im* a lively mix of fashion aud show biz!

M ARK and Barbara Hunter sit in the lap of a shady oak by the M orris swim m ing pool 

Hundreds of oaks and elms wrap their leafy arm s around the home of Don Morris. 
Located at 245 Foxhall, this lovely old country home is nestled in six acres of wooded hill country. It will be part of Christ Episcopal Church’s 4oth annual Home and Garden Pilgrimage, 
March 26, 27. 
Morris, a landscape architect, pur­ chased the home 2o y e a rs ago and since that time has been rennovating, remodeling, adding and planting. 
The entrance is marked by a path­ way of semi-tropical foliage, azaleas and spring plants, leading to a tall, latticed doorway. 
Sunroom 

A two-story sun room , an addition to the home, provides a breath-taking view of the swimming pool and cabana. 
Floor-to-ceiling glass gives the room an outdoor feeling which is enhanced by a profusion of palms and baskets of fern. 
The room is accented in crisp tones of chocolate brown and white. 
A deeds cabinet from London is used as a table between two suede chairs in this contemporary setting. 

The living room, with heavy beamed ceiling, presents a more traditional flavor in warm earth tones. A magnifi­ cent cypress knee hangs over the fire­ place and carved shore birds by J.A . 
Middleton accent a coffee table. 

Used as a side table in this room is a campaign chest once owned by Gen. 
Jonathan Wainwright. 
Sliding glass doors in the dining room provide a view of a small patio and fountain created with ce ra m ic

Up the patio walk a visitor finds himself in the midst of a beautiful vegetable garden reminiscent of the herb and vegetable gardens at Mt. 
Vernon. 
Raised beds enclosed with railroad ties and bordered with pansies are watched over by a stone statue of St. 
Francis from Guadalajara, Mexico. 
As one exits down the driveway to the walk, a final view is of a statue by Jean 
Cauthorn am id the oaks and e v e r­ greens.

You’re invited to meet No. IOO 
Spring styles to be shown 

 pointed out by another member of the family 
Several stories were written by others of the Women’s Depart- mant staff while I was on vacation 
— bringing the total number in the series to IOO today. 
After questioning the families and nodding in agreement with many of the remarks made — many would say. “ Now you know all about our family, tell us about yours.” 
So, today, as the final story in the series titled. “ All in the Fa­ mily.” I’d like to introduce you to my family. —LOUIS HAASE 

We tried to have a variety of occupations, faiths, interests, backgrounds and areas of our city. 
Some families had only one child and others had a houseful. Some were first marriages and some were happy second times around. 
One family had one parent only. 
Families ranged from quiet to talkative, from multi-interests to one dominant concern, from ath­ letic to book-wormish and from native San Antonians to trans­ plants from everywhere. 
Inter-family pride was strong in most homes, and special talents and achievements were usually 

 ents learned of secret ambitions of their children — and the children giggled as they learned how their parents met. 
Each home I entered as a stranger and left a houseful of friends. I have a scrapbook of treasured ‘thank yous.’ 
Many families received calls from friends or schoolmates that had gotten lost through the years. 
Some reported they were “ cele­ brities” in their church, neigh­ borhood, school or job. 
All of the families interviewed were recommended by staff members, readers or community leaders. 

Since April 2o, 1974. I ve been snooping in family closets and rattling family skeletons to report on the various lifestyles of happily married families in our commun­ ity. 
I've been welcomed into elegant formal homes and comfortable smaller homes with the same spirit of southern hospitality. 
Homemade pumpkin pie, fancy cookies, sparkling wine. hot coffee, iced tea and even Mexican egg nog have been offered in a show of welcome by many of the families.

Returning service boys were honored in our church in the mid-4os and the girls sat up front with them. 
Truman Haase was one of those handsome Army boys back from .Japan and I sat next to him We had known each other since Sunday School — but today he was the ro­ mantic returning hero. 
We started dating and by the Christmas before graduation from Brack­ enridge (also his alma mater) I was wearing his ring. A year later — I was 18 and he was 21 — we married. Last Ja n ­ uary was our 29th anni­ versary. 
My mother made my wedding dress from white 
.Japanese silk brought back by Truman for his bride-to-be 

 man and room mother in elementaries and Ximitz 
Junior High. 
Truman then took over 
FTA duties since I was working late on PTA night. 
He served as chairman, treasurer, vice president and presi­ dent at Nimitz and held office at Lee. He earned a 
Texas Lifetime Member­ ship.

Truman is a practical optimist who gets things done. I'm a cautious dreamer who enjoys hav­ ing a husband with a strong character to lean on. He’s managed to keep his sanity no matter what the children or I come up with — and he’s always there backing us up or picking us up. 

Tiruman and I tried to give our children examples to live by. 
And next to love, the most im­ portant thing in family life is laughter. —Lois Haase 

Truman 

Truman was working for Southern 
Pacific 
Railroad, like his Dad 
He worked midnight to 8 a.rn. for 2o years of our marriage. (That’s a story in itself.) 
He is now Yard Office 
Supervisor with 32 years sen ice. 
In seven years we out­ grew tin* house we had built. First, there was 
Susan Ann; five years later. Richard Wayne, and two years later.

Jim 
Bennett, a director and actor now living in Pacific 
Grove, Calif., came home for a week to visit his mother, 
Mrs. Alpha Bennett, at Canyon Lake. 
A graduate of Edison 
High School and North 
Texas w ith a m ajo r in speech, Bennett taught speech and d ra m a at 
H arlandale Ju n io r High and Fo x T ech before moving to California. 
Currently, he is writing his m a ste r's th esis at 
Trinity on Robert W . An­ derson and the loneliness theme in his plays. Dur­ ing a two-year stint in 
Okinawa, Bennett direct­ ed several plays by An­ derson. Bennett was at 
Okinawa as director for the D ep artm ent of the 
A rm y’s Recreation S e r­ vices. 
At night, he taught speech classes at the 
University of M aryland’s 
O kinaw a B ra n c h . The main reason Bennett took jobs in that part of the world was for the travel. 
He was able to spend 
C h ristm as in B a li and 
New 
Y e a r ’s 
E v e in 
Bangkok. 

Returned 

W hile Bennett was in 
Okinawa, the island was returned to the Japanese. 
“ P ric e s im m e d ia te ly skyrocketed.” he said. 
Washing the car once* a week is a necessity on 
Okinawa because of the salt sp ray. T he p rice went up from $1.25 to $5 and $H overnight.” 
For the past year, Ben­ nett has been on the road in this country, directing outdoor pageants in the sum m er and m u sical shows that he wrote for 
Jerom e ll. Cargill of New

York. 
This is the company that helped the 
San 
Antonio 
Ju n io r 
League produce several of its m u sica ls a few years ago. 
Bennett’s next produc­ tion will be in Prairie du 
Chien, W is ., where he w ill help the hospital auxiliary put on a benefit show opening March 25. 
He will travel directing shows until the end of 
April, when he returns to 
Pacific ti rove “ to lie on 

 the beach.” He is looking forward to the annual re­ turn of the Monarch but­ terflies. The butterflies hang on the trees for a couple of months, and people watch them with binoculars. 

It's against the law to catch, m u tilate or des­ troy one of these b u t­ te rflie s, and th ere s a 
Satin fine to back it up. 

 mely ecology conscious, and also has laws to pre­ vent anyone from remov­ ing an ything from the beach—shells, rocks, plants, driftwood. 
This town is only three blocks from M onterey w ith its C an n ery Row that 
Jo h n 
Stein b e ck made famous in the book he wrote about it. B e n ­ nett said that all the sar­ dines left in the late 4o’s and the canneries closed. 
“ Now, the area is beau­ tiful.” 
Although Bennett has acted in many plays, the last time he wras in front of the footlights was a year ago. He was in “ The 
P rim e of 
M iss Je a n 
B ro d ie ” in C a rm e l at that time. 
Since he has been d ir­ ectin g , 
Ben n ett has traveled all over the w orld . He c a n 't help com parin g the lack of re stra in t in going an y­ w here in the U. S. in comparison with all the red tape of passports and visas needed to tra v e l any d istan ce in other countries. 

Future 

Bennett says he has no idea what the fu tu re holds, hut 
“ it's rather exciting. I hope to get into 
TV com m ercials on the 
West 
Coast and even­ tu a lly be m anag in g director of a theater.” 
Hopefully it will be in one of his favorite cities. 
Without exception. San 
Francisco is his choice for No. I in the world and 
Hung Kong comes next. 
"Hom e is where your routs are,” says Bennett, and he thinks of San An­ tonio as home. Converse­ ly. he says, "It took me three and a half years to not feel Texan. 

“ It was a necessity. In 
C alifo rn ia, Texans arc* constantly talking about 
Texas, and after a while, people avoid you. I'm so enthused with California, that many people ask me if I work for the Chamber of Commerce.”

District VTI director is 
Mrs. D L. Timberlake of 
Uvalde. Mrs. K B. Jenks of San Antonio is vice director. 

Ability and attitude are the keys to women’s success. 
Anne Schiller stressed this point as she talked about her behind-the-scenes job at 
KTSA/KTFM radio stations. 

Ability and seniority have taken her from "doing a little of everything" to her current position — news and public service director. 
A woman news director is rare in broadcasting. Mrs. Schiller is believed to be the onlv woman holding this po­ sition at a_radio or television station in San Antonio. 
T ra d itio n a lly , o n-th e-air people move up to director positions. Mrs. 
Schiller went a different route. Sue progressed upward through adminis­ trative channels to office manager and then to her current position. 
"I never wanted to be on the air! My forte is administration,” she said. 
"I would rather be a workhorse than a bareback rider!” 
Mrs. Schiller has a big responsibility and she likes it. 
"I go with newsmen to press confer­ ences. Attend meetings and see what is required of broadcasters. Think up features. Work with personnel and station license renewal. Every day is different.” 
Smooth 
She believes a successful radio sta­ tion as far as ratings are concerned, usually has good management. 
"lf a station runs smoothly on the air. it must run smoothly off the air,” she said. 
Mrs. Schiller believes the greatest advantages of merging news and pub­ lic service is that public service infor­ mation often leads to interesting news and public affairs features. 
"News in radio is different. We try to come up with local information and 
Aging isn’t reason for our look

 features on current issues that will interest everyone,” she said. 

 ourselves as a mass 
“ We think of appeal station.” 

Setting aside a work area for the news department, that once worked out of a file draw er, is a change Mrs. 
Schiller made after becoming news director last August 

She is now researching subjects, such as P a re n ts Anonymous, drug crisis counseling and out-of-town youth program s to expand public service features. 

Mrs. Schiller becam e hooked on broadcasting when she got a sum m er job as the receptionist at RTSA. She wanted to quit school and work full time, but Bernard W aterman, station owner, refused to hire her until she completed college. 

“ It was too late to switch majors, so I graduated from the University of Texas in 197o with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and newspaper sequence," she said. 

Scholar 

At the U niversity of Texas Mrs. 
Schiller received a scholarship from the local chapter of Women in Com­ munications Inc. 
She was one of the first woman ma­ 

 keup editors on the Daily Texan, cam ­ pus newspaper, and served as m an­ aging editor on the college's quarterly m a g a z in e . 
T exas 
E n g in e e r and 
Science. 
Mrs. Schiller says the field of broad­ casting is wide open to women — on- the-air jobs as well as other areas. 
"W omen are going into sales, be­ coming disc jockeys — engineering is w ide open to women — especially those skilled in electronics.” 
At RTSA a great deal of emphasis is placed on advancement within the sta­ tion, she stressed. 
"Our success is built on pride and professionalism.” 
W aterman's pet project is to develop youngesters in the broadcasting in­ dustry. He is concerned about quality broadcasting, Mrs. Schiller said. 
RTSA operates a student intern program in cooperation with the San 
Antonio Independent School District and Trinity University. As coordinator 

 for this program. Mrs. Schiller helps the interns develop news judgment and guides them in developing public af­ fairs programs. 
Advice 

Mrs. Schiller's advice to organiza­ tions that hope to promote projects through the broadcast media is: 
Update your media mailing list about every six months to insure your re ­ leases go to the right person. lf the project is ongoing, stay in regular contact with news and public service directors so they will know their information is current. 
Include your name and daytime tele­ phone number on all releases. 
Respect the format of each station. 
They know how to reach their listeners most effectively. 
“ While these practices may seem obvious, you would be surprised how few organization actually adhere to them." she said.

Do you feel you are not looking your best these days? Have you started to notice changes in your appearance that you don't like? 
Not all of these are caused by a d ­ van cing y e a rs , and m any can be stopped before they take hold. Learn the “ whys” and try some solutions. 
DEAR JENNIFER: I am developing broken veins around my nose and on nn cheeks. How can I avoid it? — Sue 
K., Belleville. 111. 
Broken blood v e sse ls can be hereditary but also can be caused by a high intake of alcohol or exposure to heat over a long period of time. 
High blood pressure and pregnancy also can contribute, as can a blow to tin' skin or pressure applied as in re­ moving blackheads. 
Check out this problem with your physican. T here is a m ethod of r e ­ moving these red lines that is simple and usually successful but can only be performed by a physician. 
Furrow 
DEAR JENNIFER: I am getting a furrow in my forehead and lines at the corners of my eyes. Will night cream help to stop these from getting worse? 
Donna D., Wilmington. N.C. 
Check out where this problem stems from. Could it bo poor eyesight, tension or stress? Is thi* the culmination of too many years of suntanning? 
Night cream will lubricate the skin. 

 but it won't make the wrinkles disap­ pear. What will help is having your eyes checked and joining a yoga pro­ gram to rid your body of tension. 

Use a sunblock to protect from the aging effects of the sun and w ear sunglasses in bright sunlight to avoid squinting. 
M ake-up 

DEAR JENNIFER: 
My make-up looks dry and caked. I have been very happy with the brand I use and faithful to it for years. What s gone wrong? — 
Sonya A., Spokane. Wash. 

Fart of looking your Iwst is to keep changing your cosmetic products as your skin requires change. 

A make-up that worked years ago when your skin might have been nor­ mal to oily will appear heavy on a now-dry skin. Often, make-up should la* changed from winter to sum m er as well. 

Buy a new light liquid make-up base and use it over a moisturizer. It should solve your problem.

 rest of the plant, especially its leaves, that interests today’s commercial producers. 
The dried leaves are ground into a greenish-gray powder and mixed with hot water to form a paste that is spread on the hair. It is left on the hair for about an hour, and then the gloppy mess is washed off and the smell neutralized with a vinegar rinse. 
Ideally, it will leave hair shiny, thicker-looking and with a subtle color that will wear off with time, generally two to four months. And since 
It coats the hair and doesn’t dye it. it isn’t used like a dye to cover gray hair. 

 istration does some policing oi henna imports, but on a limit­ ed basis of spot-checking, ac­ cording to Bans Eilerman, director of the Division of Cos­ metics Technology’. 
Henna has been permanent­ ly listed as a permitted pro­ duct for use as a hair dye for some time. The agency is con­ cerned primarily with its safe­ ty and, apparently, it has not been proven dangerous. Even its detractors agree on that point. 
Allergic reactions to henna are rare, unlike problems with laboratory-made colors. What concerns the professionals, however, is the possible dilu­ tion with other products. (One brand, for instance, states that it contain! proteins. A chemist who has tested the product says it contains only 2o per cent henna.) 
Esthetic 
But the anti-henna faction objects mostly on esthetic grounds. Results are difficult to control, either because of unskilled operators or the un­ reliability of the product itself, jects -ontrol, ei u .* 
Henna can vary from batch to batch, they say. Harvest conditions affect the quality, just as grapes produce varied w ines. 
Also, a batch of supposedly all-henna may have other plants ground with it: indigo, a blue dye, for instance.

N EW YO R K - We seem lo be heading for a year of red-haired wo­ men. At a recent fashion show, four out of live of the professional models had hair ranging from light copper to maho­ gany. 

Dress designers like red hair because it sets off the creamy colors promised for spring and summer. 
Suddenly, one’s best friend has reddish glints in her usually plain dark hair and she swears she doesn’t dye it. 
She doesn’t. lier hairdresser, who knows for sure, will tell you that the red glow comes from probably the oldest cosmetic known to civilization: Henna. 
Cleopatra may have used henna, which would account for her sometimes being de­ scribed as red-haired. Her subjects certainly did; henna stains have been found on the nails of Egyptian mummies. 
Mohammed is said to ha\e dyed his beard with it and made it popular among his followers. The early Israelites knew it; the camphire of the 
Song of Solomon is usually translated as henna. (The word is actually Persian.) 
In India and North Africa, henna is still used to stain the 
, feet and hands and to paint

 patterns on the skin for festive occasions. 

In the Middle East, even the manes of horses are dyed with henna 

Iii this century, henna moved westward and pro­ duced some of the impossibly colored hair of the 1929s and 
193os when the redhead reigned and movie stars such as Clara Bow had “ it." 

Most of the early henna came from Egypt and the name Egyptian henna is still found on brand names. These days, it may come from Iran, 
India or Morocco. 
New fad 
In the last decade, the back-to-nature movement has made a new fad of henna. 
Henna is a plant product, therefore natural and good for von. argue the ecology-mind­ ed. 
There is some disagreement 
•among professionals on the last point, but henna definitely comes from a plant v It is a small shrub (Lawsonia iner- mis) grown mainly in the 
Middle East and the Mediter­ ranean coasts of Africa. 
The Bible mentions the per­ fume of its flowers, but it is the 

Those facts about henna are reasonably clear. From then on. one gets widely divergent opinions from its fans (who at­ tribute it with remarkable qualities, such as the control of dandruff), and its detractors 
(who warn that some hair may turn, if not green, an unplea­ sant vivid orange, or it may even mat the hair badly if other chemicals have been used on it). 
Since many of the purveyors of henna are small importers, there is much confusion on the subject. Some hair-dressers will not divulge the name of the little man in Brooklyn who supplies them with the Aca­ pulco Gold of hennas.)

And in this corner we have 

A tough, fascinating political ittle may he shaping up for lizabeth T aylor’s new hus- ind. John Warner. 
John has m ade no hones about oiling to stay in politics and he and izabcth have been criss-crossing the de of Virginia ever since their m a r­ ine- 
Although he hasn't come right out id announced, it is g e n e ra lly as- med that W arner's running for the mate seat Republican Sen. W illiam 
■jolt will relinquish next year. 
But the same seat is being seriously 
•i'd by a strong vote-getting Republi- m. fo rm er V irg in ia Gov. Linwood 
Olton, a good friend of W arner’s. 
In fact, John was an early supporter 
Holton's gubernatorial cam paign and I think the decision to go was lade right here in my living room in eorgetown,” recalls W arner. 
“ I was th in k in g of p u ttin g up a laque saying ‘The discussions in this tom led to the election of the first epublican governor of Virginia s,nce ie Reconstruction.’" 

Holton chalks up the huge crowds that turn up for Liz and John to cele­ brity interest, not to poli­ tical support. 

Now a lawyer in Washington and a evident of M cLean. V a ., Holton is liking of moving back to Richmond od taking a year off for campaigning. he only stumbling block is the finan- ial demands of sending three children a college. 
Holton chalks up the huge crowds hat turn up for John and Liz to cele­ rity interest, not to political support. 
I know Virginia. I could beat John,” ays Lin. 
What does John think about all this? 
It's far too early to make any judg- nent. People have been enormously eceptive. We have 2o or 3o appear* inees in the next OO days and these nvitations have come to us. we haven’t anight them ,” though he admits that jig turnouts to see his superstar wife md him self cannot be equated with 
/lites. 

Liz and John 

“ I hope as many strong candidates as possible enter the race.” savs the smooth W arner. “ I think the people should have a wide choice. I certainly welcome all challenges. 
“ Lin would be tough opposition but ho would be tough and fair. I think 
V irginia is quite anxious to see some new faces and new ideas and that's where I would have the edge on h im .” 
So the battle of next year may be between two w arm frie n d s , both smooth politicians — a good-looking, popular ex-governor with a m ischie­ vous grin and a perky, cute-looking wife, against a handsome ex-cabinet officer with a world-renowned spouse possessing the most devastating orbs on the globe. 

S u r firises 

You just never know what to expect any more, even at black tie dinner parties. At the W hite House you could end up being Am y's dinner partner regardless of your age or sex. 
At the Moroccan ambassador to the 
U N ’s fancy dinner in New Y ork, a doctor who carries his acupuncture needles with him demonstrated how painless it is to have one jabbed into your hand. 
Dr. Josue Corcos carries the little needles everywhere in a silver cylinder on the end of his watch chain because, he said, “ You never know when you may be able to help someone." 
Before the dinner of 31) disbanded, the New York internist, who has be­ 

 come an expert on acupuncture and developed the m etal ear clam p for reducing appetite, stuck a needle near the edge of a guest's ear to help her tennis elbow and it stayed there for 2o minutes while she mingled and chat­ ted.

Said the boss of Forbes magazine, he did not buy the Social Register as reported several weeks ago. “ I have honestly nothing whatsoever to do with i t " His name got involved because his son is on the board because his daughter-in-law ’s fam ily has money invested in it. 

The rem arkable Forbes was plan­ ning to balloon his way across the 
Atlantic to attend the annual balloon meet. June 1o-12, at his Chateau de 
Balleroi in Norm andy, but his sons vetoed the plan. No wonder! Nobody has made it yet. 

Form er Ambassador and Mrs. John 
Davis Lodge, just up from Buenos 
Aires where they stayed with Ambas­ sador and Mrs. Bob H ill, said they had a marvelous time although the Hills had 14 guards w ith m achine guns guarding them and the ambassador's limousine was equipped with a gadget that throws a smokescreen around the car in case of terrorist attack. 

Neither Sir Peter nor Lady Rams- botham knew when asked about it five days later that a $5o,ooo coat had been stolen at their party in the Kennedy 
Center atrium following the New York 

City Ballet's performance of “ Union 
Jack.” 
It seems that when the chairman of the ballet company. John Samuels, and his wife arrived at the party on the top floor of the KC. Mrs. Samuels hung her scrumptious, floor-length fur on a rack that had no numbered checks or atten­ dant. When she went to pick it up it was gone. 
“ Is it possible,” asked an unbeliev­ ing detective of the U.S. Park Police over the telephone, “ for a Russian sable coat with matched and signed skins to be valued at $5o,ooo° That's more than the mortgage on my house,” groaned the man. 

Yes. dear fellow, it's possible. It's hard to imagine putting that much on one s back but some people have Santa 
Clauses, tooth fairies or husbands who come up with such surprises. 

B ritis h 
A m bassador and 
Lady 
Ramsbotham heard about the theft when they attended the Smithsonian benefit dinner dance at Lord and Tay­ lor's new area store. 
The Ramsbothams made the very first purchase when they ordered a new game that probably describes their life in Washington. It was called The Rat 
Race, a Game for Social Climbers. 

Being traditionally subjected to more of that than anyone it should be a breeze for them.

C oUeetomania is epidemic! 

Collectors and i their collections can j be fascinating. Or they can be colossal, greedy bores. It all depends on how they collect — and what. 

America has been on a co llecto m an ia kick for the last IO y e a rs. The a m a s sin g of hu m b le objects from our recent past has merged into the hoarding of hum ble ob­ jects from the present. 
This phenomena began with a word: nostalgia. 
Lumped in this category is anything and everyth­ ing m ade betw een 192o and 194o. 
T h e re a re even m u ­ seum s devoted to these- ite m s. 
L ib ra rie s a re drenched with full-color books docum enting the life cycle of everything from Coca-Cola items to postcards. 
When I was a child, my friends and I used to col­ lect for fun. But w hat chance does a youngster have today? Before you can say “ s h a z a m ," an enterprising adult dealer has cornered the market on comics, beer cans and movie posters. 
I'm not really worried about the kids, though; they’ll come up with so­ m ething new' to collect. 
Meantime, it’s the adults who worry me. There is alm ost a frenzy in the way they collect — as if acquiring more and more like objects is a matter of life and death. 
Craving 
According to psychia­ trist Dr. Jam es M. Fisch, 
“ lf you take the combin­ ation of using m aterial objects to fill up what is missing in real life, plus the insatiable craving for the approval of others, collecting becom es yet another addiction of our tim es.” 
Now, do you still want 

It's the (iduIts who worry me. 
There is almost a fre n z y in the w a y th e y c o lle c t— as i f acquiring more a n d more like o bjects is a m a tte r o f life a n d d e a th / 

 to be a collector? Then are a few pluses: Some of the most interesting peo­ ple in the world are ser­ ious collectors. In fact, you may decide to just collect people who col­ lect. 
Are you p la n n in g to collect as a fu tu re in v e stm e n t? T hen be p re p a red to w atch the rise and fall of your in* vestment in price guides and at major auctions. It is p ossible to slow ly, carefully build up a col­ lection of superexpensive 
Steuben glass, stiver. In­ dian or other items. 
By doing a little r e ­ search . you'll discover 
G eorg ian silv e r and 
Steuben g la ss co stin g from $3o-up. But these are already “ accepted" items. Much riskier are huge sum s spent on tad objects. 
Obstacle 
The biggest obstacle to c o lle c tin g is re p ro d u c ­ tions. A flood of repro­ d u ction s can at least temporarily kill a popu­ lar collectible — or even a popular antique 
H ow ever, y o u ’ll d is ­ cover that the best de­ signs and items are now reproductions of re p ro ­ ductions. It doesn’t m at­ ter whether a Sheraton piece of export china is a reproduction, but a r e ­ pro d u ctio n from what era? 
Many related items are necessary for a serious co llection . 
M anu ­ facturers’ catalogs give not only a line on prices as they once were, but also information on how many items were origin­ ally made. This accounts tor the rising prices of oh! catalogs and catalog re* productions. 
Old photographs and even some not-so-oid are still tieing bought for a nickel a pack And as ra­ dio prem ium s were the most popular of the nos- talgia-wave collectible*,

M ouseketeer hats and 
S tar T rek o b jects for years. The way things go in collecting, those kids may have enough valua­ ble “ Trekkle" loot to see them through college. 
Editions 
Since the 194os. the field of lim ited-edition plates has exploded into un lim ited lim ited e d i­ tions, branching out into bells, p a p e rw e ig h ts, sculptures, m edals and art prints. But it can only pique the cu rio sity to wonder what is limited about a run of from 5,ooo to 1o,ooo id en tical ob ­ jects, numbered, signed or otherwise. 
P a r t i 
Collecting the new 
Antiques 

Still wondering how or what to collect? To keep you from going wild in all directions, I have cate­ gorized a few objects: 
Knicknacks (Bric-a- brac) — These are small items which may consist of m ore than one of a single item (a collection of cups, mugs, kitchen­ w are) or one-of-a-kind 
“ sing les.'’ totally unre­ lated but s im ila r (a pressed-glass cuke stand, cruets, ironware objects. 
Art Deco ceramics). 
Keepsakes 
— Objects with a personal value that may have been handed down from generation to generation in one family. 
E xam ples are g ra n d ­ m others’ thim bles, sou­ venir spoons, lockets, g r a n d f a th e r s ’ m atch safes, pipes, toys, m other's sewing or but­ ton boxes, linens, wed­ ding galaa or porcelain, souvenirs and objects gi­ ven for b irth d a y s or holidays. 
Nostalgia — Generally accepted in this category are objects from the late 
1921 Is. “His. ‘4os and now . early ‘5os. 
Fine Art Objects 
— 
May be old or new and m ade of any m aterial; classification depends on craftsmanship and beau­ ty. S teuben g la ss. St. 
Louis p a p e rw e ig h ts, silver and various Orien­ tal pieces qualify. 
Primitive or Country 
— A c a n ing made from a wooden cigar box, hand­ crafted work tools, toys and sculpture m ade by rural craftsm en are ex­ a m p le s of p rim itiv e s . 
Furniture may be primi­ tive or country 
Clubs 
Collectors should seek out clubs devoted to their in terests. Since collec­ to rs ’ clubs don't want professional dealers for m em bers, the collector can safely learn the value of his objects and how to trade and sell them. 
Strangely enough, tine of the best ways to locate the club in your area is through the local dealers, who may at least put you 

Thoughtful m others h a v e been sta sh in g a w a y Mouseke­ teer hats a n d 
S ta r Trek ob- jects for years. 

 in touch with an o th er collector. Specialized ex­ h ibits and shows are places to meet other col­ lectors. 
Adding to a collection is no easy m atter these days. The best sources still are garage and house sales, and auctions and antique shops are alway'* fertile hunting grounds. 
Church rum m ages and thrift shops are places to pick up nostalgia items inexpensively. 
Many m agazines aud p u b lic a tio n s, like

K d iu i conjure me ti ho n of your tam ily pas! as 

 well as from friendships with fellow collectors. 
Unless you are a m il­ lionaire who buys com ­ p lete c o llectio n s at a time, it may take years to round out your collection. 
But that’s the fun of col­ lecting — it takes a life­ time. and then some.

Television 
DEAR A BBY. 
I see where a lot of people have protested the advertising of various unmention­ able” products on TV. but as far as I'm con­ cerned. there are worse tilings on television to complain about. 
I refer to the content of some of the daytime pro­ grams Some of the game shows I used to enjoy here have gotten so dirty 
I have stopped watching them. 
Also, whatever hap­ pened to that command­ ment about taking the name of the Lord in vain? 
I ’ve heard 
“ God,” 
“ Lord” and even “ Jesus 
Christ” used that way, and I find it very offen­ sive. 
The 
“ hells” and 
“ damns” I've gotten ac­ customed to long ago, although I still feel it sets a bad example for our young people. 
Now. to whom shall we direct our complaints on tin1 above? — O FFEN D ­ 
ED IN CONN 
DEAR O FFEN D ED : 
Write your local TV sta­ tion, and ask them to for­ ward your complaint to the head of the network. 
DEAR ABBY:

Paul does is to salt every* tiling that requires sea­ soning — and I mean he s a lts it up but good! 
Abby. lie doesn't even 
TRY it first; be just pours the salt on. 
People look at him in disbelief. At the home of friends. I ’m sure they think there’s something wrong with their food. 
Shouldn't he take a lit­ tle taste first? And then if he likes things saltier, he could add a bit more salt instead of doing it iii these great broad ges­ tures. 
Or am I w rong to criti­ cize him? — 
P A I L ’S 
W IFE 
DEAR W IFE: 
If your husband likes salt, lie should he a little more subtle in applying it. especially when he’s a dinner guest. 
And he should take a token taste first, even though he knows lie’s go­ ing to add more salt. 
Paul’s craving for salt may be embarrassing for you. but it could have more serious im plica­ tions. Tell him to mention this to his physician. 

Recently, I quoted a reader’s question on ‘‘how’ does meno­ pause affect a man?” Now comes this terse cry for help: 
Dear Dr. Menninger,, 
We need help. Male menopause—what is your opinion on this subject? 
What can a wife do to help during this time and what can help her? — 
Mr. and Mrs. L. R. 
The term 
‘‘meno­ pause” really applied only to the woman, whose menstrual periods and capacity to repro­ duce cease in mid-life. 
This occurs with the de­ cline of female hormonal production, which starts anywhere between age 35 and 55. 
Also known as the 
“ clim acteric” or 
“ change of life .” this period presents physical or emotional problems for only some two out of every five women. And generally, the physical reactions are not severe—hot flashes, ex­ cessive fatigue, feelings of emotional instability. 

P ila t e 
More significant are the psychological adjust­ ments of the woman en­ tering a new phase of life. 
Some become quite de­ pressed at no longer be­ ing able to be a mother. 
Others experience a new sense of sexual freedom without the fear of preg­ nancy. 

INSIGHTS psychological 

Dr. Menninger invites your comments and questions. Write to him in care of the San Antonio 
Express, P.O. Box 2171, 
San Antonio. Tex., 78297. 
Because of the volume of mail, he cannot answer each individually hut will handle questions of gen­ eral interest in his co­ lumn. 

Men neither have the same clear decline in hormonal activity, nor do they have any obvious physiological “ change of life." 

However, they can ex­ perience a significant psychological crisis of mid-life. It is a time for reviewing one’s accom­ plishments and expecta­ tions in life. 
Some men deny they are getting older. They strive to be as masculine and virile as ever, and then discover that they are not. 

Unable to perform sex­ ually as easily, consis­ 

 tently and effectively as when younger, the man may start to avoid sex altogether, fearful of the embarrassment of fai­ lure. 

There is no simple for­ mula for helping couples like Mr. and Mrs. L R. work out their sexual problems. It is helpful when the partners can talk openly about the feelings each has. But that’s easier said than done. 

It is also important to have a solid base of fac­ tual knowledge about sexual matters. 

I'm aware of two excel­ lent books on the subject for older people: “ Sex 
After Sixty,” by Dr. Ro­ bert Butler and Myrna 
Lewis Harper & Row, 
New York. $8.95 and “ The 
Fires of Autumn,” by 
Peter Dickinson Drake. 
New York — Copies available from the author for $5.oo, 47 Chestnut 
Avenue.

New- York 1o538). 

 older women play in the so-called “ male change of life.” I am 61. My friends mostly range from 5o to 7o, and I am amazed at how some of these wives turn their husbands off. 
Sox becomes passe. It is cither “ He is too old," 
“ It is something I never liked," or “ It is wrong at our age.” I have seen so many of these women pull away from their husbands, both physical­ ly and mentally. 
I think middle-aged women should become the driving force, making the first move, becoming the feeler, the patter, the kisser. Sex with my hus­ band is not as often, hut just as good. I praise him up. not run him down. 
A male friend of ours, age 62, was caught in an­ other city recently with a 

“ lady of the evening.” 
His wife is shattered, but this same lady told me that she does everything she can to avoid his sex­ ual advances. She uses every excuse from a sore back to TV. 
Perhaps the male men­ opause is more the female want-a-pausc! 
Sincerely. Mrs. M. P.

Offices fill up on North Side 

General Office 
Medical-Dental 

B ?, RICHARD SMITH 
XmSS-NEWS BUSINESS EDITOR 

If you want to know where a city is thriving and where is it is not, look at its office markets. 
That’s what one local research team has been doing, and its preliminary findings may prove to be eye-openers. 
Among the findings, the Express- 
News has learned the following: 
• Within two years, nearly all available first class office space will fill up on the booming North Side. 
• New buildings will be needed soon to catch the overflow from the crowded north central business district 
— but few of any substantial size are being built now. 
• Of all available leasable space in the city, 79 per cent is occupied. 
• The office market on the South 
Side is practically negligible, as the city growth patterns stretches in other directions. 
• The market for medical-dent a I office facilities in both the downtown and North Side are healthy. 
Make public 
The findings are from a report Routh 
& Co. is preparing for Greater San 
Antonio Chamber of Commerce and 
North San Antonio Chamber of Com­ merce. The report is expected to be made public later this month. 
Routh & Co. is an office locator, leasing, management and sales firm. 
Routh Vice President Russell Kyse says the report was made by surveying the owners and building managers of 
156 office buildings in San Antonio. 
In the survey, they asked such things as the building’s total amount of lea­ sable office space in square feet, how much was occupied and how much ad­ ditional space they leased last year, says Kyse. 
The report is divided into general 

The dem and fo r additional space m ay send up office prices 25 per cent within two or three years 

 business office space and medical- dental office space. 
Kyse says the data was obtained on a confidential basis, and the firm is not allowed to divulge any particulars about any one building or business. 
He points out the report will be pub­ lished yearly. 
Some resistance 
“ We did meet some resistance in com piling the in fo rm atio n ,’’ says 
Kyse. “ Some owners didn’t want to advertise their number of vacancies. 
They felt it could have a negative effect on anyone considering to rent their property. 
Kyse says the report was instigated by inquiring investors and money lenders for the construction industry — and by some doubts of the accuracy of past information. 
“We kept hearing the same figures being thrown around for the past few years,’’ he says. “ These figures will differ substantially from those." 
“Overall, we found that total occu­ pancy for all the available leasable space was running at 79 per cent. 
Many people have felt that figure was lower,” savs Kvse. 
“Within the next 12 months, the office spaces in the north central business district will probably fill up. 
“ When the north central business district becomes saturated, the busi­ ness districts in the Northeast and

O N L Y a I O -m onth su pply office space exists in the north central business district, and fe w facilities of any substantial size are bein g built. 

Northwest and the central business district will begin to catch the over­ flow,” he says. 
“ But it's not as if people will be moving from the north central business d istrict buck to downtown, ifs that the whole office space market is getting a lot health­ ier.” he says. 
“ However, the absorption rate is mounting, but there's not that much space becoming available because no one is building any new buildings now ,” says Kyse. 
The absorption rate is the amount of additional office space an area needs to meet the demand each year. 
As the office space becomes rarer. he says, it will become a landlord s market. 
More bullish 
“ They will be a lot more bullish about their rates,” he says. "They have been clobbered for the last two years by increases in utilities and taxes. But they’ve had to keep down rates to stay competitive.” 
“We'll be looking at 7o to SO cents a square foot within the next two to three years for first-class office space,” he says. 
That space, he says, is currently renting for 55 to 62 cents a square foot. 
With the spreading into other dis­ tricts by businesses seeking more el­ bow room, the building crews will swing into action. 
“The trend at this point is that the north central business district will be the hottest area for the builders.” he says. 
Like crazy 
"As soon as the builders and their money lenders notice the dem and, they’ll start building like crazy, possi­ bly overbuilding — like what happened three years ago ” says Kyse. 
At that time, builders emerged from a rather slow period of activity with a frenzy of construction which caused a market glut that is only now beginning to subside. 

ROUTH report divided the av aila b le office space for San Antonio into general business and m edical-dental office space categories, noting their geograph ical areas. It found general business faces a sh ortage of offices in som e areas, w hile the m edical- dental m arket is ge n e rally healthy. 

“ The building cycle is like that,” says Kyse. “ It s either feast or fa­ mine.” 
“ In 12 to 18 months, though, the trend may be towards other areas, de­ pending on the availability of the land.” he adds. 
Available 
According to the Routh report, about 
625.119o square feet of office space is available for leasing in the three north business districts. 
Based on lust year’s leasings, Routh 
& Co. estimates the North Side busi­ ness areas will need about 69(1.(KHI square feet of new office space in tilt' next 12 months. 
But the areas’ current supply of of­ fice space is only about 625.ooo square feet, the report noted. 

Thus there is only about a 1o-month supply of North Side office space. Kyse points out it takes longer — usually 
12-18 months — to construct office buildings of any size. 
The result: A shortage of office space. 
The total net leasable space for the 
North Side is 3.1oo.ooo square feet. Of that figure, the combined percentage occupancy for the three northern dis­ tricts is 79 per cent. 
Still oriented 
“The downtown district hasn’t done all that badly in its occupancy rates,” he says. "You still have the major ho­ spitals. the courthouse and m ajor banks there. A lot of businesses have to operate there. 
However, vacancies for the down*

But that absorption figure won’t stay- level, he says. Because of things hap­ pening downtown like the restoration of Market Square, it may climb to 
225.ooo next year. 
"The completion of the North Ex­ pressway will have a very, very posi­ tive effect on the central business dis­ trict." he says. 
“The fact there is a good market of quality office space downtown has been proven,” says Kyse. “The rapid filling up of the Frost Bank building estab­ lished that. 
“ Although many people have felt the downtown area has been a distressed area, the top flight buildings, includ­ ing those which have been refurbished, are staving above 8o per cent in the occupancy rates," he says. 
The report lists the average rent for high quality buildings in the central business district at 62 cents, 51 cents for medium quality buildings and 34 cents per square foot for lower quality buildings.

Economic debate is political one as well r 

BY 
PALL LEWIS 
NEW yon* TIMES SI*VICE 

NEW YORK — What is the hest way to stimulate business in the United States assuming you agree that it needs pepping up? 

All the experts agree the economy needs pepping up, but how do you do it? 

The question has been raised increasingly in recent weeks as Con­ gress, numerous special interest groups and in­ num erable economists have begun to attack 
President C arter’s plan for reviving the economy. 
The 
P resident has asked for a two-year package of measures that would include permanent tax reductions, tem por­ ary tax cuts and high public spending. 
But many voices have 

 been raised in criticism of the mix of measures he is proposing. Some think the adm inistration should put more empha­ sis on perm anent tax reductions. Others want to leave tax rates un­ changed and increase public spending instead. 
At first glance, the ar­ gum ent seem s to be about economic theory. 
Which kind of stim ula­ tive action would in­ crease economic activity and lower unemployment most efficiently?

 the government should stimulate the economy by prom oting spending when times are hard 

But there are differing methods of doing so. 

( a r t e r would inject roughly $16 billion of new- spending into the econ­ omy this year and next. 
But in 1977, about half would come from a tem­ porary a tax cut in the form of a one-time rebate on last year’s taxes, with the rem ainder divided between public works program s and a small permanent tux reduction. 

On the other hand, next w ar would see alxiut halt the stim ulus coining from governm ent-fin­ anced works programs, with the balance in the form of permanent tax reductions for business and individuals. 

However, the House 
Ways and Means Com­ mittee. which has been considering this plan seems suspicious of tax cuts and more interested in public spending to create new jobs.

Those in favor of a tem porary tax cut a s ­ sume that it would take the form of a one-time rebate on last y e a r’s taxes. They prefer this approach to stimulating the economy for two main reasons. 

First, it would inject im m ediately a much larger sum of money into the economy than a |>er- manent tax cut, which would only he felt gradually over the course of the year. 

Second. the govern­ ment would be preserv­ ing its sources of revenue and when the economy recovered would have more tux receipts for spending than if it enact­ ed a permanent cut in tax rates. 

As a result a one-time rebate tends to be sup­ ported by liberal econo­ mists and politicians who want to get unemploy­ ment moving down ra ­ pidly but do not want to sacrifice their plans for more public* services and spending

Bv HOBART ROWEN 
W ASHINGTON - P robably no top official in the Carter ad­ ministration is more forthright and candid than 48-year-old Ray 
Marshall, the soft-spoken labor econom ist and negotiator who runs the sprawling Department of Labor. 
Marshall has spoken lip for the con­ troversial Hum phrey-H avvkins full em p lo y m e n t and grow th b ill, and against voluntary wage-price gu ide­ lines that might edge into a formal controls system. 
And — in an adm inistration co m ­ mitted to the opposite proposition — he thinks public service job money will provide “ a bigger bang for the buck” than tax cuts or rebates. 
But the energetic former professor

It's certa in that M arsh all won't carry the day within the Carter ad ­ ministration oil all of Ills views. His strong feelings on how best to control inflation spell an outright conflict with

W A R R E N GERBER is skeptic 

The S ecretary’s sk ep ticism about any kind of gov ernment intervention in 
Hie wage-price area reflects exactly not only the attitude in the trade un­ ions, but among business leaders. 
It is, therefore, a curiosity that bu­ siness leaders have expressed som e worries about Marshall. They suspect that he is too close to too many posi­ tions taken by organized labor. 
Marshall is aware of the criticism, blit shrugs it off. “ I’m close to collec­ tive bargaining philosophy. Some in­ terpret that as tieing close to unions. 
“ But I don’t think that collective bargaining is necessarily a thing for the unions; it s a thing for society.” 
This commitment, however, logical­ ly leads Marshall into some areas that lift eyebrows in the corporate board room — and in the Pentagon. For ex­ ample, Marshall says “ it’s only good m anagem ent’’ to think of setting up som e g rie v a n ce procedu re for the armed forces.

Splitting stocks can double investor’s fun 

IO S ANGELES TIMES SERVICE 
NEW YORK—If some­ one bad bought 
IOO shares of IBM Corp. in 
1914 (it was then called 
Computing - Tabulating- 
Reeording Co.) for $2,75o and kept it. what would it be worth today? 
Hold on to your portfo­ lios. 
That 63-year-old in­ vestment would have burgeoned to 
74,15o shares worth $2o.5 mil­ lion today. That's if none of the rights had been exercised and no addi­ tional money invested. 
In addition, $4 million in cash dividends have been paid during the period. 
That original 1oo-share purchase has seen 12 splits and 26 stock divi­ dends. 
Ever-increasing 
That’s one example of an ever-increasing phenomenon! 
— com­ panies are splitting their stocks. According to a recent survey by Stan­ dard and Poor’s Corp., in 
1976 there were 99 splits of three-to-two or more 
(including stock d ivi­ dends of 5o per cent or more) among New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 

Second store opens 

A second Shopper’s 
World Store has been opened here, according to Charles Siegel, com­ pany vice president. 
The store, located in the Las Palmas Shopping 
Center, will contain 
12,ooo sq. ft. and feature full service. 
“ The overwhelming response to our SW 
Military Drive Shopper- 
World store prompted us to open a second locution in Las Palm as,” said 
Siegel. 
The store’s manager will be Jesse Leal, he said. 
The addition of the new atorc will bring the total number of stores in the 
Southwest chain to twelve. 

While it wasn’t a re­ cord, it was more than double the 46 splits of 
1975 and nearly triple the 
35 of 1974. 

And if the stock market downturn is reversed soon, an even greater number of splits can be expected this year. In tho 

 past, stock splits activity has generally reflected — though with a little delay 
— the direction of the market as a whole.

LOCAL employment agents have been certified by the National

Technically, a split provides no immediate advantage to the stock­ holder. True, following a split, he owns more shares, but his propor­ tionate holding relative to the total shares out­ standing is not changed. 
But stock split action is often considered bullish and frequently is preced­ ed or followed by a rise in the stock of the company. 
"Nowadays most com­ panies raise the dividend when they split the stock,” says Merle Wick, 
New York Stock E x ­ change vice president in charge of stock lists. 
“ The dividend return is much more important in the eyes of investors than it was five years ago.” 
Wick said Big Board officials talk to manage­ ments of companies about splitting the stock 
“ whenever shares get over $3o and the company is doing well.” 
Anna Merjos, an assis­ tant vice president of 
Merrill Lynch. Pierce,

She says that when in­ st it Unions were buying 

 stork a few years ago. it didn’t seem to matter to the companies if the small investor was pur­ chasing their stock 
“ It was kind of a feather in their com­ pany’s cap that the insti­ tutions were buying their stock.” she says. “ But recently a lot of institu­ tions have been unload­ ing their stocks or alter­ ing their investment em­ phasis. This can have a severe effect on a stock

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday March 13 1977 
Gold fever infects investors 

By H.J. MAIDENBERG 
NEW Y O S * TIMES SERVICE 
NEW YORK - Gold fever has once again infected investors despite the strenuous efforts of government officials and pri­ vate bankers to fight the disease that consumes the paper money the central banks creat. 
Last week, the fever sent gold bul­ lion prices up $5 an ounce, to $143, the highest level in 14 months. Only last 
Labor Day the price was roughly $1o1 an ounce. 
“ There are two basic reasons to buy gold in peacetime,” one prominent dealer in precious metals declared last week. “ One is to try to make money, and the other is to protect one’s capital from the ravages of inflation.” 
Another gold dealer, at ,1. Aron & 
Co., suggested that inflation factors were the more powerful of the two. He pointed out: 
“ The rebound in gold prices from the $1oo level last Labor Day parallels the movement of the Commodity Re­ search Bureau’s index of commodity futures prices since then.” The index does not include gold among the 27 basic commodities measured. 
Another dealer observed that, “ the bandages of loans to the British pound. 

D ealers say the buyers are acquir­ ing the yellow m etal to protect their investments fro m the ravages o f infla­ tion 

Italian bra and lesser currencies will in time become unraveled, and the new monetary bandages will again add to inflation.” 
However, the gold specialists were as one in recalling the metal’s recent debacle. It began in late 1974, when 
Washington prepared to lift its ban on private ownership of gold bullion after more than four decades. 
When the ban was lifted on New 
Year’s Day 1975, gold bullion sold at a high of $198 an ounce. Despite the in­ flation that wracked the world most of that year, at the end of 1975 gold sold at today’s levels. 
Gold hoarders suffered a further setback last 
Ju n e, when the 
International Monetary Fund began selling its gold stockpile to aid third- world nations and, it was widely said, eliminate the golden thorn from the sides of monetarists. Bullion prices slumped to nearly $1oo. and investors swarmed out of the metal. 

Now that the gold fever is again endemic, the question facing investors or speculators is how to approach the metal — in shares in gold-mining companies, bullion, futures, numis­ matic coins and Kruggerands and other non-numismatic coins. 
SH A R E S : The consensus among gold specialists that stocks in gold- mining companies are among the safer ways to “ own” gold because they are not “ wasting assets.” Unlike futures, there is no fixed deadline before the investment may become worthless. 
They also offer the possibility of divi­ dends, unlike bullion or the other forms. 
The major problems with gold-min­ ing stocks is that many of the leading mining concerns are in South Africa and other places subject to political and social conditions that could un­ dermine share values. 

BU LLIO N : 
Ever since gold prices 
O ff p ea k pow er rating is tested 

By TERRY KIRKPATRICK 
AP BUSINESS WRITER 
Every day at 5 p.m. a small red light blinks on in David 
Smith’s dining room in Rutland, 
Vt., and his wife looks about for lights or appliances turned on but not in use. 
At the same time, an impulse sent by the power company through the elec­ tric lines triggers a switch out in the garage that turns off the fam ily’s water heater, dishwasher, freezer and clothes dryer. 
The Smiths are one of the first fa­ milies in the country to try a rapidly spreading concept in electricity rates called time-of-day pricing. It has al­ ready saved them money. 
Rates that go up and down with electricity demand during the day have been set up in the past year in a dozen states — most involve only a few customers —- and ordered by utility regulators in nine others. 
Interest in the rates might pick up this month. 
The results of a lengthy study by the industry are due and should give uti­ lities a better idea of the impact spe­ cific rate changes will have. 
One of the first companies to offer the rate regularly was Central Ver­ mont P u b lic Service Corp., the 
Smiths’, utility company, which hopes it will some day reduce the cost of producing electricity. 

Rates that go up and down with electricity d e - rn and- have saved money fo r users 

Utilities must be able to provide en­ ough electricity when demand is at its daily peak — such as in the evening when dinners are cooking and heaters are turned on. 
This generating capacity, however, sits idle at night, when thermostats are turned down, lights are off and dish­ washers are quiet. 
Usually, the extra electricity needed at peak times is produced in genera­ tors fired by expensive oil or gas. 
If enough customers shift their use to off-peak hours, the theory goes, less oil or gas will be required, and there might bt* less need of new generators in the future. 
To encourage this shift. Central 
Vermont sells electricity during peak hours — roughly 8-11 a m. and 5-9 p.m. 
— for al) 11.9 cents per kilowatt hour. 
In off-peak hours, the cost is only 1.9 cents per kilowatt hour. 
In off-peak hours customers on the old rate pay 5.5 cents all day. 
Only 18(1 customers have signed up for the rates since they were offered in 
Vermont on a regular basis a year ago. 

 so it is too early to determine whether the need for oil or new- generators will be reduced. 

But the impact on some customers has been dramatic. 

“ We are finding that the typical customer is probably going to save IO to 15 per cent of his annual electric bill,” says Tony Whitehair, research director for Vermont. 

“ Most of the customers are not changing their cooking and eating ha­ bits,” he said. As with the Smiths, their savings come from moving clothes and dish washing off-peak and turning off freezers and heaters. 

 floated upward from $35 an ounce, many investm ent advisors have 

 counseled their wealthier clients to put a portion of their assets into bullion, both as a long-term investment and as a hedge against inflation. 
To many gold dealers, bullion is still a “ big guy’s thing” for several reasons 
— it is not a particularly liquid asset, sellers must often pay assays to deter­ mine quality and some m arks, as brands are known, that were popular decades ago are often suspect today. 
Even quarter-ounce bars packaged in plastic may be suspect. After all. false gold has been around as long as the real thing. 
Thefts 
Storage, insurance and transport al­ so present problems with bullion. 
Many banks, for example, are happy to store gold, but they are not responsible for theft 
— as gold hoarders in 
France learned recently after safe-de- posit vaults in two large banks were looted. 
Some banks and other depositories tend to comingle bullion, which fre­ quently raises problems about marks, quality and color (gold comes in many colors). 
K RU G ERRA N D S AND RESTRU C K 
COINS: Many specialists interviewed hold that these coins are a convenient medium for small hoarders, but they caution against being gulled by dealers in fakes. 
The South African Krugerrand (one troy ounce) is the most popular of these bullion coins, but many inves­ tors also favor M exico’s restruck 
5o-peso piece (a bit more than 1.2 ounces), and coins in different sizes fashioned after coins that once were in common use in Austria and other countries. 

Popularity 
One reason for their popularity is that they are often sold to dealers for cash and can be bought from out-of- state dealers, thus saving the buyers a sales tax that would eat into potential profits. 
NUMISMATIC GOLD: This sector of the gold market has traditionally spun in its own orbit because the value of these coins depends in large part of their rarity, condition and popularity, as well as esthetic qualities. 
These factors in variab ly distort values. The very popular double ea­ gle, the once common $2o gold coin that contains almost an ounce of gold, was typically fetching nearly twice the price of bullion last week for pieces in fine condition and not too rare. 
Unlike the United States, Britain and 

 a number of other countries continued to mint sovereigns and other pieces long after they went off the gold stan­ dard because buyers worldwide are willing to pay sizable premiums for them because of their ingrained trust in gold. 

F U T U R E S : Gold dealers find fu­ tures extrem ely popular among short-term investors interested in high leverage. A standard 1oo-ounce futures contract can be bought for a margin — cash down payment — of 
$7oo to $1,ooo, depending on the credit of the buyer. That works out ton 

 roughly $1o an ounce. Sm aller con­ tracts are also available at corre­ sponding smaller margins. 
But there are two basic problems with futures. One is that every contract is valid for a specific time period. It cannot be put away in one’s hope chest and forgotten. 
The other is that futures trading is frequently volatile. Prices can swing widely enough to wipe out margins in minutes. And unless one stands by the phone ready to add cash to margins, brokers will often simply sell out posi­ tions, often wiping out a holding that was on the winning side. 

Spring planting 

GARDENERS are up in the air about Tuesday's opening of the 
73-story central tower of the $337 million Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit. These plants, 5o feet above the lobby, are weeping fig trees. 

WHY! 
HADTHE 

OFFICES 

 lity buildings and about 38 cents for the lower quality. 
Kyse says one of the stigmas facing downtown has been the lack of parking facilities. He says people have had misconceptions about the seriousness of the problem. 
“ Those renting office buildings on the Loop will tell people they don’t have bi pay for their parking spaces,” he says. 
“ True, you do have to pay for the 
{larking downtow n, but rental rates are substantially lower than those on the 
North Side,” he says. "Y o u ’re not 
{laying that much more for the com­ bination of parking and office space in the central business district.” 
Kyse says the office market in South 
Side will develop very little, showing only one major office complex, the 
Valley High complex, in the district. 

Healthy outlook 

The ttouth report showed a healthy outlook for the available for medical- dental office facilities. 
Occupancy figures for the Northwest and Northeast sections of the city had a combined total of 93 per cent, for 
453,8o1 square feet of leasable space 
But the Northwest area will need alsiut 49.ooo square feet of space within 

Continued from Page IG 

 the next year for medical-dental faci­ lities. It has only 37,831 square feet of vacancies currently — once again a shortage of facilities. 

M eanwhile, the medical-dental facilities downtown are 84 per cent oc­ cupied, with a total leasable area of 
433.559 square feet, according to the report. 

Two year supply 

The absorption rate is 35.ooo square feet leased during the past year, with vacancies running at 87,591 square feet, or a two-year supply. 
“ The market for the medical-dental facilities is healthy on the North Side, reasonably healthy in the downtown area, but not so healthy on the South and Southwest Sides,” he says. 
Kyse feels the report is an indicator of the overall economic condition of the city. 
“ For one thing, people will probably 

I m* surprised at the 2 1 per cent vacancy rate of the office spaces here,” he says. 
“ And at the fact the city has a 79 per cent occupancy of all its leasable space. This is better, we suspect, than what most {Hoople have thought." 
“ But, mainly, it shows how the city is growing.” says K>se.

 have either an outhouse or be connect cd to a sewage system. there because th a t's the only place they could afford.” County Com Al­ bert Bustamante says. 
County Judge Blair Reeves admits communities like Eastview Terrace are textbook examples of a slum, but he adds until counties receive ordin­ ance making authority they're power­ less to stop the conditions from reoc­ curring. 
Examples 

An application submitted to the fe­ deral government for community de­ velopment funds to pave Eastview 
Terrace’s streets declares that 
8(1 per cent of the community's housing is beyond repair and all the people living there are below the low and moderate income levels 
“ The reason it’s like thai is you can't establish building codes and since there s no zoning out there you have people living by pigs and it s a general mess.” Judge Reeves says. 
"A s far as the health conditions there, it’s fair to say anything goes in the county because we don't base any ordinances like they do in the city." says a spokesman for the Bexar County 
Metropolitan Health District. 
Another health problem in the area is caused by the lack of sewage faci­ lities. "The only thing we can do about the outhouses is to try to educate the people about flies There's no way we can make them do anything.” says the spokesman. 

E a stv ie w T e r r a c e began in 1957 when developer Aaron Mandell r e ­ ceived approval from Commissioners 
Court to plat the area, says Day. 
When Mandell applied to plat the 124 acres which comprise the subdivision, the county's only requirement was that he maintain the area's six roads for a year after receiving plat approval. 
County Judge Blair Reeves contends the blame for subdivision like E ast­ view T e r r a c e should rest with d e ­ velopers liecause they took advantage of the weak regulations. 
However. Mandell says he's fully complied with all of the county’a re­ gulations and h a s n ’t received any complaints from the county or the subdivision's residents. 
He admits though, it s been several years since either he or his employes have been to Eastview Terrace. 
' The only thing we had to do was keep up the roads for a year and we did that,” Mandell sax s. 
Big bill 
Regardless of where the blame for substandard developments lies, county officials agree on one point — ta x ­ payers are going to pick up a sizeable bill for their rejuvenation 
"I think it’s fair aking care ol the county's rural slums will easily run over $1 million." says Day. The m a ­ jority of the funds will come from fe­ deral sources. 
“ We receive an average of $25o.(MMI from the federal government in com­ munity development funds every year. 
And it looks like we ll be able to spend

The county has the same problem enforcing building codes as it does health standards in communities like 
Eastview T e r r a c e , says F e r n a n d o 
Cuellar of the county's public works department 

He adds that the county's zoning powers are nonexistent 

"Without zoning control you have agricultural conditions right in the m iddle of a r e sid e n tia l area and there's nothing we can do about it.’ he explains. 

Without building codes, residents living outside of the city limit are left on their own concerning how their houses are built. 

“ What happens is that you get these houses that are slapped together with­ out electricity or sewage.” Cuellar says.

Things went very wrong... 

By BEN KING JR. 

As the w arm er m onths ap ­ proach, Patsy Martinez, a far 
East Bexar County resident, says she’a scared her children will get sick again from m os­ quito bites. 
And no one can do anything about the situation. 
Pointing to a water-filled ditch near her home, the Eastview Terrace resi­ dent explains the ditch becom es a breeding site for mosquitoes during the warm months because no one sprays the area. 
"It's not so bad for the older children a n y m o r e , but my one-year-old daughter gets covered with hies and they really make her sick.” she ex­ plains in Spanish. 
Like most of the community's 75o residents, the dream of owning pro­ perty in the country and escaping city taxes has turned into a nightmare for 
Mrs. Martinez. 
Nightmare 
Instead of finding the peace and freedom usually associated with rural living, the community’s residents are faced with hog pens next to th e ir houses, impassable roads and mos­ quito swarms. 
And until the necessary state legis­ lation is passed, county officials say, they can’t do anything about the situa­ tion. 
They also admit they're powerless to stop sim ila r slum conditions from reoccurring elsewhere in the county. 
The p r o b le m ’s basis is Eastview 
T e rra c e and sim ila r Bexar County communities are situated in a juris­ dictional no-man’s land where the city and county have only limited powers. 
Since neither governmental entity his ordinance making or zoning powers in that area, a hodgepodge of problems exist concerning health standards and detiorating living conditions. 
Currently, county officials are con- tinueing their 1o-year-old fight to get the state legislature to extend their powers into a r e a s like E astv iew 
Terrace. 
In the meantime though, the price tag for r e ju v e n a ti n g the c o u n t y ’s slum s is rising past the $1 million m ark in tax dollars And their resi­ dents continue to suffer. 
Mrs. Martinez says mosquitoes are only part of her problems. Iii fact, she says, she’s amazed her children don’t get sick more often, since their play area is bounded by a neighbor’s hog pen. 
She also says she has to constantly remind them not to play in the trash 
Life after death? It’s eerie but plausible

M OODY JR 

Let me say al tile very beginning that I ani not trying to prove that there is life after death. Nor do I think that a 
“ proof’* of this is presently possible. 

What is it like lo die? 
That is a question which humanity has been asking itself e \ e r since there have been humans, 
We are faced with two contrasting answers to our original question alnnit the nature of lieut Ii, both of ancient d e n s a- lion. yet both widely held even today. Some sa.v that death is annihilation of consciousness; others say with equal confidence that death is the passage of the soul or mind into a n o th e r d im e n sio n of reality. 
In what follows I do not wish in an.v way to dis­ m iss e ith e r a n sw e r 
I simply wish to give a re­ tort on a search which I have personally underta­ ken 
The experiences which 
I have studied fall into three distinct categories 
( I i The experiences ol persons w h o w e re r e s u s ­ cita ted after hav m g been t h o u g h t , a d j u d g e d , o r p r o n o u n c e d cl in ic ally dead by their d o cto rs,

First iii a series 

One of mankind's must constant preoccupations since the beginning of time h as been the finality of life. Religionists preach of a lite hereafter but no mortal has returned trom death with incontrovertible evidence that there is one. 

Raymond A. Moody Jr., M D., a professor of philosophy who went on lo leach medicine and philosophy in a medical school, has conducted unique research into the possibility of survival alter physical death. 

The result Is a best-selling hook oi true experiences of p erson s declared clinically dead who "came back” to relate descriptions so vividly similar they provide a strong case tor changing accepted views of lite, death and the hereafter. 

This is Ole first of five excerpts from the book in which the author discusses what it is like to die. 

( ll The experiences «*l p ersons who. as they died, told them to other people who were present latter, these other people reported the content of the death experience to me 
Let me now const met a brief, theoretically ideal or complete experience which embodies all of the common elements, rn the order in which it is typi­ cal for them to occur. 
Noise 

A man is dying and, as he reaches the point of g r e a te s t physical d i s ­ tress. he hears himself pronounced dead by his doctor lh* I»egms to hear an uncomfortable noise, a loud ringing or buzz­ ing. and at the same time levis h im self moving very rapidly through a tong dark tunnel

I iuds himself outside of his own physical body,

Bv ROBERT HEARD 
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AUSTIN — In the confusion of 
House debate under pressure of time or subject, a bulldog of a man sits calmly beside the po­ dium feeding the speaker the words that make a bill live or die. 
Parliam entarian Bob Johnson, 48, was a firebrand conservative re p re ­ sentative from Dallae in the late 195os and early 19Bos. 
Today, he enjoys the respect of li­ berals and conservatives. And it’s not because he guards his tongue like some neutered demi-god. Even on hot political questions, Johnson answers quick and straight. 
Straight 
H e’ll tell a re p re se n ta tiv e what chances he thinks a bill has of passage. 
He’ll say who he thinks is ahead in a race for speaker, and betting right on that question is crucial to important committee assignments. 
Johnson has been executive director of the Legislative Council since late 
1963. Being House p arliam en tarian goes with that job. 
One of the most important jobs of his office is to be su re laws are not amended or abolished through some technical error. 
For example, such an error could repeal the law against m urder, and during the time the repeal is effective and the time the legislature passed a new- murder statute, a murderer could be charged only with assault. 
“ I live in constant fear something like th a t’ll happen, and it's gonna happen someday . “ he says 
Volume 

The volume of legislation and the restriction of 149 days for legislative business every two years creates this danger, he says. That’s why he has six people that do nothing bul read bills looking for such errors. 
He said the representatives “ lean on me all the time.” particularly on the m a tte r of d ra ftin g th e ir bills in a hurry. This is one of the areas where a me rn lier is at the mercy of Johnson s decision 
“They’ll say, ‘I’ve got a press con­ ference next Monday,'” he said “ So we try to accommodate them on so­ mething Uke that.” 
That puts the bill ahead of others, and that draw s arrow s from those forced to wait longer. 
But it’s his parliamentarian role that makes him a star. 
Several times each session, usually in the final weeks. Johnson makes a ru lin g that in effect kills a bill. 
Sometimes the parliamentary question is close, and he admits a prejudiced person sitting in that chair could abuse the p i^ e r and still give a logical ex­ planation for the ruling 

Failed 

Once, a controversial hill failed to win enough support in committee even for a minority report The rules say it takes a two-thirds vote on the floor of the House to bring up such a bill for debate. 
Som etim es, when the problem is really knotty, Johnson and the speaker retire to the speaker's office for as long as 45 minutes, then emerge with a de­ cision on a point of order. 
They need that much time, Johnson says, to read the legislation closely and to consult two multi-volume collections of congressional precedents 
Jo h n so n often has to “ bite my tongue” when representatives violate the rules, lf nobody notices and ob­ jects, Johnson cannot make a ruling 
Each session, there are perhaps 5o major pieces of legislation that every­ body knows about. It s the other 3,ooo bills that worry Johnson, because only a few supporters or opjionents — and 
Johnson — know what those bills con­ tain 
One headache he no longer has is memorial resolutions The House used 

 to grind out hundreds of those each session. 
One representative from San Antonio used to come into Johnson’s office each 
Monday morning with the obituary co­ lumn from a San Antonio newspaper. 
He ordered a legislative memorial re­ solution for each name. 
It sounds like a good political idea. 
The d ecease’s relatives presum ably would be grateful. But that represen­ tative was defeated. 
Johnson quotes the late Sen. Red 
Berry of San Antonio as saying of that practice, “ It just proves dead folks don’t vote in San Antonio." 
Frequently, the speaker has to talk with someone behind the podium, and 
Johnson must feed him, sentence by sentence, a ruling on a point of order that the speaker is ignorant about. 
The speaker says a couple of sen­ tences, then pauses to listen to John­ son. 
Some lean on him more than others. 
One of those was Gus Mutscher. John­ son came to be known as “ Mutscher s ventriloquist.”

Oil doth not a sheik make 

Linda Blandford climbed into the walled gardens of Arabia to learn what life is like for the men and w om en w hose liv e s have been changed by oil wealth. Her new book. “ $uper-Wealth: The Secret 
Lives of the Oil Sheiks,” tells part of that story. 

By LINDA BLANDFORD 
I'm in a country that you’ll never find in a holiday brochure. 
They don’t allow tourists any­ where near it. 
I’m in Saudi Arabia, the richest oil kingdom in the world, a vast desert land with salt water on two sides but none (or next to none) to drink. 
It's choking on its oil wealth, and its crazy m adness has the sam e compul­ sive attraction and intensity as Hol­ lywood in the 193o's. Like Hollywood then, it has nothing to do with w h at­ ever else is going on in the world. 
Where did it all start? A few years ago. say IO, hardly anyone had even heard of Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz except a h a n d fu l of s c h o l a r s , d i p l o m a t s , or b a n k e r s , m a y b e . But in 1974 T i m e m a g az in e ran a cover story on this man who ruled Saudi Arabia with the power of an a b s o lu te m o n a r c h and named him its “ Man of the Y ear.” 
Three months later he was shot dead by his own n e p h e w , a 3o-year-old ex-University-of-California-at-Berkeley s t u d e n t p r i n c e w ho h ad his h ea d chopped off publicly by way of reward. 
Diplomats feared a Socialist revolu­ tion, another oil em b a rg o (like 1973) with gas stations in the States running dry again. It was false alarm , but the shivers of fear m anaged to cross half the world to us here. 
It was about this tim e that people started to notice an influx of strange men in long white sheets descending into low limousines around Lexington 
Avenue after a rush through their fa­ v o r ite 
New 
Y o rk s t o r e . 
Bloo- mingdale’s. 
Arab fever hit the U.S.. and as Beir­ ut crum bled in the su m m e r of '75 more and more white-sheeted sheiks moved over to the West for their months of s u m m e r vacation. 

If one had to pinpoint a mo­ ment when New Yorkers woke up to this phenomenon, it was the day that some extraordinary news leaked from the Olympic 
Tower. 

Saudi Arabian multi-millionaire Ad­ min K h a s h o g g i , well know n in the a r m s - b u y i n g t r a d e a n d to congressional hearings for his g ia n t­ sized commissions from Lockheed and 
Northrop, had bought the a p a rtm en t below his new m u l t i m i l l i o n - d o l l a r apartm ent — to catch any drips from his glass-sided sw im m in g pool under construction? lf one had to do the sam e for London. it was the day when airing m attresses a p p e a r e d over th e win dow sills of a 
$75o,ooo m a n s i o n o p p o s i t e t h a t of 
Douglas F airbanks Jr.. and next door to an outraged Conservative M em ber of P a r l i a m e n t . T he fam ily of Sheik 
Zayed of Abu Dhabi had moved in. 
T h at s u m m e r of ‘75 a n y o n e who hailed from an oil-producing country in the Mideast automatically becam e a 
"sheik.” That at least was one word we could latch onto. Arabs have peculiar, u n p ro n o u n ceab le n a m e s p u n c tu ate d with ibn and a1 and all very confusing. 
Sheik was snappier; m anservants of rich Arabs spotted on 57th Street were 
" s h e i k s . ” I ra n a ia n s w ere " s h e i k s . ” 
And s h e i k s m e a n t s p e n d i n g , d i a ­ monds. " m e n in pim pm obiles.” as one 
American businessman very thick with 
Arabs put it. 
T hey c a m e from c o u n trie s hardly anyone had even heard of. Saudi Ara­ bia, yes. But Qatar? In fact, they ca m e from very few cou n tries indeed, a handful of countries with two basic things in common: they're the seven with almost feudal autocratic rulers, plus so much wealth and so few people that th e y h a v e l a r g e p e t r o d o l l a r surpluses. 
We're talking about Saudi Arabia, 
Bahrain (the first to bring in oil, the first to be running out), Kuwait. Qatar, and three sheikdoms from a part of the world that was once known as the P i r ­ ate Coast and is now more respectably titled the F e d e r a t i o n of th e U nited 
Arab E m ira t e s — Abu Dhabi. Dubai and Sharjah. 
Another country helps — Oman. Alas for the ruler of Oman, lie's had Com­ m u n i s t g u e r r i l l a s t h r e a t e n i n g his peace and not enough oil to m ake many of his subjects rich. So Oman doesn’t count, but bear it in mind. 
Iranians a r e n ’t oil sheiks. Iranians are n ’t even Arab. They’re Muslim, but they couldn't be more different from the peoples of the Seven iii the massive peninsula facing them across the Gulf 
(to the Arabs i f s the Arabian Gulf; to the Iranians it s the Persian Gulf). 
Persians, or Iranians as they're now called, have a wholly different culture. 
Most of the really choice Mideast sales through d eale rs like Sotheby Parke- 
H e m e t over the past six yea rs have been to Iranians. 
So Iranians aren’t sheiks. Now for the next killer. Most of the Arabs in the 
M a g n i f i c e n t S ev en a r e n ’t s h e i k s either. In Saudi Arabia sheik is a spe­ cial title (it means “ old m a n " ) given to honor a distinguished m an or the head of a la rge family, i t ’s nothing much; anyone from the royal family is his Highness the prince 
In the other six countries all royals and only royals are sheiks (and let s face it. w e ’re not talking about the 
Homanoffs or H a p s b u r g s , we're talk­ ing about m e m b e rs of a “ loyal” family that happens to rule a few thousand people on some valuable real estate, that's all). 
T h e r e s t a r e c o m m o n e r s , a l b e i t mostly plain common rich But to the 
West all oil Arabs are oil sheiks, a new breed that se e m s to be overrunning our world and buying up a big chunk of it. 
I wanted to clam ber into the walled 

 rich Saudi women are adding the Pill to their shopping lists for their trips abroad. 

Riyadh, bang in the geographical m iddle of this barren, em pty, frightening country, is Saudi Arabia's Wa­ shington — the center of g o ­ vernment and growing every day. Now forget that comparison because Riyadh is tension-char- coaled daily under the desert sun. Nothing is predictable. The place only looks like a modern city, more correctly a modern building site. 

THE SHEIKS OF OLD have this kind of heritage mosques and palaces in the poshest of settings 

 g ardens of Arabia and find out what life feels like to the men and. particu­ larly, the women who are trying to get bv on those oil millions. I don't know w hat I ex p ected to find — R udolph 
Valentino, tents, harem s, erotic m y s ­ teries lived out in settings that Cecil B.

And just in case you’ve missed the point of how ra rely you can see the point — King Faisal called his father

Some bankers and most Sau­ dis will tell you that Saudi Ara­ bia is really wised up about money. Not yet it isn t — it wants to be, but it s still too much of a child determined to have all the toys the adults have and be able to afford them 
Saudi Arabia envies W estern te ch­ nology and it wants it all — fast, good, bad, or indifferent. So millions of dol­ l a rs w o r t h of c o n t r a c t s a r e up for grabs, and every huckster and busin­ e s s m a n in th e world w h o ’s c h a s in g money passes through Riyadh at some time right now

The hotel lobbies (such few as exist) throng with businessmen, nerves and expense accounts stretched to b re a k ­ ing point, baffled by this entirely alien culture.

All of this leaves Walter Faulds, with his rap id ly g r a y i n g h a i r and su e d e shoes, waiting with pained resignation for Prince Faisal ibn Fahd. The young prince, son of the Crown Prince, pos­ sesses (in his capacity as director of youth welfare) the crucial signature 
Faulds needs on his contract. 
The whereabouts of Prince Faisal is a m y s t e r y . His office s a y s he isn t there now 
He might be there tom or­ row. But Bukra, in s h a a ’Allah (tomor­ row, God w illi n g ) is a w ell-know n passw ord. God might not be willing tomorrow. He very often i s n ’t. And 
Prince Faisal's office staff have been saying that for the last three weeks. 
Faulds waits, along with all the lobby captives. 
Everyone’s terrified of quitting the hotel i i i case That Call comes. Around one table near Faulds huddles a group pushing bulletproof Cadillacs. At a n ­ other there’s an Egyptian psychiatrist p l a y i n g a n x i o u s l y w ith h is w o r r y beads, lie s here to set up a psychiatric unit at the $2oo-million (that's only the check for the first stage) King Faisal

But has it? Follow that man home, out of the public eye. and you find a n ­ other Riyadh. The black oil sp urting from underground is not as simple a blessing as the biblical m a n n a floating down from heaven. Behind tho high walls of Saudi h o m e s th e re a re c a ­ sualties. That m a n ’s wife is one. 
She sits in her living room, hooked on cigarettes and tranquilizers. She's in her late 2o’s, s h rin k in g , w astin g away, her face pale and pasty . Her long slender legs hang listlessly below h e r sh o rt P a r i s c o u t u r e s k i r t a n d skinny T-shirt. 
In some ways life was easier for her mother. There were slaves then (sla­ very was abolished officially only in 
1982). but a wife still had work No 
C’alifornia-style kitchens a generation ago, no air conditioning, no schooling abroad or glim pses of an alternative life to th e p r i s o n of t h e w o m e n ’s qua rters. 
The d au g h t e r has lost and gained some progress. Several times a week she co vers her face with a m a s k of makeup, slides into long gowns, m e ­ chanic ally a r r a n g e s th e jewels th at bible h e r th e p o s s e s s i o n of a m ultim illionaire — and she and her husband go out together; th a t’s avant garde for Riyadh. They go out to sit within the four walls of friends. Walls can be a haven: they can feel like a coffin. 

Petro-women are suffocated both by the 
J customs of a time past and the image given their status in life 

“ My fa th e r a r r a n g e d our marriage when I was 16,” she says. “ I rem em ber our honey­ moon, sitting on the plane with this stranger and I didn’t know how to begin talking to him. I didn’t know the first thing about contraception, so I had four children in four years. How could I take care of a child? 
“ I was a child myself. 
"Now I’ve grown up. I’m not a child any longer, but he won’t see that You think I d o n ’t know that m y husband s u ffe rs too? I ’ve s t r e t c h e d out and longed for him to see that I’m not the stupid child he m a rrie d , plat he can trust me, confide in me, let m e share some of his worries. He doesn’t want m e to grow up. 
"I went to a European boarding school with normal girls. Do you know- how hard it has been for me to adjust? 
Women c a n ’t d rive here , so I c a n ’t leave the house without a driver for the car. When I do go out I have to put on a long black cloak and cover my face. I suffocate. I know other women say it ll d is a p p e a r one day. But w hat ab o u t now? I f s now that the viel suffocates me, now that I a m hum iliated.” 

I understand only too well. 
One weekend I’m invited away by another family. With great embarrassment they ask if I d mind covering my lace. lf I were fair, everyone would recognize me as a European. Because I'm dark, they fear people who know their family will take me for an 
Arab — an unveiled Arab wo­ man would dishonor them in the eves of others. 

It is an eerie experience — all the eerier for tin* fact that, though they don’t know it. I’m actually Jewish I do suffocate, but w h at’s worse is the way that I don’t exist to the people around me who see the black anonymity of a person who i s n ’t th e re b ec au s e she can’t be seen 
How can this woman s husband be­ gin to understand this humiliation? Or see that he lets her out of the country to 

 a freedom she c a n ’t handle and then brings her back to a constriction she c a n ’t bear. 
“ Here I rule my house, th a t’s all. I decide what food m u st be cooked w hen he telephones at noon from the office to sav h e 's b r i n g i n g in m e n h o m e for lunch. I a r r a n g e for the m e a l to be served while I disappear through a n ­ other door in the kitchen so that no man can see m e . ” 
“ Has time really brought more freedom? It’s brought the freedom of tickets to E u ro p e or the States. If I want to go away I only have to ask. And what do I do there? I go shopping, sit in a hotel room and d a r e n ’t go out b e ­ cause there’s always some Riyadh who might see me and tell his family. 
" H e ’s unfaithful. There isn’t a hus­ band in Saudi A ra b ia who isn t u n ­ faithful. Not h e r e , of c o u r s e ; h e r e they're angels. And hypocrites. I mind, but what can I do about it? We don't d iscuss it b ec au s e we d o n ’t d i s c u s s anything that matters. 
“ Every now and again I s c re am at him and believe me, I have a tongue like a serpent. I know it. He wouldn't hit me. He couldn’t. To do that would be to admit that I’m another adult hu­ man being, not a child.” 

This woman isn’t unusual, but 
I can’t name her. To make her unhappiness public or that of other women who talk openly to me would dishonor the family. 
That’s the real crime; a family’s honor is its life raft in this so­ ciety. So this depressed woman sits at home and everyone ar­ ound her pays the price for her confusion. Her husband is, as she says herself, a good man. 

"I love that woman. 
My father showed me m an y photographs of sui­ table girls when it was time for m e to get married, but I chose her myself — 
I wanted her. And now she can hurt m e m ore than anyone. But w hat do you want me to do? I give her jewels, she shrugs. 
"I give her thousands to buy clothes from London and New York. She com ­ plains because she c a n ’t wear them in 
Riyadh except at home ‘Then why buy short skirts ’’ I ask Why m u s t she re­ mind herself every day of w hat she can’t do? 
“ I work all day and it. isn’t easy. It’s one decision after another and govern­ ment life is one long fight Must I fight at home every night? She says I don’t talk to her. W hen am I supposed to talk to her? It s part of our way of life to have an open house with friends walk­ ing in at any time. 
“ I ca n ’t lock our door against them to make time to talk to her. And I don’t want to. What else is there that m a t ­ ters in life hut your friends and your family? 
“ I don’t believe in her covering here face but I wouldn’t bring s h a m e on my family by letting her be seen unveiled in daylight. But at night, if we’re going by ear to friends, I don’t even ask that of her. I just ask her to put on h er cloak and a thin chiffon scarf over her hair. 
" D o n ’t women wear headscarves in your country? Is that a terrible sac­ rifice? Ten years ago I couldn’t have driven with her sitting beside m e in the e a r . let alone without a veil. I couldn’t have let her go to Europe for the su m m e r to get away from the heat. 
Why won i she see how th in g s have changed for the better'’ 
" W o rk '’ Of course she c a n ’t work. 
W hy should she need to'' We don’t need the money and our families wouldn’t like it. Sometimes I think it was better in the past ” At this m om ent his face looks like that of a sad old man. and lie s only in his e a rly 3D’s. “ Life is getting too complicated. Urn afraid of what’s happening to all of u s.” 
One of his f r i e n d s is b u i l d i n g a 
$3-mi!lion villa in Riyadh. Every wee­ kend the friend goes out to inspect his site. It will have soft beige terrazzo floors, many courtyards, a sw im m ing pool, a " b a c h e l o r ” room d o w nstairs for his pals, a boudoir to take morning coffee with his wife. There are hidden g a r d e n s an d w a t e r f a l l s g l i m p s e d through the windows. 
This will be th a t oth er m a n ’s first h o m e of his own. lh* a n d his wife sta rted in a la rge family com p o u n d with all his brothers and cousins and their families, a place te e m in g with people and protective w a r m t h . Now th e y s h a r e a h o u s e w i t h j u s t o n e brother’s family. The next step is the house on the hill — one man, one wife, th ree c h i ld ren . T h is e m p t y m a r b l e house will seem like a mausoleum to him.

Coastal lands plan needed 

Hearings this week on pro­ posed a Coastal M anagement 
Program will outline details of long-range outlook for the Texas 
Gulf coast. 

Those details were developed during a series of hearings by a com prehensive com m ittee of 
Texans. In 15 workshops and other session s, Texans d e­ scribed goals for management of “the most productive acres in our state.” 

Bills designed to put those goals into law have been offered in the Senate by Sen. A. R. 
Schwartz of Galveston and Rep. 
Pike Powers of Beaumont. 

San Antonio and South Texas have obvious interests in coastal m anagem ent for recreation, commercial enterprise and the invaluable preservation of renewable resources. 

Land C om m issioner 
Bob 
Armstrong has pointed out that oil and gas production from the coastal lands produced 1976 re­ venues in excess of $18o million. 
But, he said, they also produced 
$117 million worth of shrimp and one-third of Texas tourism's $7.5 billion. 

Further, from 197o to 1975 while Texas population in­ creased by 9 per cent, the Hous­ ton area grew by 15 per cent, the Rio Grande Valley grew by 
2o.6 per cent and Fort Bend 

C ounty (Richmond, Rosenberg) grew by 43 per cent. The trend remains. 

The coastal lands are impor­ tant to many varied interests. 
Phe proposed management pro­ gram offers an approach to compatible sharing of those in­ terests on constructive lines. 

It is a how-to growth design. 
It seeks coordination among the 
Land Office, Railroad Commis­ sion, Water Development Board, 
Water Quality Board and the 
Parks and Wildlife Commission. 

The problems have been stu­ died copiously. Armstrong said the state has spent $12o million in the past IO years studying the coast, and m ost of the plans were uncoordinated and “ are on som eon e’s shelf gathering dust.” 

Getting the program into law may be difficult but it shouldn’t be delayed. Studies made in de­ veloping the plan show need for accom m odating legitim ate in­ terests without abusing other legitimate interests and that is a proper public policy. 

Coastal lands are largely owned by the state already, but their management is too frag­ mented and haphazard for the areas long to survive. 

The legislature should adopt the Schwartz-Power bills in this session. 
School trustees should ease tax load 

The trustees of San Antonio 
Independent School District held to their plan and raised the district’s tax rate by 26 per cent last week. 

The 3o-cent increase from 
$1.52 to $1.82 had been delayed until after last month’s unsuc­ cessful bond election. Prior to the election, district plans called for an additional rate increase next year to $2.1o per $1oo va­ luation on property. 

The rate increase will add an additional $4 m illion to re­ venues. Added values on the tax rolls this year over last year in­ creased revenues by approxi­ mately 8 per cent. 

The district will benefit ad­ ditionally from the state’s fund­ ing program if the formula re­ mains even approximately as it is proposed in Austin. Those funds will be for next year, however. 

But funding plans should

 start now . 

We believe a part of the plan should be to raise the homestead exemption of those householders over age 65 years from $3,ooo to 
$5,ooo. The $3,ooo figure has been in force for generations and the legislature has made higher exemptions optional for the various taxing districts of the state. Nearly every other district has raised the exem p­ tion to at least $5,ooo. 

The district could raise the exemption to $5,ooo for a total drop in revenues of onlv 
$4oo,ooo. 

Since the San Antonio district encom p asses the center city and. therefore, a large share of the low-income families and the older residences, there is scar­ cely an area of the city where the increased exemption would be more justified. We really cannot understand the trustees’ reluctance to grant the added tax relief in view of both higher values and a higher tax rate.

The thought of spending tax dollars for ballet shoes and pir­ ouettes makes some people want to do their own sort of dance routine — usually jumping up and down and shouting. 

But that s exactly what the San An­ tonio Ballet C om pany is asking City 
Council to do — spend $9o,ooo to ex­ pand the com pany’s si/e and lengthen its perform ing season. 
T h e s tr o n g r e a c tio n th e r e q u e s t might get from some citizens isn’t be­ cause they believe the dancers don't deserve the funds. 
The question the ballet com pany is ra is in g for the second y e a r is how much the public benefits from financ­ ing the arts. 
Or how do you tell a man standing knee-deep in flood w aters that seeing som eone ju m p around in tights will m ake him feel as good as a drainage p r o je c t b e in g fu n d e d for his neighborhood? 
T ra d itio n ally , the a v e ra g e citizen never had to w orry about financing projects like the symphony, the ballet and m useum s. As far as the public was concerned, that was som ething little old ladies in m ink coats would take care of with generous donations. 

Inflation 

But with inflation the price of ballet shoes and d an cers’ salaries continued to rise with everything else. And while the p h ila n th r o p ic a l d o n a tio n s k e p t com ing in. they w eren’t enough to plug the a r ts ’ financial drain. 
W ith in a few y e a r s m a jo r s y m ­ phonies and b a lle t c o m p a n ie s w ere facin g d is a s te r and the c h a n c e for cities w ithout co m p an ies to develop them seem ed microscopic. 
The only hope cam e from the federal governm ent, which m ade several m il­ lion dollars available to com m unities to be spent on a wide range of projects.

The trick is the projects have to be approved by a c o m m u n ity 's elected officials, which in San Antonio’s case m eans its City Council. 
The ballet com pany won its initial fu n d in g b a ttle la st y e a r w h en th e council approved a $5o,ooo g ra n t to sustain the com pany for another sea­ son. 
Along with the season cam e six pro­ fessional dancers who do nothing but dance. 
Until recently the com pany had been composed mostly of dancers who had to have other jobs to supplem ent their income because the com pany had in­ sufficient funds. 
But now the $5o,ooo the com pany re­ ceived has dwindled and it's asking for 
$9o,ooo in fe d e ra l re v e n u e s h a rin g funds to becom e a fully professional co m p a n y w ith 12 d a n c e r s arid a business m anager. 
T h e re a re se v eral citizen s g ro u p s w ho've tak en the stan d that all the culture in the world isn t going to help the city if m any of its citizens’ homes got flooded every tim e there s a sizea­ ble rain. 

B ut the ballet co m p an y h as a r g u ­ ments which show a professional com ­ pany can be both spiritually and econ­ omically uplifting for a com m unity. 
For a city like San Antonio, which is alw ays try in g to a ttra c t m a jo r co m ­ panies. professional ballet is alm ost a p re re q u is ite , say s Nancy Sm ith, the local com pany’s assistant director. 

“ When a m ajor business is choosing where it’s going to locate, it naturally looks at the d iffe ren ce betw een the cities where its executives m ight live,” she says. 
“ W hether you like it or not one of the differences is what the cities have to offer in areas like the symphony and ballet,” she adds. 
B e s id e s th e p o te n tia l e c o n o m ic benefits professional ballet can bring, 
Miss Smith says, there is the fact bal­ let is no longer an art form that r e ­ quires w ealth on the p a rt of the a u ­ dience before a p erfo rm an ce can be truly appreciated. 
12 million 
Last year 12 million people through­ out the nation attended ballet perfor­ mances and obviously they w eren't all m em b ers of the m ink and diam onds set. 
And in San Antonio the local co m ­ pany m akes sure the entire com m unity has a chance to enjoy ballet by p re ­ s e n tin g s e v e r a l fre e p r o g r a m s in shopping m alls and schools. 
W ithe every free p e rfo rm an ce the com pany w ins new fans and tak es a step clo ser to ev e n tu a lly b eing s u p ­ ported mainly from ticket sales. 
W hen council s ta r t s to w eigh the im p o rta n c e of s p e n d in g its fe d e ra l do llars, it needs to co n sid er exactly how m uch the $9o.(HH) will buy. 
T he funds will finance only about one-tenth of the average neighborhood drainage project, if that much. 
But the sam e am ount of money in­ vested in the beginnings of a profes­ sional ballet com pany could result in som ething the entire com m unity could enjoy. 
M aybe the ballet would act as so­ m e th in g of a c a ta ly s t, b r in g m o re people and m ore business to the city. 
T hat would m ean a bigger tax base. w hich would ev en tu a lly m ean m o re money for. yes, drainage projects. 
Sun Antonio could have its cake and eat it too.

Pyndus praise 

Sir. Kem per Diehl says Republicans are supporting Nielsen because Phil 
Pyndus was a Rcaganite. B alderdash: 
I was a congressional district coordin­ ator for the President Ford Com m ittee and a Ford delegate candidate in the prim ary, but Phil Pyndus has m y full support for re-election and he is the 
ONLY m em b er of the present City 
Council who m erits my full support. 
I will be the first to state that Mr. 
Pyndus doesn’t pick p resid e n ts too well. but he is not running for presi­ dent. He is running for City Council and intra-party presidential politics has nothing to do with the issues facing the City of San Antonio. 
Mr. Pyndus has obviously done a good job of protecting the com m on good of the people of San Antonio because just about every selfish sp e­ cial interest group in town is opposing him . O ver the last two y e a rs Dr. 
Nielsen has been one of the most ineffective, do-nothing councilm an I've seen in a long tim e. and. prior to the adoption of fairly conservative District 
8. traditional liberalism has been indi­ genous to his voting record. 
There is absolutely no reason for any 
Ford supporter to support Nielsen and 
I am confident that all of m y friends from the Ford who cam paign who live in District 8 will run, not walk, to the 
Pyndus head q u arters. It is not the future of the Republican party that is at stake; it is the future of our city that is at stake.

Henry B .’s free o f that m eatgrinder 

Alam o 

Sir; In reference to S ecre tary of 
State M ark White s speech (M arch 7. 
San Antonio Express) com m em orating the 141st anniversary of the battle at the Alamo, I feel compelled to point out inaccuracies of his speech. 
His version of the battle has alway existed because few people have ever spoken for General Santa Anna. This history has been distorted since the fall of the Alamo. 
White asserts that the Alamo heroes fought for “ lib erty and fre e d o m ’’. 
T ejas. as it w'as known th en , w as actually a part of Mexico and the m en at the Alamo had no business fighting for “ freedom ” in a foreign country. 
As far as liberty goes, the settlers bought m ore than 2,ooo slaves to Tejas and 
Mexico, like most progressive nations, had abolished slavery since 
1829. Mexico was against the introduc­ tion of slavery to its country. Mexico had allowed settlers in Tejas, but with the s tip u la tio n th a t no s la v e s be brought to the country and that all settlers be of the Catholic religion. 
These restrictions w ere being ignored by the settlers who num bered m ore than 2o.ooo by 183o 
Unknown to m ost people is the fact that Santa Anna did not have 5,ooo men, but 2.1(H) who were ill equiped with seven cannon unm atched to the 
A lam o’s 21. F u rth e rm o re, Santa An­ na’s men were sick with the flu and out in the open, while the m en at the 
Alamo were hidden behind thick rock walls. 
The Alamo heroes were not patriots. 
I recom m end to everyone interested in learning accurate history to read 
Walter Lord’s “ Myths and Realities of the A lam o.” T here has been m uch distortion and Lord s article sets the record straight.

There was not a hint for Star readers that H arlan was realty a Republican politician, twice defeated as a candi­ date for Congress and most recently a high-level briefcase-toter for the GOP adm inistration. -

 him no sincere support 

Iii fact, W right allowed him self to quip glibly about forcing a “ shotgun m a rria g e ” of Gonzalez and Sprague — thus equating a com m ittee ch airm an wit Ii a Congressional employe. 
The wreckage of the com m ittee has also been attributed by some insiders to “ m align neglect” by O ’Neill.

“ They never stopped to see if there was a good reason for H enry’s action,” noted one Washington veteran. "Then they found them selves out on a limb and couldn’t adm it it "

Missile competition continues 

By C. RO BER T ZELNICK 
WASHINGTON po s t 
WASHINGTON - Those who saw in the SALT I agreements concluded between the United 
States and the Soviet Union in 
May, 1972, the beginning of the encl of strategic competition between the two countries have to date been proven anything but prophetic. 

Anti-ballistic missile system s were su bstantia lly banned by treaty . And tile Interim SALT Agreement, as m o­ dified by the 1974 Vladivostok accord, placed limits on the num ber of offen­ sive missile launchers each side could deploy. But within these constraints, 
SALT I has merely served to intensify the co m p e ti tio n for q u a l i t a t i v e i m ­ provements in nuclear weapons tech­ nology. 
Size, power and accuracy have thus far been the hallm arks of that com pe­ tition. Now a developing U.S. weapon, the M-X, while co m b in in g all those strate g ic virtues, p ro m is e s to intro- msmmm \ 

 duce a new element into the intercon­ tinental missile game: land-based mo­ bility. 
At his first news conference as P re ­ sident, J i m m y C arter invited the So­ viet Union to join the United States in a m utua l ban on m obile m issile s. “ If they would agree to a cessation of the 

 creasing the n u m b e r of w arheads or re-entry vehicles (RVs) which can be independently ta rg e ted , or MIRVed, from a single missile land launcher.

 use or deployment of the mobile type missiles w hich could be moved around in different locations before launch,” the President said, “ that would be a very i m p o r ta n t point for us to join them in a mutual agreement. It would mean we would not then perhaps spend the large amounts of money to develop a mobile missile. 
Cut 
As if to provide an earnest endorse­ m en t of th e P r e s i d e n t ' s p ro p o s a ls . 
Defense S ecretary Harold Brown a n ­ nounced a cut of som e $ I BO million from the $294.4 million requested by 
President Ford this year for work on the M-X M issle — now in its final stages of research and development — suggesting that the right kind of SALT 
Agreement could obliviate the need for production of the M-X altogether. 
But there may have been less to the 
Administration's action than met the eye. 
For one thing, in his yen to increase e x p e n d i t u r e s for s t r a t e g i c s y s t e m s across the board. President F ord had accelerated the scheduled 1984 deploy­ m ent of the M-X by a full y ea r and would h a v e h a d p r o d u c t i o n on th e weapon begin in 
October. 
1977. even while several questions relating to the basing of the system remained unresolved. The slower development pace d ic tated by B row n th u s m a d e sense quite apart from any SALT im ­ plications. 

Second, as the so-called “ next gen­ eration" of U.S. intercontinental bal­ lis tic m i s s i l e s ( I ( 'B M s ) , t h e M-X decision raises enormous policy ques­ tions which an administration barely in office has had little time to consider, let alone resolve. 
Whether or not to produce an M-X and what to demand from the Soviets in exchange for not producing it are decisions about which military strate­ gists, a rm s controllers and foreign po­ licy officials — not to m e n tio n the 
Congress — will all w ant to have a voice. And to date there has been little institutional consideration of the issue within the Carter administration itself or between it and the powers on Capitol 
Hill. 
Opinion 

Indeed, when confronted with the 
Carter news conference statem ent, a 
State D e p a rt m e n t official r e m a rk e d , 
“ T h e P r e s i d e n t w as e x p r e s s i n g his own opinion." 
Whether or not that is the case, how the Carter Administration resolves the 
M-X question should tell us a good deal both about how it intends lo allocate scarce resources between the military and civilian sectors of the economy and how important it thinks nuclear w ea­ pons are in our dealings with the So­ viets and in global politics generally. stet) in qualitative missile competition under SALT. For their p a r t . the So­ viets have concentrated mostly on im ­ proving the size — the “ throw-weight" and " y i e ld " — of their ICBMs. alth­ ough they have also rec en tly m a d e sig nificant i m p r o v e m e n ts in the a c ­ c u ra c y of th e i r w e a p o n s and in in - 

 hard to keep its considerable ICBM advantage over the Soviets intact. U.S. missile silos are h ard e r than the So­ viets, allowing th e m to b etter w ith ­ stand attack. 
U.S. missile are considerably more acc u rate, and a far m o re adva nced computerized targeting technology has given the U.S. better than a 2-1 lead over the Soviets in the num ber of nu­ clear w arheads. E ac h of our 55o i m ­ proved M in u tem a n III m is sile s will pack about 4oo kilotons of TNT power 
(the H ir o s h im a A -bom b was in the 
12-2o kiloton r an g e ), each will have th r e e i n d e p e n d e n t l y t a r g e t e d w a r ­ heads a c c u rate to within HOO feet of s e l e c t e d t a r g e t s w ith in th e Soviet 
Union, each will be in silos capable of withstanding at least 3,ooo pounds of pressure per s q u a re inch — and the system as a whole will be so com pu­ te ri z e d a s to be c o m p l e t e l y retarg e tab le every 3H m inutes. 
Search 
Still, the search has continued for an even better ICBM, one able to comple­ ment the Minuteman III force by fully neutralizing the g re a te r throvv-weight of the Soviet missiles and the roughly 
3-2 n u m e r i c a l a d v a n t a g e in ICBM launchers accorded the Soviets by the 
SALT I agreement. 
The M-X is the weapon settled upon by the Air Force, which runs our ICBM 

 s ill (VV . 
By any standard, the M-X shapes up as a truly awesome weapon. Each of the 3oo m issiles planned for deploy­ ment will contain up to 15 warheads independently ta rg e te d and packing a b o u t 2oo k il o t o n s of d e s t r u c t i v e power. 
In addition, the M-X will be even m o r e a c c u r a t e th a n th e i m p r o v e d 
M in u t e m a n Ills. G uid in g ea ch w a r ­ head will be an Advanced Inertial Re­ ferences S y s te m s (AIR S), weighing 
115 p o u n d s . 
Its c o r e , a 
1o-in ch -in -d iam eter “ floated b a l l . ” 

 will replace the liquid gyroscopes of the M in u tem an III, p e rm i ttin g even greater targeting precision. 
In its initial deployment stage the 
M-X will be accurate to within 3oo feet of selected targets. So-called “ te rm in ­ al guidance system s" permitting final targeting adjustments, will be availa­ ble for later generation M-Xs further to improve accuracy. 
It is an accepted m athem atical pro­ position that the doubling of a missile s accuracy is equivalent to an H O O per cent increase in throw-weight or yield. a prim e reason why the U.S., despite its rela tiv ely s m a l l e r m is s ile s , far exceeds the Soviets in the ability to destroy hardened silos. 
Destructive 
Further, due to what is known as the 
“ f r a t r i c i d e p h e n o m e n o n " — when more than two warheads are directed against a single target, they are like­ lier to kill each other than the target — tin* Soviets c a n n o t c o m p e n s a t e for th e ir a c c u r a c y p r o b le m by a i m i n g greater num be rs of missiles at a given target. Thus, the incredible accuracy of the M-X makes it a far more des­ tru c t i v e w eapon than a n y t h i n g th e 
Soviets have in the works. 
The solid fuel that will propel the 
M-X enables the missile to be “ cold- l a u n c h e d . " m e a n i n g that the s a m e launcher can be “ re-loaded" after each missile is fired. Since SALT limits the n u m b e r of l a u n c h e r s r a t h e r th a n missiles, there is as yet no theoretical limit to the number of M-X missiles we could fire at the Soviets or. for that m a t t e r , to th e n u m b e r of SS-18 missiles — also, “ cold-launched” — that they could fire at us. 
To ensure survivability, the M-X will be m obile. M obility s i m p l y m a k e s missiles harder for an opponent to zero in on and m eans that in a crisis enemy planners will have to choose between i g n o rin g o u r m o b il e m i s s i l e s a l t o ­ gether and “ drawing down” their own supply to th e point that they place th e m s e lv e s at a d i s a d v a n t a g e even should they score a direct hit. 
If U.S. m o bility co n v in ces Soviet s t r a t e g i s t s , for e x a m p l e , that they m ust em pty five of their own missile launchers for every U S. weapon they destroy, they would be foolish to attack our nuclear forces in the first place and. if they did, we would have more missiles left after the lirst exchange 
In early stages of research the Air 
Force considered and rejected plans to house the M-X in hardened stationary silos, in quicksand, in lakes, on trucks 

THIS ‘M A T A D O R ’ flying bom ber w as one of the first U.S. missiles developed during Cold W a r years 

 and on railroad trains. The m atter has now come down to a choice between 
“ s h e l t e rs ” — spaced, h ard e n ed and concealed silos, with the missile and la u n c h i n g m e c h a n i s m t r a n s p o r t e d from b u i l d i n g to b u i l d i n g — an d trenches. 
In an interview Air Force Ut. Gen. 
Alton I). Slay, Deputy Chief of Staff for research and development, indicated that trenches appear to be more cost­ effective than sh elte rs and are thus likely to em erge as the preferred home for the M-X 
In an article on the M-X in a recent issue of Air Force* Magazine, Slay de­ scribed the trench system. “ The m is­ sile transporter-launcher moves at ran d o m intervals inside the trench, p r o v i d i n g tota l u n c e r t a i n t y as to missile location along the length of the trench. An enemy must attac k the en­ tire tren ch to achieve a high-confi- dence expectation of des tro y in g the missile. Survivability is attained by providing m ore miles of trench than the e n e m y ’s attac k in g RVs can d e s ­ troy, P re l i m i n a r y analysis indicates that each could be on the order of Kl to 
21) miles long.” 
The M-X, then, represents more than 
2oo H i r o s h i m a s inside a nose-c one shuttling back and forth in a IO to 2o mile trench. Its size, deadly accuracy, multiple RVs, reloading capability and potential to survive or discourage an enemy attack make it something of a military strategist's dream. 

Many of these sa m e characteristics, however, make* the M-X an a r m s con­ t r o l l e r 's n i g h t m a r e . And th e r e a r e doubts even among those who are per­ suaded that the missile would neither promote instability and miscalculation 

 in a crisis nor present insurmountable 
SALT problems, they wonder whether the marginal security it would provide is worth anywhere near the cost of its d e v e l o p m e n t an d d e p l o y m e n t , and- whether the sort of strategic thinking it represents is not itself a th rea t to national survival. 
In short, the M-X could well become the most controversial nuclear system since the ABM itself and the subject of the next great American strategic d e ­ bate. 
Costly 
The cost of the weapon is s u b s t a n ­ tial. Gen Slay himself puts it at “ up­ wards of $2o billion." A figure of $34 billio n is h e a r d m o s t o ften f r o m sources on Capitol Hill. 
Independent a n a ly s ts , citin g both refinem ents in the system yet to be made and histories of cost over-runs in past s tr a t e g i c p r o g r a m s , have e s t i ­ mated costs as high as $5o billion be­ fore the M-X is fully deployed. An ad ­ ministration confronted with requests for m a j o r i m p r o v e m e n t s in both strategic and conventional p ro g ra m s and which has, in addition, pledged welfare reform, tax relief, mandatory national health insurance and financial as sista n ce to the cities m u st surely view the potential costs of the M-X with foreboding 
Nor can the prospect of 3,ooo to 6,ooo miles of tren c h e s in the continental 
United States be pleasing to many who would reside near them. Some would view them as potential t a r g e t s of a nuclear attack, others as u n s i g h t l y scars on the landscape — strip-mines never to be filled. In e i th e r ca s e a substantial constituency would likely form against them. 
Prisoners robbed of their rights 

WASHINGTON 
- 
Behind bars in the United States, the constitutional rights of the In­ carcerated American are rou­ tinely violated. The Constitution guarantees that he will not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Yet he is in daily danger of being raped, abused, beaten, even murdered. 

For the stark truth is that conditions are intolerable in all too many Am eri­ can prisons. The guards often contri­ bute to the abuse rather than protect the prisoners from it. Thus a prison sentence frequently becomes cruel and unusual punishment. 
Some of the nation’s worst prisons are located in Mississippi, which is now trying earnestly to improve them 
With the cooperation of the authorities.

O nly TV is r e a l 

WASHINGTON - Dr. Heinrich 
Appiebauin has just completed a study on the effects of television on children, lnniscase.though.it wasn't concerned with violence, but how television g iv e s children a false sense of reality. 

Dr. Appiebauin told m e, “ The greatest danger of television is that it presents a world to children that doesn't exist, and raises ex p ecta ­ tions that can never be fulfilled." 

"I don't understand. Doctor," I said. 

"Well, let me cite one example. 
Have you ever seen a television show where a person in an auto­ mobile doesn t immediately find a parking place on the very first try." 

" (o m e lo think of it." I said, "I haven't." 

“ Not only is there a lw a y s a parking spot a v a ila b le but (lie driver doesn't even have to back into it. T here are two park ing spaces available whenever someone in a TV show needs one. Children are being led lo believe that when they grow up they will always be able to find a parking place when and where they want it. ( a n you imagine the trauma when they dis­ cover that in real life you can drive around a block for three hours and still not find a place to put your car?" 

"I never thought of it but i f s true. 
What else do they show on television which gives a distorted picture of the real world ?" 

"Have you noticed that whenever a character walks out of a restaur­ ant or office building or apartment and says to the doorman, 'Get me a taxi,’ the taxi immediately arrives? 
Millions of children are under the impression that all a doorman has to do is blow his whistle and a taxi

 will be there. I have never seen a show where the doorman has said, i ' m sorry, I can't get you a taxi. 
You better take the bus."’ 

“ Of co u r se ." I sa id , “ I never knew before w hat both ered m e about those TY action programs; but som eh ow , there is a lw a y s a yellow taxi waiting offscreen." 

"Now," said Applebaum, "have you ever said to a taxi. 'Follow that car and don't lose him ’?" 

"Not really." 

“ W ell, if you had, the driver wouid have told you to blow it out your ear. No taxi driver is In a mood to follow another cur because that means he's going to get involved. 
Hut on TV every cabdriver looks as ii In d like nothing better to do than to drive 9o miles an hour through a rain-swept street trying to keep up with a car-full of hoods. And the worst thing is that the kids believe it." 

“ What e ls e discovered?" have you 

"Kids have a perverted sense ut what emergency wards of hospital are really like, On TV shows they take a kid to an em ergency ward and four d octors co m e ru sh in g down to bandage his leg. In a real lite situation the kid would be sit­ ting on the bench for two hours be lore he even saw an intern. On TV there always happens to be a ho 

 spital bed a v a ila b le when a kid n eed s it. What the kids in this country don't know is that so m e­ times you have to wait three days to get a hospital bed and then you have to put a cash deposit of ISO# down before they give it to you." 

Appiebauin said the cruelest hoax of all is when TY shows a lawyer defending som eone innocent of a crime. 

"On the screen the lawyer spends day and night digging up the evi­ dence to clear his or her client. In real life the lawyer says to the de­ fendant. ‘Look, I've got 2o minutes. 
Tell me your story and then ITI plead you guilty and make a deal with the DA.’ In real life the defen­ dant might say, Hut I’m innocent.’ 
The lawyer would say, 'So what? I can’t afford to find that out. I’m not 
Ferry Mason ’’’ 

"Then what you're saying, Dr. 
\pplebuum, is that it isn t the vio­ lence on TY but the fantasy that is doing harm to children." 

"Exactly. Even the commercials are taking their toll. Children are led to believe that when they grow up if they use mouthwash they’H find the mate of their dreams. When they don’t find him or her after gargling all night, they go into a tailspin, and many of them never come out of it." 

"What do you think is the biggest fear little girls have?" 

"I have no idea." 

“ I hat som ed ay when they get married their husbands will have ring around the collar." 

“ What about boys?" 

"Boys worry that they'll only go around once In life and they won t have all the gusto out of their beer that they deserve."

 barbershop didn't like the way he had been treating his fellow- De­ mocrat. 
President 
Carter. As related later by an aide. O’Neill was told: “ Give the guy a chance. Get off his back. 
Cut out all that fighting. 
Give him the benefit of the doubt.’’ 
According to the aide, it was more than just a personal rebuke to 
O’N eill. The message was that after eight years of warfare between a Re­ publican White House and a Democratic Con­ gress, the American peo­ ple are fed up. Now, with a Democratic President and a Democratic Con­ gress, they want peace. 
M essage 
“ The message you get from back home,” I he 
O'Neill aide said, “ is that they’re tired of the fight­ ing. They want some cooperation and I think the members of Congress w ill reflect that and they’ll cooperate.” 
What precipitated the outburst against O'Neill was the unusual specta­ cle of a Democratic Con­ gress treating a new De­ mocratic President as if he1 were the enemy. 
Even before he took of­ fice, Carter suffered the embarrassment of hav­ ing his first nominee to be CIA director. Theo­ dore (’. Sorensen, forced to withdraw because of congressional opposition. 
Then once Carter took office there was grum ­ bling from congressional 
Dem ocrats that he re­ garded the House and 
Senate with disdain, that phone calls were not re­ turned, that Congress was not consulted on key nominations. 
C arter, at his first press conference, ack­ nowledged there had been mistakes and pro­ mised to do better. 
His contrition, plus a rash of symbolic acts — the inaugural walk down 
Pennsylvania Avenue, the presidential sweater on television cam eras, his cutting down on go­ vernment limousines — all these seemed to score with the people, making

Carter has ignored Congress at times, and the lawmakers d o n 7 like it 

 him tho good guy and his critics bad guys. 
In any case, this was tho message read cm Ca­ pitol Hill. 
Irritation 
O 'N eill got tho mes­ sage. For days prior to tho barbershop visit, ho had boon peppering 
Carter with criticism. 
Tho Boston Irishm an was p articu larly in­ censed because the Pre­ sident had named a cou­ ple of Republicans to high federal posts with­ out consulting him. And the House speaker made no effort to hide his irri­ tation. 
But the barbershop in­ cident changed O’Neill’s tune. He returned to Wa­ shington talking sweet­ ness and light about his relations with the White 
House. And O’Neill isn’t the only one. 
Others say the P resi­ dent is becoming in­ creasingly popular in their home states and that the people don't like congressional sniping at him. 
“ People are very pleased with the Presi­ dent.” says Sen. Jam es 
B. Allen, an Alabam a 
Democrat. “ He is going over very well. He is much stronger than he was before the elec­ tions.” 
Prediction 
Allen predicts that if 
Carter’s popularity con­ tinues to grow it w ill have an effect on his le­ gislative program, most of which is yet to he un­ veiled. “ lf he succeeds in getting the support of the people. Congress will be mindful,” Allen says. 
The surge of popular support for Carter, with its attendant decision by at least some congres­ sional Democrats to stop throwing darts at their president, may have come just in time for the new administration. 
After years of stale­ mate between the White 
House and Capitol Hill, an enormous logjam of major issues has built up 
— energy, the economy, national health in su r­ ance, government reor­ ganization, to name only a few . 
W ith so much to do, and the responsibly so clearly fixed on the 
Democratic party, a con­ tinuation of the feuding between Carter and con­ gressional Democrats could spell serious trou­ ble for both — and for the nation as well. 
The roots of the friction are not hard to see. 
Each side has some built in problems. 
Carter, who except for 
Dwight I). Eisenhower is the only postwar Presi­ dent never to have served in Congress, campaigned against Washington (and that included Congress) and the bruises have not entirely vanished 
Trouble 
Also, after eight years of battling Republican presidents, congressional 
Democrats have exper­ ienced trouble in accus- taming them selves to dealing with a chief exe­ cutive of their own party. 
“ A lot of Democrats around here felt that when Carter was elected they were dem oted," 
Senate 
Republican 
Leader Howard IL Baker 
J r . , R-Tenn., recently remarked with a grin. 
This attitude prevailed among Dem ocrats, in part at least, because some three-fifths of the members of the House and Senate have come to 
Congress since a Demo­ crat, Lyndon B. Johnson, last occupied the White 
House. 
Given tins background, it i» perhaps not surpris­ ing that most of the cri­ ticism of the Carter 
White House thus far has come from Democrats 
They have complained loudly about being ig ­ nored on patronage plums. 

They have complained about phone calls not be­ ing returned They have complained uliout not be­ ing consulted before water projects back home were recommend­ ed for the junk heap 
The bitterest com ­ plaints of all have come from black and Hispanic 
House Democrats, Rep 
John Conyers J r . , D- 
M ich., a prominent member of the congres­ sional Black Caucus, re­ cently accused the presi­ dent of taking only half­ 

 way measures to combat unemployment 
“ The people are talk­ ing betrayal in the black question of how skilful! 

On that score, he pre­ dicted the administration would emerge with a fine record, although he ack­ nowledged there proba­ bly will be some tough fights, including one on the 19 w ater projects 
Carter wants to scrap 
Looming beyond the 

 com m unity,’’ Conyers said in an interview . 
“ They’re saying this proves there s not a dim e’s worth of differ­ ence between Republi­ cans and Democrats.” 
“ It galls me,” Conyers continued, contending it was the black vote that elected Carter. “ Carter is not going to have time to wipe the pie off his face, admit he is wrong and sail through Congress with a big jobs program. 
He won’t have that much time. He’s waltzing into a terrible political trap.” 
Although phrased in less hitter terms, Rep. 
Edw ard R. Roybal, D- 
C alif., had a sim ilar complaint about what he called a lack of adminis­ tration responsiveness in putting Hispanics in top jobs. 
“ I think that the Carter 
Adm inistration has shown a complete lack of sensitivity to the prob­ lems of the Spanish­ speaking Latinos,” Roy­ bal said. “ W7e have sub­ mitted over HOO names of qualified people, many with Ph Ds, and Master’s degrees, and all kinds of experience in various categories. Of those, with one or two exceptions, not a single meaningful appointment has been made.” 
If there is one person who has been the lightn­ ing rod for criticisms of the Carter White House it is a tall, heavy set and soft-spoken Georgian by the name of 
Frank 
Moore. 
Liaison team 
A 41-year-old former public relations man who has worked for Carter since 19HH, Moore is chief of the 17-member White 
House liaison team that deals with Congress. 
As the principal White 
House lobbyist, he is re­ sponsible for getting the 
President’s requests ap­ proved by Congress and for transm itting con­ gressional requests and concerns to Carter. 

The friction is clearly visible 

It is Moore who is blamed by congressman for calls to the W hite 
House that go unans­ wered, for lack of con­ sultations on the water project cutbacks and for failure of friends of members of Congress to land federal jobs. 
“ W e’ve had prob­ lem s,” Moore readily conceded in an interview in his office on the second floor of the White House west wing. “ I think we’re over them now. They're being rapidly correct­ ed." 
Most of Moore’s prob­ lems date hack to the hectic days immediately after Carter’s inaugura­ tion. “ We were getting 
2oo calls a day and we had only two people here to answer the phones,’’ 
Moore said. “ But now we are much more on top of it." 
This assessment is I both accepted and dis- I puled on Capitol HUL 
“ Things are im prov­ ing,” according to Senate j 
M ajority 
W hip 
Alan 
Cranston, D-Calif. “ A lot of little incidents were blown out of proportion j 
They are growing pains from lack of experience and lack of staff." 
Change 
A senior Senate Re- publican staff aide, however, believes ( arter 
“ needs a change in that liaison operation.” 
“ That's the one area,” the aide says, “ where they really made a great mistake in putting some­ body in charge of that kind of relationship who had no idea of where the 
Hill was. You’re bound to make mistakes because you just don’t know how it operates. It's not that you might not bt1 good ti you had the time to learn 
But that’s a hell of a place to try to break somebody in." 
In his own defense, 
Moore suggests lie has ben been judged per mu- turely. 
“ I think six months is a more realistic trial per­ iod to judge people rather than six weeks," Moore said 
"A n d success should be judged oil the passage of legislation ” 

Moore and tho rest of tin 
Adm inistration team prove to be is another problem of untested di­ mensions for Carter: the mood of assertiveness and independence that 
Congress developed while battling previous presidents over the Viet­ nam War, Watergate and other issues. 
Issue 
Moore sought to put this issue in a positive light. 
“ I think it w ill be a major opportunity,’’ he said. “ We have a very active President. I think we have an active Con­ gress. We have good le­ gislative initiatives come out of an assertive 
Congress. It will be very beneficial to us to share the work. Good work is being done on the Hill 

 that we would be doing ourselves otherwise.” 

But even with Carter’s new strength among voters, there are some 
Dem ocrats on Capitol 
Hill who view it differ­ ently. 

“ I’m predicting there’s going to be a Int of trou- 
< hie, a lot of problems.” 
♦.Rep W illiam M. Brod­ head, I)-M idi., said re­ cently. “ The Congress is not the same as it was eight years ago. the last time we had a 
Dem ocratic president. 
It’s just not disposed to go along.” 

Brodhead, who is typi­ cal of the young Demo­ cratic liberals swept into office in the wake of the 
1974 Watergate scandals, predicted trouble for 
Carter on a w ide range of issues, including energy, economic policy and so­ cial programs. 

Brodhead put it this way: 

“ C arter has talked about welfare reform and tax reform and national

 also talked about balanc­ ing the budget. I doubt very much he can do both. He is going to have to make his choice and whatever choice he makes, there are goingio he a lot of unhappy peo­ ple." 
Brodhead’s rem arks tend to bear out tho ob­ servations of several members of Congress that if Carter has diffi­ culties. they probably will come from liberals in his own party who feel he may not go far enough and fast enough on so- health insurance. He has . cial programs.

Conspirators in court battles 

WASHINGTON - Conspira­ tors who fixed prices of folding cartons containing such every­ day consum er products as toothpaste, toys and TV dinners are variously learning about jail, paying fines and slugging it out in court with claim ants seeking millions in damages. 
It’s not known how much the y e a r­ long conspiracy cost the buying public, but some estimates put the figure into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Federal antitrust lawyers who brought the massive criminal action say they have no doubts that inflated carton costs were passed along by soapmakers, food processors and other users of the billions of familiar con­ tainers. 
A look around your home at the number of products from pills to pet food that come in cartons should illus­ trate how. even at only a fraction of a cent per item, the over-all cost could mount. 

Notes 

Hundreds of pages of notes carefully handwritten and kept at home by 
Roman Hencel, a mid-level employe of 
YVeyerhauser Corp., are a centerpiece of the government’s evidence. 
The memos recorded calls and meetings in which carton manufac­ turers variously exchanged prices, agreed to support price increases, and arranged to submit seemingly com­ peting bids actually designed to pre­ serve business for a particular com­ pany. 
Hencel, now retired, was in the early 
197o’s an administrative assistant to 
Lowell Phillips, head of Weyerhauser’s folding carton division. 
Hencel, who acknowledged he helped fix prices during most of his 47 years in the folding carton business, kept me­ ticulous notes of his conversations. He startled prosecutors by carting in his treasure trove of unexpected details in response to a routine subpoena within 
IO days of the end of an 18-month grand jury investigation of the industry. 
A typical memo discussed the prob­ lem which arose when another Weyer- houser employe submitted a bid to produce candy boxes without clearing it through Hencel, and it turned out to be lower than the price at which Crane 
Carton Co. had been selling the par­ ticular item to that buyer. 
“ Alan Crane called ... asked about above quote. I called him back & found that against our (bid of) 51.25M ($51.25 per thousand cartons) he has been getting 54.75M. He ... asked what we will do if given an order at 51.25M. I told him I could circumvent that & would call him if we get an order. 

“ I called Norm — told him the story and said if we get an order, we should do nothing but call me. We then can go back to customer, tell him we made a mistake & say our price is 55 or 56.oo. 
If we get the order at this price, there is no problem — I will simply call Alan 
& tell him .” 
Twenty-three corporations doing 7o per cent of the business in the $1.7 billion-a-year folding carton industry were indicted along with 5o of their executives. That dollar volume does not include other packaging such as corrugated shipping cartons, which is considered a separate industry. 
Measured by number of defendants, it was the largest antitrust case since the Roosevelt administration, and one of the government’s most noteworthy price-fixing prosecutions since the electrical industry case of the early 
19oo’s. 
One of the smaller corporate defen­ dants was convicted earlier this year on the conspiracy charge brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The other 22 pleaded no contest — meaning they didn’t admit the charges, but otherwise suffered the same result as if they had pleaded guilty. 

No contest 

Forty-eight of the executives also pleaded no contest. The other two were acquitted at trial by a jury when the government could not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the two knew of and ordered price-fixing by lower-level employes. 
Fifteen of the executives originally were sentenced to jail terms ranging from five to HO days in jail. But U.S. 
District Judge James B. Parsons in 
Chicago reduced those sentences last month to from one to 15 days. 
All of the executives and corporate defendants were fined varying amounts up to $5o,ooo, and some of the executives not given jail sentences were put on probation. 
Judge Parsons put under seal, away from public scrutiny, more than 1,ooo pages of government material sum­ marizing evidence of the conspiracy. 

But at least some details of the scheme became public at the trial of the corporation and two individuals who pleaded innocent. 
D. Bruce Pearson, the government’s chief prosecutor in the case, told a jury that the common purpose and design of the “ countless price exchanges among, between folding carton companies .. w as to provide cover,... cover meaning that when you receive another com pany’s prices it was with the under standing that you cover them, you bid higher than those prices that you receive.”

By VERONICA 
SALAZAR 
Manuel M. Espar­ za is dedicating him­ self to helping young 
Mexican- Americans who are poor, re ­ tarded and handi­ capped. 
Ile p ictu res him self some 5o years ago when he w as young and poor — not being able to do any­ thing about it but accept the circumstances — and not having anyone to turn to. 
But now th e re is so ­ mething he can do and that is to help the less fortunate, the disabled and disadvantaged to be­ come better citizens by not losing their dignity. 
Esparza, HO, is voca­ tional adjustm ent coor­ d inator of 
Southside 
School District. His stu­ dents are all from the 
Villa Coronado area. 
They a re between the ages of 16 and 2o, and the m a jo rity are h a n d i­ capped 
The program includes job training plus super- v im rig trainees in jobs. 

I r e m e m b e r g o i n g w i t h o u t lun ch a t t i m e s b e c a u s e t h e y u s e d to l a u g h when I to o k m y taco lu n c h " 

E s p a r z a is te a c h e r , confidante, sponsor and supervisor. Because of the varied handicaps his students have, extra pa­ tience and understanding are required. He tries to get p a r e n ts . other teachers and employers to understand the special requirements for success of the program. 
Hardships 
He not only e x p e r ­ ienced the hardships of being poor once but has also suffered the conse­ quences of being dis­ abled 
A World War ll veteran, E sparaza was wounded five different times and is perhaps one of the most d e c o ra te d veterans. 
It is his country now but it w a sn 't then b e ­ cause the two y ears 
Esparza spent in the U S. 
Army he was a Mexican citizen. Between 1943 and 
1945 he receiv ed the 
Silver Star, Bronze Star. 
Combat Infantry Badge and Croix de Guerre. He was r e c o m m e n d e d for the Congressional Medal of Honor but he refused it. 
“ I felt I was not enti­ tled for it. The person who deserved it was the one who gave his life for his c o u n t r y ,’* says 
Esparza, 

He enlisted in the 
Army in January of 1943. 
At the time Mexican citi­ zens were permitted to enlist. He went overseas as a private but later was commissioned a second lieutenant at the recom­ mendation of 
Gen. 

George Patton. 
At the tim e E sp a rz a wanted to b ecom e an 
A m erican citizen but every time an appoint­ ment was set for him to complete naturalization proceedings he was al­ ways in the war's front line. 
On one occasion, he re­ calls. an a p p o in tm e n t was set for I p.m. Iii the meantime, the Germans had overrun the U.S. 2nd 
Division positions and 
Esparza quickly reported for duty. The a p p o in t­ ment and c itizenship p a p e rs sim ply had to wait. 
Finally 
E sp a rz a finally b e ­ came an American citi­ zen in June, 1945. while hospitalized in Modesto. 
Calif. All disabled veter­ ans receive a terminal leave check upon their discharge. 
Esparza’s was for IO cents; he still has the check and cher­ ishes it along with all his military decorations. 
E sp a rz a re tu rn e d to 
San Antonio in 1945. dis­ abled and unable to work. But the training in printing that he had as a y o u n gster was put to good use. He opened his ow ii printing business. 
After IO years he felt he was overworking himself so in 1959 he went to 
Edgewood as a printing instructor. He stayed fol­ io years 
At Edgewood Esparza pioneered the methods of offset p rin tin g which were later implemented in other schools throughout the state. He has been worked at 
Southside since 1974 
A native of P ie d ra s 
Aegras. Esparza came to the l .S. at the age of ll). 
His family settled in Se­ m en ilk*. Texas. 
Ile recalls sta rtin g school without knowing a word of English. “ Dis­ crimination was my worst enemy. I was ll) years old when I wore my first pair of sh o es. I re­ m e m b er going without lunch at times because they used to laugh when I took my taco lunch,” he says. 
Laborer 
When attending high school he worked as a laborer making $3 a week to help him buy clothes for the school year. Iii the summers he picked cot­ ton until he found a job helping a printer. lie graduated from 
Somerville High School hi 1937 and enrolled in 
Bliun Junior College in 
B re n h a m , where he e a rn e d his associate degree iii 1939. Esparza was the first Mexican- 
American to attend col lege at Blum and the first to graduate from there 
He worked 
Ins way through school as a jam tor, g a r d e n e r or what ever became available. 
He also participated in sports — track, baseball and basketball. He was 

 captain of the baseball and basketball teams. 
Because of his athletic ability Esparza obtained a scholarship to study law. He enrolled in law school at St. Mary’s Uni­ versity in 
1941 but dropped after a year be­ cause his scholarship had run out. 
Esparza was success­ ful in his military career because he always tried to out-do the other guy. 
“ I believe in doing twice as much work. My philo­ sophy has always been to out-do the other g u y ’s record. I also believe in starting from the bottom and working myself iii).” he explains. 

While te a c h in g at 
Edgewood E sp a rz a ob­ tained his bachelor of a r ts d e g re e from St. 
M a ry 's U n iv ersity in 
1968. He also has a voca­ tional certific ate from 
Texas University and a special education certifi­ cate from Texas A&I 
University. 
Attendance 
Iii the 18 y ears that 
Esparza has been teach­ ing he has not missed a day of school. 
Esparza initiated the vocational p ro g ra m at 
Southside ISI) in 1974. All of his students are han­ dicapped — either m en­ tally or physically r e ­ 

 tarded. At present he has 
18 youths enrolled and 17 employed in jobs ranging from mechanics, bakers, gas station a t t e n d a n t s and bus boys to dish w ash ers, brick layers and co n stru c tio n workers. 
He has his own driv ing school. “ There is no bus serv ice in Villa Coronado to town and the students need to learn some type of t r a n s p o r t a t io n ,” he explains. Esparza says the students get what is called a hardship driver's license. 
E sp a rz a also works v ery closely with parents who don’t realize their children are mentally re­ 

 tarded. “ The student can be 16 years old but his reading capacity is that of grade one and some of the parents are not aware of this,” he says. 
Esparza has served as president of the Westside 
O p tim ist Club and is presently serving as pres­ ident of the Texas State 
T e a c h e rs A ssn .-South­ side chapter. 
He is recipient of nu­ merous citations for his service to the communi­ ty. 
He has received plaques from the YMCA, 
Optimists Club and Tex­ as Rehabilitation Com­ mission. He is also reci­ pient of the Outstanding 
P r i n ti n g 
In s tr u c to r 
Award. 
Esparza is married to the fo r m e r Jo se p h in e 
Murguia and they have one daughter.

San Antonio EX P R ESS-N EW S— 
Sunday March I 3 I 97 7 

LOS ANGELES TIMES 
ARCADIA, Calif. 
— They are of both sexes, all ages and colors. They arrive dressed in suits and shorts, in tee-shirts, tank tops and turtle­ necks. 

Most bring reference material of varied nature and depth. Some carry babies. Others have chil­ dren by the hand or on a leash. A few tote folding chairs. Some bring bags filled with food and drink. 
All hope to go home with mote than they came with. It is one of two common denomina­ tors. The other is that they will see little of what they came to see. 
These are the railbirds. the race track devotees who stand closest to the course, lining the barrier from stretch turn to 

 clubhouse turn. 
In some ways they are like members of a golf gallery, for they will view only parts of the action, never the whole. 

Intimacy 
But, in general, this is a breed with other things in mind. a moment of in­ timacy with rider and horse. The chance to de­ tect something that might influence the run­ ning. The opportunity to turn a jockey’s head with an obscenity or word of praise. A chance to be on top of the action in the same way a crap shooter is when he calls for a hard eight; the illusory feeling of participating, of being part of the gla­ mor, of shaking a hum­ drum existence. 

Some accept it for what it is, an afternoon of re­ laxation and fun. Others will carry the frustration

An hour before first post at Santa Anita the rail is empty. The warm sun has driven early ar­ rivals into the shade of the grandstand. The call to post w ill bring them down to the rail. They have paid their $2.5o general admission and can stand just about any­ where they want. 
The post parade is why many took up railbird­ ing. It is an opportunity to st inly the horse and rider close up, to look for a telltale facial expres­ sion by the jockey, a dis­ play of nerves by the horse.

It is midweek and there is room to move, to breathe at the rail. On weekends, they are packed in, a sea of hu­ manity from the rail hundreds of feet back to the betting w indows. 
“ You have to come with someone and take turns making your bets,” says a woman, who this time had come alone, “or there’s no way to hold your spot.” 
Another woman over­ hears, and smiles. She says her name is Ethel 
Wroblewski and that she is vacationing from Mil­ waukee. She generally goes to Chicago’s Arling­ ton Park, she says, and the rail is always crowd­ ed. 
“ It’s true,” she says. 
"You can’t sec a damn thing down here, but this is where I love it. I’d rather be here than in a box seat. I can see a hockey’s expression, the determination of the jockey and the horse as they cross the wire. I just love horses. I’d go watch them if they were pulling a garbage wagon.

“ So many people out there couldn t con­ ceive of what it was really all about,” Boyette mused and illustrated what he meant. 
“I got off the news one day and had a tele­ phone call from this little old lady. She said to me. ‘Mr. Boyette, I didn’t want this television set in my home but my sister's son said I had to have it. 
Now, it doesn t happen on all programs but it happens on yours,’ she told me. ‘I know that when we’re watching you, you’re watching us and I don’t mind that but sister doesn’t al­ ways watch the way she dresses around the house.” ’ 

The story is cute in today’s easy acceptance of live coverage from the moon but it had a poignant ending when the little old lady showed up at the station, claiming she would be put away unless Boyette testified he, in­ deed, was watching her through her tele­ vision.

Another fond memory of the early Channel 
5 newsman is his confrontation with youth on 
Continued on next page 

Newsman then did everything 
By RICHARD ERICKSON 
The cold, clear light of San Anton­ io’s new era of Instant Communica­ tion dawned early one Decem ber evening in 1949. 
Television, hailed as the educational hope of the future and cursed as the idiot box, had come to the Alamo City. 
The beginnings ofChannel 4, VVOAI-TV, were not glorious. In fact, they weren’t even very dramatic. 

After local politicians and civic leaders self-consciously congratulated each other on this new achievement, and welcomed pre­ sent-day KMOL-TV to the city, viewers hun­ grily watched an SMU-Notre Dame football game that was two weeks old. 
SMU, by the way, lost the game, 2o-27, even with the help of “ local boy Kyle Rote in action against the vaunted South Bend Supermen.” 

The rest of that first evening included a ventriloquist and his dummy, a variety pro­ gram with Gypsy Rose Lee and, of course, there was the news. 

Pat Boyette, then a local newscaster for 
RTSA radio and soon to be one of the pioneers of San Antonio television, remembers those times. 
“ ITI never forget it,” he said from his northwest area home. “ I bought this tiny television and it was a funny looking thing with a 7-inch screen. 
“ It was one of those quiet fall evenings and 
I came home with this box, plugged it in and, immediately, this picture came on. 

“ Here was this guy, skiing down the slopes. 
Guy, it was the most exciting thing you can imagine: here were motion pictures in the home. And you knew you were on the thre­ shold of something big.” 

Two months later, KEYL-TV, Channel 5. made its debut and shortly after that, Boyette became its newsman. 
His opinion of something big remained, he 

 recalled. Whether or not it was something good was another matter. 
“ I was leery of television then as I am now,” Boyette, now a successful cartoonist explained. “ I said at the time, here is the most powerful influence in the world. I knew people were going to sit glued to the front of this thing and they did in those early days. 

“They would sit there and watch Smokey the Bear with great delight over and over again. They were hypnotized by this thing ” 
It was dangerous, said Boyette, it was a monster. It makes participants into specta­ tors, secretly influencing thought and opin­ ions. 
But it was also a powerfully attractive force. He stayed with it, off and on. for nearly 
2o years. 
People, at first, found the tube with its instant personalities a little hard to accept. 
No one was really sure of the extent of its

 he has many criticisms of today’s version of television news but a number of Pat 
Boyette’s comments fall into two contro­ versial areas: news v and television violence 
“ As long as newscast* ing was exactly that, a report of the news that we believed to be, the mom ents or events of importance, then it was a worthwhile endeavor. 
“ But somewhere along the line. it ceased to be a newscast and became a radio show. And the minute it became a radio show and television news started worrying about ratings, then it became something less than de­ dicated. 
“ It becam e, to my mind, entertainment.” 
Functions 
Boyette feels television serves two different functions, entertainment and information. It was a concept, he noted, that brought him many disa­ greements with manage­ ment. 
“ We had 18 hours a day to entertain and sell. We had maybe an hour a day to justify our miserable existence and that hour should be dedicated to a newscast that was pre­ sented as honestly and as forthright as we could make it without worrying about ratings. 

T h e

K en n ed y sh o o tin g s e e m e d lik e a s u m m e r reru n o f an e a r lie r tragedy 

“ So for that short per­ iod of time during the broadcast day. we could stop being a jukebox, stop saying ‘If you drop a nickel in, we ll play your song,’ and just be honest for that time. 
Don't know 
“ But that never came about and it hasn’t come about yet.” 
The 195os anchorman prefaces his remarks on violence by saying he is not an expert and has made no scientific studies. 

 erses entertainment 

"How m a n y p e o p l e r e a lly s e p a r a t e th e fact fr o m th e fiction?* 
“ I'm not one of these guys who are going to get up and say th ere’s too much violence on tele­ vision. I don’t know about that. 
“ But when you have 18 hours of violence with a certain num ber of m urders occurring in that time and, all of a sudden, you come to the newscast and a guy re­ ports another murder, it becomes just another murder in a w hole string of murders. 
“ And I question how many people really se­ parate the fact from the fiction?” 
Boyette notes, to prove his point, the television m urder of President 
John F. Kennedy. 
“ What a trau m atic thing it was but then a short period later, Bobby 
Kennedy was shot, and — please don’t get me wrong. I'm not trying to bt1 flippant —- it was just like watching a summer rerun. 
Numbing 
“ It just deadens the senses.” 
One of the main differ­ ences between yesterday and today in television journalism, Boyette rea­ dily admits, is the view of the medium. 
“ I ’ve always consi­ dered myself as much a newspaper animal as I did a radio and television guy.” 
H e lists his many friends from that era, friends who went on to work for many m ajor news services both print and broadcast. 
“Those are the guys I grew up with and. to them, news and writing were things apart. It was a life and I just don’t see that in today’s new s­ casts.”

They even did commercials 
Continued from previous page live television. 
‘‘Everything was live then. You were naked to the world and your mistakes were your own. 
“ My 6 p.m. newscast was preceded by a kids show which w as the big vogue at the time and since we came out of the same studio, there was only about 15 minutes to clear the kids out before I went on. 
“ Well, this day the host was passing out candy and he didn’t get them out. I started the newscast over in my little corner with all the dire happenings of the day when this little kid came over, walked right in front of me, leaned on the desk and said, ‘You're Pat 
Boyette!’ “ 
“ I confessed that I was and he said. My daddy just can’t stand you on television.’ And where the hell do you from there? You throw the script in the air and forget about the whole thing." 
As fond as those memories are to Boyette these day s, they d o n ’t m ake up for the m edium’s basic w eak n ess and, he believes, modern performers exploiting that w eakness 

“ I think television, by its very structure, is superficial. I think it is people standing in front of cardboard sets. I think the walls are papier-mache. 
"I have done a newscast sitting there with a coat and tie on and just my shorts. Everyth­ ing is make-believe and, unfortunately, that make-believe is carried over into the news aspect also.” 
Although he acknowledges it sounds like sour g ra p e s, Boyette believes the studio newsman today, the anchorman, is basically a newsreader rather than a reporter. 
“ And damn poor readers, I might add. I just can’t get over the hair spray bit. I expect a newscaster to look like he just came in from the field, not from makeup.” 
But hasn t television news opened new avenues of inform ation, new vistas to the nation’s viewers? 
“ Yes, to some incredibly incapable people. 
I think newscasters should look and sound like newscasters. 

“ I think that when they say something they should sound like they know what they are talking about. It would be delightful if they really knew what they were talking about 
“ And some of the people they have on these stations couldn’t convince me they have the vaguest idea of what they are talking about. 
To open up vistas? For what?” 
One vital thing missing from today’s tele­ vision newsman. Boyette says, is experience. 
“ There were no writers, no teleprompter, not like it is today where you cut back to the studios when you have a dull moment at a remote. 
“ I feel sorry for guys in broadcasting today because they simply do n.>t get an opportunity to have a background like we had. 
"We did everything, there was nothing we hadn't tried at one time or another.” lie recalled an exam ple from his radio days. “ We were going to cover the first San 
Antonio blackout during the war. We did it from the top of the M ilam Building. We 

 waited and then the magic moment had come: all the lights went out. 
“ And then it hit us, what the hell do you talk about for 25 minutes, sitting in the dark?” 
But for all his criticism of studio newsmen, 
Boyette has nothing but praise for today’s television street reporters. 
“ They are doing a better job than we used to do. It was just not convenient for us to do all of this stuff on the scene We simply didn’t have the equipment to do that kind of thing. 
“ Secondly, the role of a television reporter has changed, the emphasis has changed.” 
The change, he believes, is more in-depth, behind-the-scenes reporting. “ When an offi­ cial made a statement, we accepted it at face value. He would say som ething and that's what we reported. 
“ But today, this inept reporting has brought about an awareness of the probing of local happenings that we didn't pay any at­ tention to.” 
In that probing, however, television news has opened itself to the old specter of the hidden advocacy, the slanted view of the re­ porter so critically pointed out by former 
V ice President Spiro Agnew .

Not ju st town crier 
TV news 

Chris Marrou of Channel 5's Eyewitness 
News of the 197os quickly points out he d oesn ’t have the exp erien ce of a Pat 
Boyette. 

Lightweight 8 x lo ’canvas cabin tent 

But that doesn t p re ­ vent Marrou from having definite opinions on his craft. 
“ I think we have gotten away from the ‘town crier’ aspect of news and more into the ‘next door neighbor’ aspect. 
“ P eople at the tim e 
(195os) expected the an­ chorman to be very for­ mal and to be that kind of a town c r ie r concept where he was not speak­ ing to anyone in particu­ lar, bt* was just reading off the n e w s,” M arrou said firmly. 
“ lf you are being such a person, you cannot put your personality into it. 
Now people feel you a m ore hum an being — which we are. we live in town and are just people like ev eryone else. 
Personality 
“ I think they want to feel that we have a d e­ finite personality, that w e’re just like the guy who might live next door and tell them what hap­ pened today.” 
Channel 5’s top-rated newsman adds that a lot of criticism comes from people who believe newspaper journalism is a hard and fast standard for all media to adhere to, 

“ Television is going to have to In* judged on its own and. to some extent, it inclu des e n t e r ta in ­ m ent. But look at the newspaper. 
“ You have a full two pages of funnies in there everyday and you c a n ’t say the n e w sp a p e r d e ­ graded itself by going for e n te rta in m e n t. W here are you going to draw the line?” 

'I wouldn't be anywhere else* 

Marrou downplays the effect of television vio­ lence but adm its a c u r­ rent view er has given him a few questions to think about 
Small part 
“ I think violence is a part of life and I think people w orry about it but. although it is a part of news in any city, it is not a big part 
“ Even on a particular* 

TV news shouldn't he com pared dir­ ectly with newspapers 

Iv violent day, it doesn’t c o n stitu te m ore than about IO to 15 per cent of the entire newscast and you can put a stopwatch to that.” 
However, it stays with the view ing public longer, be notes, and that could be one reason that som e feel th e re too is much. 
“ We received a letter here at the station a few weeks ago w here a wo­ m an said she w as u n ­ happy about a story we had. 
“ She said she did not mind violence on the fic­ tional TV program s but she did not like it on the news and that really dis­ turbs me. 
All right 
“ Because if the news were to have no violence and it was to continue in the fictional areas, there would be even m o re a problem of people think­ ing it would be all right to shoot someone because soon there will be an­ o th e r c o m m e rc ia l and h e’ll get up and walk off." 
M arrou believ es the reality of the news hap­ pening to real people til 
San Antonio h o p e fu ls can reinforce the reulitv of v iolenet* itself 
“ People w ant to see things like this when thev happen and I don’t think it is (Ult of morbid curio­ sity more titan anything else. 
“ I think they just want to see what happens in their town . . . and s o ­ metimes. ifs v iolent,” 
He suggests it might be in te re s tin g to look 2b years iii the future to see how televisio n has changed by then. 
“ Television is con­ stan tly c h a n g in g , e x ­ panding, moving laster than anything else you can im agine aud it has become a huge part of 
American life, more than 
I would have thought even five or IO years ago 
“ And I wtjuldn t Ik* an­ ywhere else “

Carm el’s love /h ate affair with tourism 
Souvenirs, anyone? 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CARMEL - BY - 
THE 
- 
SEA, 
Calif.—Find a fun place to live, and tourists will be ritfht behind to enjoy for a few hours or a few days what you have all year round. 
The 5,(17o residents of this Monterey Peninsula town, founded at the turn of the century as a w rite rs' and a r t i s t s ’ colony, want the sight­ seers because they help keep their taxes low Hut they d on’t want tour buses belching fumes and funneling folks in and out by the hour. Nor do they want the fast-fond chains and cheap souvenir stands that fol­ low. 
As far back as 1924. when P e rry Newberry was mayor, 
Carm el wrestled with the prob­ lem. Newberry’s answer, promptly ignored, was to fence in the town to keep the tourists out. 
Today, one suggestion 
-is for a “ hum an sa n c ­ t u a r y ” fenced in by total local control of the area. 
Aims 
“The town is aimed at people who come for overnight or a week or lo n g er.” said 
David 
Hughes, vice mayor and owner of David's, an art, 
‘jewelry and shoe store tentering to visitors. 
“ We’re not geared for an influx of tourists.” i City officials are care­ ful to point out that there are two kinds of tourists — the "two-hour wonders” and the guests. 
The difference between them is the key to the survival of Carmel and other communities which rely on the tourist trade. 

"Any place like this has a right to restrict the intrusion o f outsiders' 

Carmel presses to its sandy bosom the 
“ g u e s ts ,” those who spend one or more nights in tile city's hotels and motels, eat in her re s­ taurants. buy local arts and c ra fts and attend cultural events. T h a t’s because KT per cent of the c o m m u n ity ’s revenue comes from lodging and sales taxes. 
The others, the "two- hour w onders.” topple off tour buses, look for a bathroom, eat only con­ venience foods, buy souvenir plates and litter the hilly stre e ts with candy wrappers before climbing back onto the bus. 
Trouble 

* The tour buses still come, but a city ordin­ ance has halted their travel on the town’s nar­ row s tr e e ts. They no 

 longer clog traffic near the curving beach. They must enter on one desig­ nated road and p a rk along one d e sig n a te d street. 
Richard Tevis, catalyst of a group called STAAT, or Sensible Citizens Are 
Anti-Tourist, one of several groups formed from the fertile soil of antitour ism, says Carmel always has had trouble with tourists. He also says that the town, where the problem has m ulti­ plied in the past Kl years, lias become a pioneer in controlling the invasion. 
“ The real issue,” he says, "is the question of the community’s right to self-determination. I feel very strongly that any place like this, a lovely and fragile spot where the great majority are non-business residents, has a right to restrict the intrusion of outsiders.” 

One ma yor p ro p o se d p u t­ ting a fence ar­ ound the town to keep tourists out 

To preserve its charm, 
Carmel has no traffic lights, no home mail delivery, few street signs and no sidewalks in re­ sidential areas. 
To prevent any erosion of that c h a r m , it forbids neon signs, discount stores, chain and drive-in r e s ta u r a n ts and b u ild ­ ings of more than two stones. 
It also has a short-term m orato riu m on new commercial construction over IR.OOO square feet, although a new shopping mall is nearing comple­ tion at the north end of the downtown business area. 
Controls 
Several y ears ago, 
Gunnar Norberg, now the mayor, wanted to go even further to preserve the town. He proposed a He­ ritage 
City, a plan rejected several times by the state legislature. As 
Norberg describes it. the concept would provide a 
“ human sanctuary” by placing development in­ side the city under the control of the city coun­ cil. 
Under the plan, city officials would have the right to approve any new freeway construction in­ side the heritage area. 
Stricter pollution con ­ trols could be e s t a b ­ lished. All land zoning could be frozen, aud even return to lower levels — commercial to residen­ tial — and the size and type of business could In* restricted by the council. 
Norberg still has hope that the plan will Im1 ap­ 

 proved, thus sav ing Car­ mel and setting an ex­ ample for other Califor­ nia communities with sim ilar p roblem s 
— 
Mendocino, high on the north coast, and Bolinas, a tiny town on lush 
Duxbury Loint in Marin 
County north of San 
Francisco. 
Mendocino, settled in 
1852, always has been at­ tractive to tourists, and the town is worried about its future. When a former restaurant chain owner, 
Bob Peterson, bought

 several 
Main 
Street properties, resid en ts became upset. Bum per stickers reading "Don’t 
Carmelize Mendocino” appeared when he reno­ vated the sta te ly old 
Mendocino Hotel and an­ nounced plans to demo­ lish a no th er s tr u c t u r e nearby and erect an artists’ sanctuary. 
Bolinas set up signs banning visitors last summer when water was scarce. Many residents called for a permanent ban, and there still is a 

 problem with scruffy wanderers who drift id with the warm weather. 
But C arm el, the old mission town about 125 miles south of San Fran­ cisco and just off U.S. I, the highway that winds along the rugged Pacific 
Coast almost the entire length of the state, is the most famous. And its controls seem to be working. 
The tourists still come, but as Norberg says, 
“ People who come here say ‘Ilow is it that you have kept so much when it seems to d isa p p e a r everywhere else?’ 
“ I am only sorry I could not save more,” 
THIS NEW shopping center would be welcome in many cities, but some Carmel residents view it with animosity

ARMAGH. 
Northern Ireland — 
Two lofty 
Gothic cathedrals, one 
Catholic, the other

F r o m th e ir s e p a r a t e vantage points, the Cath­ olic c a r d i n a l and the 
Anglican a r c h b i s h o p , each with the title 
“ P r i m a t e of 
All

1969. 
Friends 
In pondering the Irish q u e s tio n , in t r y i n g to figure why Catholics are killing P ro t e s t a n t s and v ice versa, and whether the British should get out of I re lan d or the C a t h ­ olics give in to the 2-1

2-K Son Antonio EXPRESS-NEWS— Sundoy March 13 1977 TV tones down violence 

PRODUCER D avid G e rb e r defends his police TV shows from critics of violence 
AP WIREPHOTO 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

LOS ANGELES — Television violence is not dying, but there are signs that it is slowly fading away. 
Generally, network spokesmen say that current popular shows will not be dropped because of violent themes, but recent directives probably will limit the number of new action shows slated in the fall and possibly further into the future. 
Some are taking the trend in stride; others, like David Gerber, executive producer of “ Police S to ry ” and 
“ Police Woman,” are biting the bullet, contending that the end of tub e violence ultimately would m ean the downfall of action adventure shows. 
Pressure 
“ Pressure groups, not the viewing audience at large,” says Gerber, “ are leveling such broad strokes at televi­ sion that they are crippling any a t­ tem pt at honesty in d ra m a , honest reality, or just plain entertaining ac­ tion shows, which people are entitled to. 
“ They are ruining serious quality, hour-long dram as.” 
A censor for NBC, w hich buys 
Gerber's two police shows, admits that the pressure groups are m aking an 

'We're saying enough o f that. We ’re trying new a v e n u e s says NBC Presi­ dent Robert T. Howard 

 impression. 
“ We have certainly been not u n ­ aware of the various groups which have been complaining about violence on television, and we have reacted to the extent that we have been examin­ ing the area much more carefully than before,” says .Jerome H. Stanley, NBG vice president of broadcast standards for the West Coast. 
Among the g ro u p s d e c ry in g TV violence are the A m erican Medical 
Association, the Parent-Teachers As­ sociation.and the National Citizens 
Committee for Broadcasting. 
Monitor 
Some m em bers of the advertising industry have vowed to monitor more closely where their dollars are spent, and the U.S. surgeon general has ten­ tatively indicated that TV violence could have an effect on children. 
NBG president Robert T. Howard has called for a reduction in violence. 
“ We’re saying, ‘enough of that.* We’re going to try new avenues.” 
ABC Vice P re sid e n t A lfred R. 
Schneider, in a recent speech, makes 

 clear that his network plans to contin­ ue some violence as part of a diver­ sified program mix. But, he said, “ it is cle a r th at g ra tu ito u s , e x cessiv e violence serves no useful purpose.” 
CBS’ Dick Kirschner, the West Coast program practice chief, doesn’t see anti-violence as a new m o v em en t. 
“ We’ve been involved in trying to cut down violence since 1968.” 
.Joseph T. Naar, producer of ABC's popular “ Starsky and H utch,” says network officials have not told him directly to limit violence but “ they have told us we can explore humor, we can explore character a little m ore.” 
Stop 
“ T hey ’ll just have to stop doing police shows, because police shows are not about conversation, you know ,” says M eta R osenb erg , ex ecu tiv e producer of “ The Rockford Files,” a private detective series on NBC. Mrs. 
R osenberg d o e sn 't condem n the crackdown and hopes, like Naar, that 
“ wit and dialogue” can be effective substitutes. 
But she notes that censors “ have

WASHINGTON - 
Outside the heavily guarded doors of his favorite organiza­ tion's m id-w inter convention, 
Paul 
Synder w as saying that fraternalism may hold the answer to the world’s prob­ lems. 
“ The trouble with the 
Moose is they hide their head under a bushel bas­ ket," he declared impas- sionately. “ My favorite expression is we succeed in spite of ourselves." 
The Loyal Order of the 
Moose is u n a b a sh ed ly g u n sh y . B ack in 1972 when the U.S. Supreme 
C ourt w as d e b a tin g w h e th e r Moose lodges could exclude blacks, it w as under all kinds of heat from the lib eral press and politicians. 
Fear 
A wave of fear swept through the Moose’s 2,ooo lodges — but not for the reasons one might think. 
“ People thought there would be a m ass exodus of w h ites from the o r ­ g a n iz a tio n , or a m a ss movement of blacks into it,’* explained Synder, the president of a savings and loan co m p a n y in 
Edgemere, Md., w ho was attending a recent Moose convention in YVashing- 

 tte kind to ani­ mals — Kiss 
Moose, says a lapel button on a Moose 

 toil. 
T his d id n ’t h app en , alth ou gh Moose Lodge 
1o7 in H arrisb urg , Pa., was eventually ordered to a d m it gu ests on a non­ discriminatory basis and the national organization dropped the whites-only clause from its constitu­ tion. 
“ In the long run, it was the best thing that ever happened. It got the issue into the open and it didn t c h an g e a n y th in g ,’’ 
Synder, a mem ber of the 
Supreme Moose Council, th e g r o u p ’s gov ernin g board, said, ‘‘Everyone realized blacks were do­ ing their thing and we’re doing out thing.” 
Not only did the Moose survive, if s membership m u sh ro o m e d from 
946.ooo in 1972 to 1.2 mil­ lion today in an age w hen many fraternal organiza­ tions are losing members and seem as archaic as the buggy whip. It now claim s not only President

Billy Carter. 
No one seems to know how many blacks are now 
Moose, but i f s not many. 
“ I think I saw one at the la st n a tio n a l c o n v e n ­ tion,” said Moose publi­ c ity d ir e c to r 
J a m e s 
(tawlings. “ He was at the m e e tin g s an d w as o b ­ viously black. So, there are some apparently.” 
Small 
T h e o r g a n iz a tio n ’s m e m b e r s h ip in m any large cities is small. 
One problem for an al- m ost*ail w hite group is the location of the Moose’s only lodge in Washington a t 372o M a rtin L u th e r 
K in g A ve. S E , in th e heart of a predominately all black arca. “ I f s been hard to get m em b e rs in 
W ashington for the last 
IU or 15 years because of la rk in g and c rim e ,” said 
Allen B u rg er, a fo rm er go v ern o r of D.t - Lodge 

The Moose is the lifeblood o f the forest. 
He robs not his fellow man. He scales the heights, rising high. He crops the leaf of the water lily. He takes only what he needs. 

— W a lte r K etz, Past Suprem e G o v e rn o r, 
Loyal O rd e r o f the M o ose 

No. 
126. 
“ But the m em b ers want to keep the lodge th ere. It s a m a tte r of p ride m ore than anything else.” 
The Moose a ttra c ts a large, loyal following in sm aller cities and in su­ burban areas, especially in the Mideast. 
The Moose keeps costs and ritual hokus-pokus down to a minimum. The entire initiation and in­ doctrination ceremony is c ra m m e d into 37 m in ­ utes. A nnual dues at most lodges range from only $13 to $25. 
Its other selling points are two large complexes the 
Moose o p e ra te s 
M ooseheart, a “ city of children’’ near Aurora, 
111., that houses and edu­ cates orphaned 
Moose children; and Moosefia- veil. a r e tir e m e n t and nursin g home for aged 
Moose anil their widows near Jacksonville, Fla. 
Same 
Both w ere the b ra in ­ child of Jam es J. I)a\is, a U.S. S e n a to r from 
Pennsylvania, who built the organization, and was la te r indicted and a c ­ quitted of pro fiteerin g from 
Moose c h a rity balls, which the govern­ ment unsuccessfully al­ leged violated hitters statutes. 
Otherwise, the Moose isn t all that d ifferen t from a host of other fra- ternal and civie groups, m any w ith an im a l names: the Klks, the Ea­ gles, the 
Lions, the 
S h in ers, the Masons, the 
Woodmen of the World, etc. Many do pretty much w hat the Moose does.

But the Moose is edgy. 
W hen a reporter visited the m id w in te r c o n fe r­ ence of the M ary la n d , 
Delaware. District of Co­ lum bia Moose A ssocia­ tion recently, large beads of sweat appeared on the forehead of state director 
Harry Bergen. He barred the new sm an from all 
Moose meetings and said it would be im possible for him to grant an in- terview d u rin g the three-day conference.

Heilman, th** world s top 
Moose lie was admitted to one meeting where the only business was a de. m o n stratio n of m outh- to-m outh re su scita tio n techniques 

Kind 
W hat kind of people belong to the Moose? 
The hundreds of Moose men and women at the conference were the true b e lie v e rs. They were gray-haired and middle aged for the most part 
Many men wore leisure su its and the women were coiffed in beehive h a ird o e s. 
They were frien d ly people, quick with the handshake and sm ile, uneasy with the interv lew ors 

Allen B urger said lie met his wife. then a wi 
• iou. at the Moose E m ­ m a H ard esty, of E d g e­ mere. Md , said slit aud her husband joined the 
Moose I** years ago Hor 

 husbands mother, whom the couple had cared for for years, had just died after being bedridden for a decade. 
"We wanted to join so­ m eth in g , to get in ­ volved,’’ she recalled . 
“ We had no children and no real interest. Now I’m usually down at the lodge at least three nights a week. It's like a family lo us.” 

“ We’re all just ordin­ ary, w orking p e o p le ,” said Jam es M cFarland, 

61, a m e m b e r of 
Cumberland, Md.. Lodge 
914, for the last 35 years. 
“ We don’t have no rich people. We don’t have no real poor people. Guess most of us work at Ce- lanese, Pittsburgh Paint 
G lass, or Kelly-Spring- field P lan t in C u m b er­ land. 
Orphans 
Like alm o st every other Moose interviewed, he m entioned Moose* h e a rt and how the o r ­ phans of m e m b e rs are 

 cared for there free of charge. “ It’s a wonderful thing for a young family man to have,” he said. 
“ It s a darn cheap insur­ ance policy.” 
“ M ooseheart is the heartbeat of the Moose. 
You'll have to come there and v is it,” d e c la re d 
Moose director general 
Heilman. 

As a practical matter, how ever, the “ city of children,” located on an im p re ssiv e 1,1o9 a c re c am p u s 38 m iles from 
Chicago, pro v id es s e r ­ vice to a sm all popula­ tion. Its e n ro llm e n t is only 329. At the organi­ z a tio n ’s hom e for the aged. Moosehaven. is on­ ly

 fat could be dangerous 

By BILL HENDRICK 
A s s o c i a t e PRESS 

LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Here I am. In my prime, 29 years old, 6 feet 2, 177 pounds. I play racquetball at least two hours a week. I feel fine. Or so I thought. 
Until I took the ‘'stress 
................................................. test.” 
“You’re in the shape of a man 4o to 49 years old,” the doctor said. 
“ Y ou’re 
12 pounds overfat.” the other doctor said. 
And I felt it. 
Truth is. I’m not much different from the vast majority of A m ericans, they told me, and I can do something about it. 
The first step of the 
“ stre ss t e s t ” at the 
University of Louisville was to im m erse m e in water. I was told to sit in a chairlike contraption called a h yd rostatic w eigh in g d e v ise that d angles into a pool of water from a d ivin g board. 
The chair was attached to a w eighing scales. I was dipped into the water and told to make sure all of the air was out of my lungs. 
‘Squeeze’ 
“ Squ eeze it out. 
Squeeze it all out,” says 
Dr. Art Welt man, 27. who joined Dr. Bryant Stam ­ ford, 3(1, in research at the university last fall. 
The purpose of all of this was to determine my weight under w ater — w ith no air rn my lungs — so they could tell how much body fat I had Fat is less dense than water, and what 
I w eigh ed under w aler w as “ the amount other than the fa t,” said 
Stam ford. 
“ Essentially, the part of you that w as w eigh ed 
I under water was the lean body m ass.”

Everyone needs body fat. but not as much as most of us have. You can be a perfect sp ec im e n according to insurance com pany ch arts. You might weigh what you’re supposed to for >our height. But you still can be overfat 
After the water ordeal, electrodes were attached to me and I was forced to walk, then run, on a treadmill. When I got off the treadmill, I mounted a stationary bicycle and pumped the pedals until I was panting with e x ­ haustion and sw eatin g profusely. Ail the while, I had a snork le tit m> mouth lo make it even more difficult to breathe, a clamp was placed over my nostrils. 
'I’he snorkle was a t ’ tal lied to a m achine, a gasom eter, to m easure how much oxygen is ta­ ken in and how much is breathed out 
It was ail reg istered on s o p h is ­ ticated equipm ent that 
Plinked anil counted and changed colors 
Electrodes 

I he e lec tr o d e s we n attached lo an e l e c ­ trocardiogram m achine 
— used to detect abner mal heart activttv 
The purpose of all of 
; this was to make mc ex­ ert myself — to make my heart beat la ste r than i norma!

U M * U I \ it I 
I h i 

Everyone needs b o d y f a t, but not os much as most o f us have 

 w hat the doctors told me. 
My prescription; Self discipline. Walk 3(1 min­ utes, at least, every day, at a pace of four miles an hour. That’s not running. 
It s walking briskly. No p ills, no crash d iet. I wasn’t even told to quit smoking, although they said smoking is harmful 
“ But I play bull once a w e e k ,” 
I p rotested . 
Stamford said that’s not enough. To be fit, be said, you ’ve got to cut right and exercise* every day, or at least tour or five times a week. 
Walk 
In my case, I can lose one pound of body fat every’ two weeks if I take a brisk, 3o-minuto walk every day. But to stay in shape. I’ll have to kecp.it up. 
“ W e’re not se llin g a product 
(h a t’s very p a la ta b le ,’ 
S tam ford said. “ We’re lit mg in a soft society. We wouldn't have any trouble if sex and eating chocolate cake were good exercises.” 
E xercise won’t n eces­ sarily add years to your life, the two e x e r c ise physiologists say, but ll will improve the quality of your existence. 
By tile time most peo­ ple reach the age of IK. 
“ intellectual prowess is m ore im portant than p hysical p r o w e s s ,” 
Stamford says. “ People achieve status by making a lot of money. Having a good strong body loses it*. importance.” 
But Stamford s a y s all of that is beginning lo change, although people tend to think of what they do to keep in shape, not what they don’t do 
“ When people envision themselves as active, you say ‘y o u ’re in terrib le shape’ and they don't be­ lieve you. 
“ We are most success­ ful with people who come to us and say, ‘I'm a slob, 
I need help ’ ”

Phi Beta 
Kappas are the academic elite 

ASSOCIATED PBESS 

WASHINGTON — Barely six months after the founding of this country, dedicated to the propo­ sition that all men are created equal, there was born a smaller society dedicated to the propo­ sition that some are not. lf the United States of America is the log cabin of egalitarianism , then Phi 
Beta Kappa is the castle of the educa­ tionally elite. 
Today, some 2oo years later, both are stronger than ever. Both have grown up with their conflicting philosophies in a kind of sy m b io sis, not alw ays peaceful but at least abiding. 
Luminaries 
Yet the Phi Beta Kappa key is woven into A m erican h isto ry , worn by 13 presidents, the first chief justice of the 
Supreme Court, and brigades of poets, p o liticia n s, w r ite rs , p h ilo so p h e rs, educators and inventors — from Ralph 
Waldo Emerson to Eli Whitney, from 
Mark Twain to Mark Hopkins, from 
O liv er W endell H olm es to N elson 
Rockefeller. 
Today, six of the nine Supreme Court justices are Phi Betes, IO U.S. Sena­ tors, some 28 representatives, Federal 
R e se rv e B oard C h a ir m a n A rth u r 

Burns. Librarian of Congress Daniel 
B o o r s tin , and such lu m in a r ie s as 
Henry Kissinger and George Bush. 
Today, too, the national honor socie­ ty seems to have weathered the activist sto rm of the 198os when s tu d e n ts seemed to run the colleges, an era of inflated g ra d e s, p a ss-fail m a rk in g , watered-down courses, weakened de­ gree requirements, a rising distrust of intelligence and the tests that purport to measure it. 
It grew, says Dr. Kenneth G reen , executive secretary of the society, out of a thrust for equality and the notion that everybody is entitled to a college ed u cation — a p ro p o sitio n no one would quarrel with. 
" B u t,” Dr. Green says, " i t doesn’t negate the fact that some will perform better than others, contribute more to the world than o th e rs. T h e r e s till should be a means of encouraging ex­ cellence.” 
And that. Phi Beta Kappa says, is what it’s all about. 
Secret 
The society was born in secret at the 
College of William and Mary in W il­ lia m s b u rg , V a ., on D ec. 5, 1778, dedicated to discussion and d eb a te , fraternity and the “ encouragement of any new invention of 
A rts and 
S c ie n c e s .” It first m et in the Old 
Raleigh Tavern, and Law Nine of its constitution warned that " t h e least appearance of intoxication or disorder of any single member by liquor’’ was subject to a fine of IO shillings. 
The society spread to Harvard and 
Yale and other institutions in the bud­ ding nation, probably saving its life since the College of William and Mary closed for a time in 178o in the face of an approaching British force. 
Phi Beta Kappa’s primary concerns 
An honor roll 

The list of distinguished Phi Beta Kappas is long and varied. Besides Ralph 
Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes, virtually every important early 
American writer was a Phi Bete—Washington Irving. William Cullen Bryant. 
John Greenleaf W hittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Jam es Russell 
Lowell. 
Add to the list such famous American names as John Hay, Daniel Webster. 
Samuel F. B. Morse, Edward Everett. 
Or Presidents from John Quincy Adams lo Grover Cleveland, from 
Woodrow' Wilson to Calvin Coolidge, from Teddy Roosevelt to Franklin 
Roosevelt. 
On the current Supreme Court, count Henry Blackmun, Lewis F . Powell, 
William H. Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Potter Stewart and Byron White. 
And three generations of Rockefellers are represented—John D. Jr., Nelson and Rodman. 

 today arc more subtle threats to the 
Republic, notably what it sees as the enemies of academic excellence. 
“ I see grade inflation as a symptom of weakening stand ard s," Dr. Green notes. 
“ During the ’8os, when student a c ­ tivism was at its height and faculties were inclined to be sym pathetic gen­ erally to demands for relevant or so­ called relevant studies, they were also sympathetic to young men who would be eligible for the draft and Vietnam if they didn’t stay in college." 
Easier 

This led, he says, to wholesaling A’s and B ’s and dropping difficult studies such as foreign languages and m ath ­ ematics as prerequisites for degrees. 
“ I’m happy to see,” says Dr. Green, 
"th at the professors and a d m in istra­ tors are a sse rtin g th e m se lv e s once again, and saying in effect that we do know more about what should consti­ tute an education than the stud ents do.” 
In more and m ore c a s e s , colleges 

 and universities are tightening degree requirem ents by reinstating m an d a ­ tory stu d ies such as th e n a tu ra l scien ces, and there is an increased emphasis on writing. 
So Phi Beta Kappa, as protector of excellence, seem s in the 197os to be getting its way. But only a decade ago, some students elected to the society refu sed to jo in , the s c h o la s tic equivalent of turning down an Oscar 
Some have reconsidered and sought admission, with limited success. " I t ’s really up to the chapters,” says Green. 
Small 
A lm ost 379,ooo people have been elected to m em bership, and since it started small and grew to its present stature in this century, about 325,ooo are still alive. 
Perhaps more important in term s of standards is the fact that th ere are only 214 Phi Bete chapters among the nation’s 1.-914 four-year colleges and universities. 
Phi Beta Kappa remains dedicated to its G re e k in itia ls s ta n d in g for 
" P h ilo s o p h ia Bion K u b e r n e te s ” — 
"Love of wisdom — the helmsman of life.” 
It abandoned secrecy long ago. and in 1875 admitted women to m e m b e r­ ship. Its last president. Jo h n Hope 
Franklin, was the first black to serve in that capacity. He is a distinguished professor of history from the Univer­ sity of Chicago. 
Most chapters have a great deal of autonom y, c r e a tin g v aried r e q u i r ­ ements for election. In any case, i f s not easy. Each chapter decides how far down the grade rankings it will reach for candidates. It might be the top IO per cent of a class. It might be the top three per cent. But grades are not the only criterion. Members will review the courses a student earned those grades in, measure the breadth of study, the degree of interest. Often a candidate is known to a faculty m em ber who is a 
Phi Bete. 
Standards 
By upholding these standards, the society hopes to influence the general level elf a liberal education. 

"W e ’ve run into trouble making dis­ tinctions occasionally,” Dr. Green ad­ mits. " I s a m ajor in dance considered as qualified as someone engaged in a liberal subject? We don’t have all the say since we are a loose confederation. 
But we specify that those studies which are professional or technical in nature are excluded." 
In any case, there is a great deal of 

 agonizing over who should be elected. 
Who, then, is the ideal Phi Bete? 
Dr. G re e n ta k e s p au se in the gracious old townhouse that serves as 
Phi B ete’s headquarters in W ashing­ ton. 
“ Someone who took the best kind of edu cation as tra in in g for life , not necessarily for the love of study itself, but because of a need for increased perception. The honest and e a rn e st study of 
E n g lis h or h is to ry or chemistry or biology or physics as a way of enlarging the mind or ju d g ­ m ent. S om eo n e who would id ea lly make the kind of citizen who could contribute to the kind of world we all hope for.” 
But surely there is a flaw in this noble breed? Surely som e Phi B ete once ran amok. Is there an Aaron Burr or a Benedict Arnold in the society’s closet? 
" I ’m sure there are so m e," he said, pondering. “ I just honestly don’t know. 
It's never been talked about here, and there’s no reason it wouldn’t be. office gossip being what it is. 
"B u t the chances are, if they did run amok, they were probably not distin­ guished enough to draw attention to 

 th e m s e lv e s . I'm su re th a t not all m em bers of Phi Beta Kappa realize the potential that one would hope for them. But I can't give you the name ol 
Al Capone or anyone like that.”

Swim hopes dampened 

Som e helpful hints for Gilbert Salinas 

Next week the scales begin to balance for the parents of Gilbert 
Salinas, the tall and handsome boy from Burbank high. It's both difficult and expensive keeping a kid in kicks and threads when the kid stands just a nip under seven feet. 
You’d be surprised at the number of shoe stores that don't carry size 16 triple A footwear. You might also be jolted by the price tags used by those that do. 

Those extra expenses for the past six years, however, will soon seem small because a whole gang of people are beginning to line up to offer Gilbert free educations, complete with room and board and all the basketballs he can stuff. 

T here’s never been a basketball player in this city’s history with so many offers from so many colleges. \ s a matter of fact, Salinas might w ind up topping Warren McVea’s volumn on football offers made him in 1964. The one-time Brackenridge flash counted 
84 bonifide college proposals before settling on the University of Houston. 

In the days to come, unless Gilbert has already m ade up his mind and signs in great hhste, the youngster will be flooded with assorted advice from friends and well-wishers. 

This isn’t to add to any confusion that he might already be harboring but a few tips that could be helpful shall now be p re se n te d to G ilb e rt. No charge. .lust an extra little service from old dad here. 

First off, as a solid B student, pick a school that's strong in the subjects you prefer. Secondly, pick a city or area that you’re almost sure you'll be happy wit* for the next four years. That’s all. 
No more to it than that and don't let anyone tell you any differently. 

You see, some hotshot coaches will argue that Salinas should attend a hotshot basketball college that p ro­ m ises to challenge for the national championship. He should, they'll say, if he hdpes to someday play pro ball. 
You know, play on a national contender, get m ore publicity and you'll go higher in the pro draft. 

That kind of salesm anship m ight hold some truth and be okay for many but it won’t hold air where seven-foot candidates are concerned. The excep­ tionally big guys have a tremendous advantage in that respect because there isn’t a pro scout, coach or com­ petent office hand who doesn't know where every seven-foot player in the nation is attending school. 

And they won’t need some sportsw­ riter or radio reporter to provide them with the monthly progress of each tall player. 

The UCLA way 

It s no secret that UCLA stands far above the rest of the pack in grinding out national championships. And it s almost public knowledge that UCLA scouts are in pursuit of Salinas. 

But if I were (filbert I'd look to past perform ances, the track records of other tall men who starred at UCLA. 
They might look great to som e but from here it appears that they lea\e that school with unusual attitudes, to say the least. 

John Wooden is hailed as the grea­ test collegiate basketball coach in the game’s history but in March of '74 he was a rather pathetic tigure in the na*

By CLIFFORD BROYLES 
OF THE EXPRESS NEWS STAFF 

San Antonio’s hopes for a high finish in next w eekend’s UIL state swimming championships may have been sunk by an ul­ tra-tough regional meet. 

That is the opinion of John Ryan, aquatics director for the North East 
Independent School District. 
“ A lot of potential state cham pion­ ship points knocked off each other at the regionals,” said Ryan. 
“ In m any regions T h e re a re six statewide) our third, fourth and fifth 
Pan Ani 
Hefters prevail 

LAREDO (AP) - Pan 
American won its second straig h t Border O lym ­ pics tennis tournament 
Saturday behind the all- around play of 
John 
Picken. 
The Broncs scored 42 points to beat Mary Har- din-Baylor with 25, fol­ lowed by North Texas 21, 
Houston Baptist 9 and 
Monterrey Tech 6. 
Picken, of Vancouver, 
Canada, beat Gary Olsen of North Texas 6-4, 6-2 for the singles title while the 
Broncs’ Ricardo Eynaudi and Rob Hubbard won the doubles over team ­ m ates Scan Sorrensen and Picken. 

 best Umes would be better than their top two,” said Ryan. “ So in a lot of e a sie r regions, som e te a m s m ay qualify a lot more people.” 
Ryan pointed out that both Houston and Dallas schools are divided into two separate regions. 
Three of the schools under R yan’s juridiction Althougk each has its own coach), M acA rthur, Roosevelt and 
Churchill, ranked 1-1-3 in last week's 
Region VI competition in the girls division. 
Alamo H eights, coached by P ete 
Williams, and Churchill fought to a 1-2 finish in the boys division. 
Williams favors a push to allow more than the top two regional finishers to 

 compete at state. 
Preliminaries in the state meet will be at 6:3o p.m. Friday at the new Texas 
Olympic Swimming Center in Austin.* 
Finals are set for 2 p.m. Saturday. 
San Antonio’s state qualifiers proved their mettle in regional by ranking 1-2 among all regional qualifiers in three girls events and will have favorites in six events plus both relays. 
Ryan looks at the boys b a ttle betw een 
H eights and 
C h u rch ill 
(Heights won (68-61 Vi a1 regional), as 
“ a real dogfight.” 
Churchill and Heights have s tru g ­ gled for local supremacy on just about every front they have met. Heightsm beat Churchill in two major meets and 

 a dual meed. while Churchill held the edge at the spring Coaches Association swim meet. 
Churchill’s girls can’t be counted out since they won the Coaches Association spring meet and Marshall, which was fifth at regional, has the individual talents of Laura Rudwick to fall back on. 
San Antonio’s other top entries in­ clude these regional winners:

 tional meet. John wasn't coaching Bill 
Walton and that crew . Nobody was. 

UCLA had won seven straight na­ tional crowns so the Walton gang felt that it was rather degrading to show up for a third place contest against Kan­ sas. North Carolina State stunned the favored Uclans in the semifinals and word reached Wooden that his players 
‘ probably wouldn’t bother to show up for the third place encounter.” 

After a long hassle, much debate and a high degree of suspense, the UCLA team strolled into the arena about 3o minutes before post-time. When it was over Wooden said, “ I'm delighted that all my players were here and wanted to play.’’ That had to be the strangest statement ever to roll from a coach's mouth. 

But Walton wasn't alone as a UCLA oddball. Lew Alemdor also developed some unusual thoughts and habits after enrolling at UCLA. For the better part of two seasons reporters had to spend 3o minutes talking religion with 
Hareem Abdul-Jabbar in order to slip in three minutes worth of basketball conversation 

Hard enough 

I he whole point is. it must be diffi­ cult enough for a young man to keep a level head when that head stays a foot or so higher than anyone else’s he en­ counters daily. 

From what I hear. Gilbert has man­ aged exceptionally well to this point and his future is about as bright as any high school youth could expect. 

The whole point of this piece is to convince Salinas that he should listen politely but snub the pressures of re­ cruiters. weigh all sides carefully and then make up his own mind. 

Not too many things pay better in the long run hut there s a whole lot more to life than stuffing a basketball through a hoop. 

 rwT 
I igers split 

John Kaufman drove in three runs with a triple and a single Saturday to spark Trinity to a 6-3 win over Abilene Christian and a split over their doubleheader. 
ACU won the first game, 6-4, in nine innings by scoring a pair of un­ earned runs in the top of the ninth. The game was scheduled for seven innings. 
Trinity got off to a 3-1 lead after an inning in the nightcap when Kauf­ man drove in Carl Theis and Hector Rodriguez w ith his triple and Sergio 
Trevino’s hit scored 
Kaufman. 
K aufm an and 
Ro driguez singled home two more Tiger run in the sixth. 
Trinity, which is now 
5-9 on the year, will play 
Rice in Houston at I p.rn 
Monday.

Benavides, Korus in V ailing game’ 

Luis Benavides and Kathleen Korus are waiting patiently for the official results of the Southwest Texas Junior Bowling Association’s tournament. 
Benavides and Miss Korus, both bowling way above their averages, unofficially won the overall boys’ and girls’ scratch all event titles, respectively, during the recently completed SVVTJBA meet at Goliad. 
Benavides had 1,756 scratch while bowling in Class A, and Miss 
Korus bad 1.638 scratch and 2,o69 handicap in Class B to lead the field in both categories. 
Ann Elley, the tournament director, said that it’ll take a week or two to have the official results. She also said that 2,784 y o u n g ste rs en te red the event, including a record 216 teams, 
852 singles, and 426 doubles. 
“ I was rolling the ball real good and 
I had a couple of lucky breaks,” said 
Benavides, a 17-year old jun io r at 
Highlands High School. ‘‘I had only one low game. 
“ I’ve been waiting a long time for this. I practiced a lot for this tourna­ ment. I practiced 2o or 3o games the week before the tournam ent, and. I guess, it paid off.” 
Benavides, who has a 169 average, rolled a 584 series in the team event, 
641 in doubles, and 531 in singles. He averaged 195 for the tournament, and that included a 261 game. 
“ I was bowling with a new Randolph 
Classic ball — a Silver Bullet — and it really helped,” Benavides said. “ I got this ball about a month before the tournament, and I had been practicing with it before the meet." 
Miss K orus, a 15-year old Sam 
Houston sophomore, had a 182 average for the tournament. She carries a 15o average in league play. She had the best Class B singles handicap score with 725, and teamed with Melissa 
Sehrank for doubles honors with 1.323. 
*T d o n ’t know what h a p p e n e d ,” 
Kathleen said. “ I just got a good streak of luck. It was fun, and I’m glad I did well.” 
She scored 487 in the team event, 579 in doubles, and 572 in singles. Kathleen had one game below 15o — a 134 in the team event — while rolling such scores as 212, 21o, 192, and 184. 
“ I didn't have any idea that I would bowl this well,” Kathleen said. " I f s a great feeling.” 
John Wetz won Class A handicap all events with 1.969 — six pins over Ben­ avides, while Julie Roba won Class A handicap with 1.884. Class A doubles handicap winners were Bobby Herrera and Robert X. Hernandez with 1,328. but Alexa Norman and Jimmy Bur­ dick beat that score by one pin in Class 
C. Craig Titus (722) in Class D and 
Joanna Pinkston (739) in Class D and the best overall handicap scores in their division. Titus had 2,o36 for all events. 
Jeannine Schaack won the Class A girls’ handicap singles with 635. and 
Joe Bennett took the same honor in 
Gas* A boys’ singles with a 7o5. Black 
Sabbath won the Class A team ham* dicap event with 3,o24. but Bowlerama 
Ferocious Bowlers had the best han­ dicap score with 3,126 in Class B.

Johnny Neumann: 
Rebel with a cause 

By KEVIN O K EEFF E 
O * THE E X m S S - N E W S STAFP 
Johnny Neumann's easy-going manners belie his stormy past. 
Neumann, now plying his basketball trade with the Los Angeles 
Lakers, is relaxed. He jokes with teammates, cajoling them throughout practice and daring them to play some “Horse” afterwards. 
“This is a good situation,” Neumann said. “ I am with a good team and playing with the big fella (Lakers’ 7-2 center Hareem 
Abdul-Jabbar) is great. 
“ Heck, if we stay healthy, we should be in this thing all the way.” 
Times haven't always been sn good. 
J lie Memphis native elected to turn pflhfessional after his sophomore year at'Mississippi. Ile was the top college scorer that year, averaging more than 
4o p o i n t i e r game for the Rebels. 
The All-American guard scored HT points in one game and had more than ah points in five different games. His 
923 points during that sophomore sea­ son is still a record at Mississippi. 
Ile joined tilt' Memphis Pros in 1971 and remained in that old ABA town for two seasons. Oh, his scoring a v erag e dropped, but his pen­ chant for shooting did not. 
The 6-6 2oo-pounder tossed up 1,2oo shots in ‘71 and 1,232 in ‘72. That is when some of the problems started. He got a reputation as a ball-hog, always needing to jack up one more shot 
He began the next season iii Mem­ phis, but was traded to Utah in J a n ­ uary. He started the following season in Virginia, but wound up in Indiana. 
In 1975. it was back to Virginia, but only for a short time. He was shipped to Kentucky for the remainder of the

Neumann opened this season in Buf­ falo. reunited with Kentucky owner

But he was suspended and then traded. 
In te rm in g le d with his voyage through the ABA was a divorce to his wife, whom he had married during his college days. He also filed for bank­ ruptcy. an issue which still has not boon settled. 
“ I have nothing to say about all 

 that," he stated not-so-calmly. after claiming that most of his past prob­ lems have been misconstrued. 
“ It is .inst a bunch of BS. They talk about my maturity and the rest, i have gotten a bud rap. Just ask the people in 
LA., they will tell you.” 
“John has been nothing but a model citizen since co m in g out h e r e ,”

D eB usschere claim s 
Netts owe him $ 4 o o ,o o o 

MINEOLA. N.Y. (AP) — Dave DeBusschere, former general manager of the New York Nets, has filed suit in State Supreme 
Court against the team and its principal owner, Roy Boo. for 
$4oo.IMM) he claims the Nets owe him 
DeBusschere served in the former American Basketball 
Associaton club’s front office for one year of a 1o-year, 
$l-million contract before leaving in 1975 to take over as ABA commissioner. 
He helped arrange the m erger of the ABA with the National 
Basketball Association. 
According to DeBusschere’s suit, he signed a settlement with 
Boe last November for the rem aining nine years of the contract. The terms called for the former New York Knicks* star to be* paid $5o,(MMI a year for eight years starting Jan 13 
DeBusschere said the first payment was not made, making 
Boe and the Nets liable for the total settlement. 
Bin* dec lined c omment on the suit. A hearing is scheduled for 
March 25 on the matter. 

 and he helped us win some big games down the stretch. 
“ I think if you spell it out for John, everything is okay. So many tim es, coaches will take another one’s word on a guy. And that is how things get started.’’ 
“ You know, anybody else in the NBA can get divorced and no one cares,” 
Neumann said. “ But when it happens to me, I ain on page one. I make good copy. 
“ That bankruptcy thing still is not finalized. The divorce cost me sn much that I had to file. But I have no money problems. In fact. I am financially se­ cure.” 
N eumann, a 24-year-old, signed a 
1o-year contract with John Y. Brown last year. 
“ ll made mc feel great that John Y. had that much faith in m e,” Neumann said. 
In Buffalo, Neumann was suspended for “ conduct detrimental to the fran­ chise. 
“They had no reason to do that,” he said. “ That is why they took me off suspension quickly. They suspended me so they would not have to pay m e.” 
He said money was not even a con­ sideration when lie left Mississippi. 
Heart attack 
“ My father had a heart attack and that is why I left,’’ Neumann reported. 
“ But I tell you the thing that irks me about all the publicity — it just is not basketball. I know everybody likes to read it, though.” 
“There is something about the guy,” 
Albeck said, referring to N eumann. 
“ He is a funny kind of guy. He keeps everyone loose on the floor and in the clubhouse. 
“ I could not envision him doing an­ ubing troublesome. Now, of course, he is capable of going off the deep end, but no more so than anyone else.” 
“ I think John has m atured a lot. 
Remember, he was playing pro ball when In* was 19 That is awfully young. 
He has had a lot of experience in his 24 years.” 
Pleased 
Although Neumann wishes he could play m o re w ith the L a k e rs, he is pleased with the way things are. 
“ J e rry (L aker Head Coach West) tries to get IO guys in every gam e,” 
Neumann said. “ And in the backcourt, we have (Lucius) Allen, (Don) Chancy and (Bo) Lamar. That is a lot of ta­ lent.” 
“ He has bellied us iii some gam es this y e a r.” Albeck said. “ He is not afraid lo take the big shot. He thrives on pressure. 
“ I really think he is a m u ch -m a­ ligned guy.”

Nets’ Archibald is out for season 

UNIONDALE. N.Y. (AP) — Tiny Archibald of the 
New York Nets has been sidelined fur the rest of the 
| National Basketball Association season and his injured left foot h a s been p l a c e d iii a e a s t again 
Archibald, acquired from Kansas City in a pre­ season trade, broke a bone in the foot last .Jan 2 
The cast was removed about a month ago and 
Archibald had been working out in Kl Paso for about 
I two weeks, hoping the warm weather i i i the town where he attended college would speed the healing process. 
NBA q u ole-raek 

Kermit Washington of the Lakers on why he de­ cided to concentrate on basketball rather than foot­ ball after graduating from Calvin Coolidge High 
School in Washington D.C., where he played only one year of basketball: “ When I began playing basket­ ball, I started enjoying it more than football. Both the practices aud games were more fun and I didn’t have to play in all that bad weal lier " 

Aaron Ja m e s of the Jazz oil playing fur his bome-town team (New Orleans); “ Playing in my hometown takes the pressure off I know where to stay, how lo get around and I’m in fam iliar su r­ roundings. AU my family except one sister lives here and H’s good to know that they can watch m e." 

Kevin Luughery. coach of the N ets, on E arl 
Monroe of the Knicks: “The most exciting player I’d ever seen until Ju liu s E rv in g ,” Adds Loughery. 
“ There are many players who don't want the ball lu te iii a close g a m e . Good players want the ball and 
Earl has a l w a y s been like that, lie s a great one- on-one player inn when he came to the Knicks in* adjusted to their style Only great players eau adjust lo a different style without arty loss in skill and you st*e what Earl has done.”

It is quite possible we are witnessing the greatest season of accuracy by a guard in the 31-year history of the National 
Basketball Association. The Iceman has been that good. 
With 1H games left in the regular season, the Spurs’ George 
Gervin has hit 58o of 1,o67 shots from the field, good for a .544 percentage. If the season ended today, it would be the second best field goal percentage ever recorded by a guard. 
The highest single season percen­ tage compiled by a backcourt man was during the 1972-73 campaign when the 
K ansas C ity-O m aha K in g s’ M atty 
Guokas shot .57o from the field. Never before and n ever afte r did the fi-6 
Guokas shoot 5o per cent from the field. 
To put Guokas’ season into perspec­ tive, you m ust first consider he took but 565 shots, only five above the m in­ imum necessary to be listed among the official field goal percentage leaders. 
By the end of this season, Gervin w ill have taken approximately 2Vz times as many shots as Guokas. 
Secondly, Guokas played next to 
Nato Archibald in the Kings’ backcourt during Tiny’s finest statistical season. 
A rchibald led the NBA in scorin g 
(34.9) and assists (11.4), so it is likely he received som e special attention from rival defenses, thus freeing Guo­ kas. Guokas averaged 9.1 points that year. 
Leading scorer 
Gervin, on the other hand, is his team’s leading scorer, the Spur most likely to draw special considerations from the opposition. He is loth in the 
NBA with a 23-point average. Gervin has played in all 66 Spur gam es this season, and has been in double figures every time. 
Wilt Chamberlain became the first 
NBA player to shoot over 5o per cent 
(.5o9) in 196o-61, and the Cincinnati 
Royals’ Oscar Robertson became the first guard to do it in 1962-63 (.518). 
Since then, 5o per cent performances have become increasingly common. l.qst season, for instance, all players ranked in the top IO in field goal per­ centage were over .5oo. 
Only four guards have shot 53 per cent or better for a season, and Ice has the opportunity to become the fifth. 
M ilw aukee’s Jon McGlocklin did it twice. In 197o-71, the B ucks’ c h a m ­ pionship season, McGlocklin shot .535, and in 1969-7o, he hit .53o. 
During those two seasons, McGlock­ lin a v e ra g e d 15.8 (7o-71) and 17.6 
(69-7o). He had better range than lee possesses, but Gervin, who goes to the basket so regularly and so well, has been a much more frequent visitor to the free throw line. and so his point production is significantly better than 
McGlocklin s. 
Hudson* Snyder 
T e only other guards to shoot so well were Atlanta’s Lou Hudson, who sank 
.531 of his shots during the 1969-7o season, and Seattle’s Dic k Snyder, who shot the same figure in 7o-71. However, 
Hudson swung regularly from guard to forward that season. After playing the first seven games of the season at for­ ward, Gervin has been at guard almost exclusively'. 
The m a jo r rea so n s for G e rv in 's spectacular shooting are threefold. 
First, of course, is the fact his shooting touch is softer than a baby’s behind. 
And. too, tilt' 6-7 Iceman has taken ad­ vantage of his height, hacking smaller guards iii close to the hoop. 
Secondly, he has an amazing variety of shots. Just when you think Ice is out of room and out of moves, he comes up with a fresh one. He has more shooting positions than Howard Johnson’s has 

 flavors. 
T hird, he has shown re m a rk a b le discretion for a player of his scoring prowess. Rarely does he take an ill­ advised shot. Gervin’s last season in tile ABA was his first over 5o per cent 
(.51o). His patience may be the biggest factor behind his improved shooting percentage this season. 
When Gervin, Indiana’s Billy Knight and Denver’s David Thompson moved to guard this season, the era of the Big 
G uard seem ed to be u n d e r way. 
Thompson is 6-3^, but “ plays ta ll” because of his leaping ability. Nuggets 
Coach Larry Brown apparently found him more valuable up front, since he has been moved back to forward. 
When the P a c e r s a c q u ire d John 
W illiam son, the se lf-p ro c la im e d 
“ Super Joh n,” the 6-6 Knight was a forward once again. Of the three, only the Iceman remains in the land of the little people. Spurs Coach Doug Moo says Ice will not play forward again, except in an extreme pinch. 
And why not? You wouldn’t m ake 
Tom Suaver a catcher, would you? 
Bits and pieces 
B iggest tro ub le in P h ila d e lp h ia , some say, is not Ju liu s Erving and 
George McGinnis playing together, but the selfishness of guard Lloyd Free, who is. p erh ap s, th e least bashful gunner in the NBA. And the competi­ tion is stiff for that title . . . 
A Detroit Piston release recently noted this has been one of Bob Lanier’s healthiest seasons. Ten days later. 
Lanier went out with a fractured bone in his right hand. Alabama rookie Leon 
Douglas has been starting in his place . 
Through Thursday nigh t’s gam es, the home teams have won 69 per cent 
(496-223) of the time, down from 75 per cent earlier in the season. Seems like the c on ten ding te a m s a re w inning everywhere now that everyone knows where the line to the playoffs starts . . . 
So far the trade which sent guard 
Tom Henderson to W ashington and forward Leonard “ Truck” Robinson to 
Washington has worked out well for both teams. Bullets Coach Dick Motta now has Ins playmaker, and the Hawks have a pair of exceptional forwards in 
Robinson, once a Spur draft pick, and 
John Drew. 
But in the long run, the Hawks will prosper m ost. “ I liked H enderson. don’t get me w ro n g ,’’ says Hawks 
General M anager Mike Storen, “ but any time you have the chance to get a good big man for a good little man, you lake it.” The availability of guards and the scarcity of forwards on the trading blocks around the league earlier in the season proves that

BEN MCKOWN 
. . . tough stops 
SMU 

By KEVIN O K EE FFE 
OF THE EXPRESS NEWS STAFF 

Trinity ca p tu red fiv e of six s in g le s matches before going blank in the doubles, and managed a 5-4 dual match tennis vic­ tory over Southern Methodist Saturday at the Trinity Tennis Stadium. 

A capacity crowd looked on as the top-ranked 
Tigers im proved their season m ark to 12-3 and avenged a loss to SMU two weeks ago in the finals of the Corpus Christi Invitational. The loss was just the second of the year for the M ustangs against six victories. 
Ben McKown captured the featured singles fray over Jai DiLouie, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. Tony G iam m alva grabbed the number two match against Chris De­ laney 7-6 (5-4), 6-4. barry Gottfried and Erick Iskersky barely worked up a sweat in winning number three and four, re­ spectively. Gottfried downed Mark Turpin. 6-3, 6-1, and Iskersky, who lost the first two games of the first set, beat David Bohrnstedt, 6-2, 6-1. 
Mike Davidson, playing in the No. 6 spot, took the clincher, beating Mark Vines, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. Dave 
Benson was the lone TU loser. He dropped a 6-4. 6-3 decision to Pern Guerry. 
In number one doubles, Bohrnstedt and Delaney edged Trinity’s G-Men, Gottfried and Giammalva, 
3*6, 6-3, 7-5. McKown and Iskersky lost the No. 2 match to DiLouie and Turpin, 7-6,6-3; and Vines and 
Guerry drubbed Davidson and Neal Wade, 6-o, 6-2. 
Letdown 
‘ There was a letdown in doubles, no doubt about it,” Trinity Coach Bobby McKinley said. “ We have played five team s in the top ten this season and our guys have been psyched up so much, it was tough. 
“ I believe if we had to have one of the doubles for 
(he match, we would have won. We played number one and two pretty close. I don’t feel badly at all.” 
But long before the doubles, McKown and DiLouie staged the day’s most exciting match. 
The two struggled on a windy, dusty day for nearly two hours. However, most of that tim e was con­ sumed in just the second point of the match when they hit 48 groundstrokes before DiLouie won the endurance trial. 
The baseline war lasted only until the fifth game of the first set when DiLouie began attacking. But 
McKown was able to use some deft volleys to pass the curly-haired, Dallas freshman and take the first set. breaking serve on the deciding game. 
McKown and DiLouie both went to the net often in the second set. They each traded passing shots down the line, as well as trading service breaks, four in the set. 
Opponents 

DiLouie, as opponents are won t to do at Trinity, drew the crowd’s wrath when he called a McKown lob long. Following a five-minute discussion, play resumed — DiLouie’s point. 
McKown broke serve in the third game of the third set, but DiLouie broke right back, coming from two 
[joints down to take the game. DiLouie won his serve and then broke McKown again, going ahead 4-2 in the set. 
But McKown kept the pressure on, going to net and forcing DiLouie into some errors as the SMU star tried desperately to pass. And, in the final game, McKown slapped a crosscourt shot down the line. DiLouie stared, but called it good. The match ended when a DiLouie groundstroke sailed past the baseline. 
Nastase falls to Rosewall 

LAKEWAY (A P)—Veteran Ken Rosewall of Aus­ tralia survived strength-sapping baseline rallies and scored heavily on volley winners at the net Saturday to stun favored Hie Nastase of Romania 6-3, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the $2oo,ooo Tournament of Cham­ pions. 
American Eddie Dibbs pinned Vijay Amritraj of 
India to the baseline with deep, spinning ground­ strokes to take the other quarterfinal match 6-5, 6-3. 
Dibbs won the first set tiebreaker 7-4. The tie­ breaker was decided ut 5*all for the benefit of television.

 notches ahead of his partner in crime, forward 
Inirry Kenon, who has the second most steals among league forwards. 
Only Denver’s Bobby Jones has more. 
“ Our pressure style gives me a lot of op­ portunities for steals,” says Gale. “ We try and deny that first pass to the forwards. T h at’s when a lot of steals occur ” 
Spurs Couch Doug Moo ranks Gale the No. I defensive player on Ins learn And Gale is a steady offensive perform er who is eighth in the NBA with 5.7 assists a game Gale carries a IU.3 scoring average and is a 48 per cent shooter from medium range. 
“ I try to create situations by penetrating,” said Gale. “ I won’t try to force a shot. After all, K and lee are our big scorers. Bul I won t turn down an open shot, either.” 
Gale’s backcourt mute, George Gervin, is loth in the NBA in scoring, and he will tell you that few are as adept at getting the ball to him as Gale. 
’’I ’m very s a tisfie d with th e way I ’ve played,” says Gale. “ I think I ve played well in all aspects of the game I think I’ve made a contribution lo the t e a m ” 
Mike Gale lias a license to steal, and not even Commissioner Larry O’Brien can toke it away from him 

Spur shoos: l’lie Spurs who have nut lost iii twu weeks, will be going for their seventh straight victory and a 3*o season series sweep of the Pistons 
They will also be aiming for their seventh straight victory on CBS. They have yet to lose before the regional cameras

San Antonio EXPRESS-NEW S— Sunday March I 3 1977 
UTEP dethroned 

DETROIT (AP) - Washing­ ton State, led by Kenyan runner 
Henry Rono, beat defending champion Texas-El Paso by a half-point Saturday to capture the 13th National Collegiate 
Athletic Association indoor track and field championship. 

Rono set a meet record in the two- mile run and took a third in the mile, while teammate Joshua Kimeto, also a 
Kenyan, took third in the two-mile and 
Brian Worden tied for fourth in the 

 pole vault. 
The Cougars totaled 25Vfe points to 25 for Texas-El Paso, which was trying for its fourth consecutive NCAA title. 
The Miners got in an NCAA record high jump of 7 feet 31/* inches from 
Cireg Joy in the day’s last event. But it w asn’t enough. Joy, a C an adian , p assed the 7-3 m ark that Dwight 
Stones of Long Beach State set iast year. 
Third was Villanova with 21 points, followed by Illinois with 16, Kansas with 12V6, plus Auburn, Alabama and 
Oklahoma with IO each. 
Fifty-three team s scored in the 

 two-day event held at Coho Arena. 
Rono, a freshman who is the NCAA cross-country champion, covered the two miles in 8 minutes 24.83 seconds. 
That eclipsed the old record of 8.3o.91 set last year by Nick Rose of Western 
Kentucky. Western Kentucky’s Tony 
Staynings was runner-up in 8:32.47 and 
Kimeto was third in 8:38.31. 
T exas-El Paso won the d istan ce medley relay in a meet record 9:43.11 with the team of Fred Ongaga, Paul 
Njoroge, Frank Munune and Ja m e s 
Munyala, all of Kenya. 
The old record was 9:43.16, set by 
Texas-El Paso last year.

Andy 
Bean, seeking the first title of his two-year pro career, slipped to a one* under-par 71 but m an ­ aged to stretch his lead to three strokes Saturday in the th ird round of the 
Doral Open Golf 
Tournament. 
The hulking, 6-foot-4 
Bean, the leader all the way in this chase for a 
$4o,ooo first prize— more than he’s won in the rest of his c a re e r— put together a 54-hole total of 
2o5. l l -u n d er-p ar for three trip s over the tough. 7,o65-yard Blue 
M onster course at the 
Doral Country Club. 
Although he’s one of the tour’s longest hitters. 
Bean continued to let the par five holes escape. He hasn’t birdied one of the long holes since the 12th in T h u rs d ay’s opening 

 round and played them one over p ar—taking a bogey six on the 12th—on this warm, humid, part- ly-cloudy day. 
Leonard Thom pson, who’s been playing better since he abandoned a diet and regained the 
3o pounds he once lost, and 
Chi Chi Rodriguez moved into a tie for second place. 
Thompson had a wildly e rra tic round that in ­ cluded eight birdies, four bogeys, a double bogey and only six pars. He b ird ied seven of eig h t holes in the middle of the round on his way to a 7o and a 2o8 total, only three strokes back going into the final round Sunday, 
Bean’s 24th birthday. 
The tin y R odriguez matched the day’s best round with a brilliant 66 and took a share of the 
No. 2 spot. 

L a rry 
Z ie g le r, who owned second place alone going into the th ird round, was tied w ith 
Lanny W adkins, rookie 
M ike Sullivan and dan­ gerous 
Aussie 
D avid 
G raham , one of the w o rld ’s p re m ie r p e r­ formers last season, an­ other stroke back at 2o9 and very much in the chase. 
Wadkins, a runnerup in 
Los Angeles last month and on the rebound from a two-year slump, holed a seven iron shot for an eagle two, reeled off one string of five consecutive birdies and matched Ro- d rig u e z’ 
66. 
S u llivan closed up w ith a 68, 
G raham had a 69 and 
Ziegler slipped to a 73. 
Jack Nicolaus failed to make a major move and, w ith a 7o. was seven shots back at 212. He was tied with PGA champion 

Dave Stockton, also with a 7o. 
Bruce Lietzke, a two- tim e w inner this year, had a 68 and was at 214. 

D efending cham pion 
Hubert Green was 72-215. 
Johnny M iller blew to a 
74-22o and Masters king 
Ray Floyd was 77-221.

Stringing the stripers 

This 27-pound striped bass caught in Lake Texoma March 5 missed becoming the new state record by 5V2 ounces. The record, which was caught below Denison 
Dam in 
1 9 7 4 , weighed 2 7 pounds 
5 ounces. 
The 
27-pounder was caught on a white jig by Howard V. Hughes of 
Denison, who is holding the bass as it is being measured by Ken 
Wheeler. It was a yard long, 2Vi inches shorter than the record. 
Many area lakes have been stocked with stripers. In the photo at far right Ted Freeman of San 
Antonio shows off a I O-pound striper he caught at Lake Travis in 
February. The fish hit a yellow and black Hellbender in the main body of the

Walleye’s sex life 

KLEPPER 

This map of Canyon Lake and Guadalupe River access points was taken from the San Antonio area map the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
Department published recently for fishermen. The original map, which is available free from the department’s office on south Main, includes 
Medina, Braunig, Calaveras, Dunlap, McQueeney, Placid, Meadow, 
H-4 and H-5 Lakes in addition to Canyon, plus the Medina, San 
Marcos and Blanco Rivers in addition to the Guadalupe. 
Texas wildlife due federal tax m oney 

SPIC IAI TO THC IX H U S S N fW S 
AUSTIN - Of the $1o9.3 million total in federal funds being made available to the states for fish and wildlife resto ratio n , Texas is in line for 
$5,252,5oo. 
Federal aid funds are made availa­ ble to the states in two apportionments annually as tax receipts become avai­ lable at the U.S. Treasury Department. 
A preliminary apportionment of $47 million was made on July I, 1976, for fiscal year 
1977. 
The second apportionm ent in F eburary, 1977, amounted to an additional $62 million. 

A total of $1,242,5oo for fish restora­ tion and another $4,o1o,ooo in wildlife and hunter safety funds is available to 
Texas, the largest amount for any state. 
Funds for wildlife restoration and hunter safety programs come from an ll per cent excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition, a IO per cent tax on pistols and revolvers and an ll per cent tax on certain archery equipment. 

A IO per cent excise tax on fishing equipment supplies funds for fish res­ toration aid. 

By DAN KLEPPER 
OUTDOOR EDITOR 
If a person could be arrested for impersonating a fisherman, 
I would turn myself in to the nearest gendarme and plead nolo contendere to the judge. 

Results of a couple of recent fishing trips are prima facie evidence of my guilt. 

First, I went to Calaveras to catch a hybrid bass and caught a carp. Second, 
I went to Canyon to catch a walleye and caught zip. 
Actually, this space in the paper today was scheduled to contain photographs and an article of som ewhat questionable m erits entitled “How to Strip, a Walleye.” 
However, due to circumstances beyond my control, there are no photographs, as you can plainly see. 
But, since I am not one to miss an opportunity to exploit either sex or violence, I intend to proceed with the article in spite of the fact that I cannot illustrate it with graphic, lewd illus­ trations of the act. 
Porn 
Besides, I hate to spend four hours on the water on a cold March morning without getting any copy at all. 
The title of this article, therefore, will remain “How to Strip a Walleye.” lf I really wanted to give it a titillat­ ing title, I could call it “ How to Strip a 
Walleye With a F e a th e r,” but that more or less throws it into the qua­ druple X-rated category and the juris­ diction of the vice squad. 
The article remains, however, either hard core pornography or a liberal sex education, so you should govern your reading accordingly. 
Prude lf you are not the prudish type and have elected to continue your perusal of the article, pay close attention. 
The subject is som ewhat em b ar­ rassing even to me, so I am going to write real fast. 
My interest in the sex life of the walleye was aroused a few days ago when Parks and Wildlife Department fisheries biologist Jim m y Dean an­ nounced that the fish are about ready to spawn at Canyon Lake. 
Male walleyes, he said, have started concentrating in shallow water along 

S u n d a y Outdoors

 the dam, and the gonads of the fish are heavy with sperm-laden milt. 
They are waiting for the females, he continued, adding that he expected the two sexes to get together and do their thing the middle of last week. 
I was on hand for the mating meet­ ing. But it was a meeting that didn’t take place. All Dean and his crew caught in their nets were more males which were hanging around the dam like a bunch of high school lotharios at the senior prom. 
Empty 
Fourteen of the 33 males were sent alive to Heart of the Hills Research 
Station at Ingram, where they will do their hanging around in a tank, waiting for the females — if the girls ever show up 
The other males were dissected by the biologists, and Dean found so­ m ething quite interesting: The sto­ machs of all but two were devoid of food. Stomachs of two of the fish con­ tained only a few undigested bones. 
Do walleyes stop eating during the spawning period? An experiment with rod and reel indicates they m ight. 
Dean said fishermen tried fishing with everything from artificial lures to live minnows in the vicinity of the nets at the very time the walleyes were being caught in the traps and never got a strike. 
Why didn’t the females show up as expected last week? Dean theorizes that water tem peratures are still too cold. 
“ If the water temperature isn’t just 

 right, fertilization won’t take place even if both sexes are ready to spawn,” he said. 
I was disappointed in the nonap­ pearance of thb females last Wednes­ day, Dean was disappointed and the boy walleyes undoubtedly were disap­ pointed. 
Dean was all set. He had his special clay and his special feathers. That’s right, feathers. 
You see, in order to accomplish ar­ tificially what the fish can do natural­ ly, you’ve got to have a special feather from the wing of a big bird. 
It works like this: When a female walleye’s eggs are fully ripe, even a slight pressure on the abdomen of the fish will cause the eggs to be dis­ charged. Milt of the male fish also can be forced from the walleye in the same manner. This is called “ stripping.” 
If and when Dean is able to capture ripe males and females at the same time, he and members of his crew will strip eggs from the female into a tub, then strip milt from the males on top of the eggs. 
The feather, which apparently will not damage the delicate eggs, is used to stir the two together. 
Fertilization takes place within a 

 couple of minutes. During this period, the sperm invades the egg. 
Then the special clay is mixed with water and poured over the now-ferti­ lized eggs. Again they are stirred with the feather until the eggs are coated with clay. The special clay keeps the eggs from sticking together. 
Next step is washing. The eggs are placed in a washing basket and sub­ merged in the lake so that excess silt is removed. Then they are placed in a holding basket in the lake until the clay hardens. 
Series 
After that, the clay-coated eggs are extremely tough and durable and can withstand a considerable amount of rough trea tm e n t w hile being tra n ­ sported to hatcheries and transferred to hatching jars. 
Sooner or later the eggs hatch into tiny walleye fry which are little more 
Uian two eyeballs with egg sacs still attached. When they grow older, the fish will be used to stock public waters. 
At least, this is the plan. Dean and his crew will be back on Canyon this week to see if the finicky females put in an appearance in the traps. 
If they are late again, we might be able to develop the whole risq u e episode into a popular television series for late-night viewing which would ri­ val “ Mary’ Hartman, Mary Hartman.” 
I think it would be only right to honor the biologist who is in charge of the walleye project on Canyon to call the 
TV program “ Jim m y Dean, Jim m y 
Dean.”

Son Antonio EXPRESS-N EW S— 
Sunday March 13 1977 
Boxing card altered 
A new, 
1o-round semifinal bout has been added to the March 25 boxing card at Municipal 
Auditorium. 
Gilbert Galvan, of San 
Antonio, will face Augus­ tin Estrada of Juarez, 
Mexico, in the 1o-round semfinal fight. Original­ ly, Galvan was to face 
Esquiel Coronado of 
Mexico, but Coronado had to back out after the card was rescheduled three times. 
Promoter Tony Padilla said that all preliminary bouts would be changed because of fighters hav­ ing to back out due to previous committments. 
The 12-round main event has undefeated 
Mike Ayala of S.A. going against former world bantamweight champ 
Romero Anaya for the 
North American Boxing 
Federation super ban­ tamweight crown, cur­ rently owned by Ayala. 
Tickets are priced at $7 and $5. All ringside tick­ ets have been sold. 
Fights start at 8:3o p.m.

HOGSTON (AP) — The Rice Owls open spring football practice Tuesday arid filling the quarter­ back spot vacated by Tommy Kramer and building a team defense will be the main concerns of Coach 
Homer Rice. 
Rice said the quarterback spot is wide open with no successor in sight for Kramer, the NCAA passing champion and thle total offense leader._____________ 

NEW YORK (AP) - Having opened its show on the road for the first time ever, the 4oth annual 
National 
Invitation 
Tournament returns home to 
Madison Square Garden Mon­ day night for the quarter-finals. 

In an effort to boost attendance and save money, opening round games in the NIT were played at eight sites across the country last week. The eight survivors, including 12th-ranked 
Alabama—the only nationally ranked club in the field—will play the rest of the tournament here. 
Monday night’s double-header matches Alabama against Virginia 
Tech and Houston against Illinois 
State. Tuesday night’s quarter final pairings are Villanova against Massa­ chusetts and 
Oregon against 
St. 
Bonaventure. 
Monday night’s winners square off 
Thursday night in one semifinal con­ test and Tuesday night’s winners meet, also Thursday night, in the other. The finals are next Sunday. 

Alabama, sporting a 22-4 record, will be playing Virginia Tech, 19-9. for the second time this season. The Crimson 
Tide rolled over the Gobblers 1o8-78 in in id-December. The Tide w hipped 
Memphis State 8o-63 in the first round behind Reggie King's 26 points and a stiff defense. 
“ From what I’ve seen, the only team in the NIT that could touch Alabama might be Oregon,” said Memphis State 
Coach Wayne Yates. 
VMI made it into the Garden by downing Georgetown 83-79. 
Houston, behind high-scoring guard 
Otis Birdsong, slipped by Indiana State 
83-82 to advance to the quarters against 
Illinois State, a 65-58 winner over 
Creighton. 
Iii the other half of the draw, all the first round games were squeakers. 
Villanova got by Old Dominion 71-68; 
Massachusetts shaded Seton Hall 86-85 on a layup by Mark Donoghue with five seconds left; St. Bonaventure needed a basket by Glenn Hagan in the final seconds of overtime to beat Rutgers 
79-77, and Oregon survived a 65-point outburst by Anthony Roberts to edge 
Oral Roberts 9o-89.

HUTCHINSON, Kan. 
(AP) — Southern Idaho, the top-rated team in junior college basketball all season, has one na­ tional title tucked away and will be trying to match another one here this week. 
The Golden Eagles, 
31-o this year, have won 
48 straight games going into the week-long na­ tional junior college tournament starting 
Monday at the Hutichison 
Sports Arena Monday. 
The old record was 42. 
Now they’re trying to match the performance of only two other teams in junior college basket­ ball since the start of the tournament in 
1948—successive cham­ pionships. Moberly. Mo., did it twice, in 1954-55 and 1966-67, and Mercer 
County, N J., last year’s runner-up, took cham­ pionships in 
1973 and 
1974.

Holy Cross benefit 

Sylvester on Rocky 

SUNDAY M agazine columnist 
Bon W hite brings you an in­ terview with the Italian Stal­ lion of New York city, Sylves­ 

 fit she calls her pet project: Holy Cross High 
School. 
Miss Carr's first a p ­ pearance here during 
HemisFair 68 included a visit to the W est Side high school, which was threatened at the time with being closed. 
The visit and a belief that “ education is the answer to 75 per cent of the problem s facing 
Mexicans-Americans' ‘ prompted the creation of the Holy Cross Endow­ ment Fund and assisted the school’s salvation. 
Born Florencia Bisenta de 
Casillas 
M artin ez 
Cardona and the oldest of seven children, Miss 
Carr includes in her other public efforts work with 
American Lung Associa­ tion, Muscular Dystrophy and the John Tracy Chil­ dren's Clinic. 
The 
3 6 -y e a r-o ld 
El 
Paso native is a past re­ cipient of the “ For God and Youth Award" pre­ 

 sented in 1975 by the

Jimmy Buffett: 

H e’s laughing at us 

There are many routes to success in the music business. Some go dir­ ectly from demolition work to the most impor­ tant job in music today 
— setting off the smoke bombs. Others learn to play the jump suit. 
(if all the clever ways to get ahead, one of the most sensible is that of 
.Jimmy Buffett He lolls around. 
For years now , Buffett has been absolutely bra­ zen about it. 11** has not attended a single party where Bianca lagger has been present. 
And everyone knows that is more or less ex­ pected of any musician who wants to get men­ tioned in Rolling Stone. 

INSTEAD, he hangs around Key West on a boat. Every time a new album comes out, there he is lolling around that boat looking happy. 
You get the feeling he is laughing at us. He lau g h s at ev e ry th in g else. lh' calls his band the 
( oral Reefers. He once put out an album called 
“ A White Sport (.'oat and a Pink Crustacean.” One of its highlights has that sp irite d s in g a lo n g 
‘ Honey, Why Don't We 
(let Drunk and Blank.” 
Buffett has good rea­ son to laugh. After he refused to move to New 
York or Lls Angeles or some other dreary place to make his music, the music industry has fin­ ally begun to move him. 
Island rh y th m s are very big now. Buffett's fine new alb u m , 
‘‘Changes in Latitudes. 
Changes in A ttitudes” 
(ABC), has enough of an island rock fend to appeal to that crowd. 
It also bas articulate songs — and enough of 
Buffett's humor — to ap­ peal to people who think as well . 
M A N Y of the songs describe the fm*d«m oi living in end of the world kind of places. But there are those other overtones tis). 
As an o th er good songwriter once noted, freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose. 
So, in the title song, 
Buffett can play the 
I leach bum laughing that 
“ if it suddenly ended tomorrow, I could some­ how adjust to the fall. 
But in ‘ M arg arita- 
V il le , ” Buffett sings of having nothing to show for the year but a new tattoo. 
Although the tattoo's a beauty, there is a sug­ gestion that there are some disadvantages in tieing wasted on tequila 

 all tin* time, especially when you can't find the salt 

R E F F E T T also in ­ cludes Steve Goodman's 
‘ Banana Republics,” an excellent downbeat de­ scription of the ex p a­ triated Americans who come to tropical hideouts trying lo escape the land ut the free. 
Buffett does leave his adopted homeland on a couple of tunes. 
(in ‘‘Miss You So Bad­ ly,” he ends up on the road staying in a Holiday 
Inn with a bunch of sur­ geons who meet there once a year See, going out into the world isn t so hot. 
He also gives a good soulful version of an old 
Jesse Winchester song, 
"Biloxi.” 
Bullet! is an old folkie who has staked a new territory all his own. 
It is upbeat rhythm with congas and catchy st et11 guitar lines and haunting harmonica. But it also has words and thoughts Imagine that. 
He knew that if he waited down there long enough we would notice. 

AS A consumer pro­ tection service, it is my duty to inform you that th e re is now a real honest-to-goodness new 
George Benson album on the market. 
Benson’s ‘‘B reezin’” album sold well over a million copies and his 

JIMMY BUFFET 
On the Records 

 single from it, 
“This 
Masquerade,” was a Top 
Ten hit. For a jazz artist, that is considered an unnatural act. 
The success was cele­ brated by all his old record companies re-re­ leasing every recording they could find of him tuning up. 
Originally, many of those recordings sold in the high teens. 
The only newly r e ­ corded new Benson al­ bum is ‘‘In 
F lig h t” 
(Warner Bros.). The fact that Benson has a hit with a Leon Russell tune has not permanently de­ bilitated him as a jazz guitarist. Have no lear. 
The album is not George 
Benson sings Ned Seda- ka. 
There are six cuts, all of them too long to be considered Top 4(1 Picks to Click. Benson dares to sing again on four of them , ‘‘N ature Boy,” 
"The World is a Ghet­ to,” "Gonna Love You 
More” and " E v e n thing 
Must Change.” 
Benson tends to dis­ m iss the controversy among jazz fans* over whether he has sold out because he has sold. 
That seems like a good thing to do with contro­ versies among jazz fans. 

ALTHOUGH it has given his career a new boost, lumping Tompall 
Glaser in with all the other country outlaws does him a disserv ice. 
While Way Ion and the gang are moving country music into rock, Tompail is up to something en­ tirely different. 
Ii started several years ago when lie picked up some blues m usicians from the band of Bobby 
(Blue) Bland. Not a one of them tu rn ed into 
Charley Pride. 
Tompall’s creative un­ ion of black urban blues and white country stan­ dards is shown again on his new album. ‘‘Tom­ pall Glaser and His Out­ law Band 
(ABC). 
The way he m akes m usic out of little country tunes like “ You 
Can Have Her” has to Ik* heard. Tonipall’s hoarse. gravelly vocals sound just like they should — like they have had a little whiskey poured over them. 
The songs range from dow nbeat 
("Tennessee 
Blues” ) to big beat ("I 
Just Want to Hear the 
Music” ) to outrageously offbeat (“ Let My Fingers 
Do the Walking” ). 
Another song. "Come 
Back Shane,” longs for the cowboys who weren't co m m ercial p roducts. 
Glaser has never been that. But he has always been interesting

H.K.jr 

By the look on the Houston m an’s face you would’ve thought he had entered the Pearly Gates instead of 
La Louisiane Restaurant. 
"W e’ve heard so much about your place and now w e’ve finally m ad e it here. You just don’t know how excited we are,” he told the head waiter as the m an and his wife were seated. 
After taking a moment to survey the r e s t a u r ­ a n t’s plush red decor, tuxedoed w aiters and whirling ceiling fans, the couple opened th eir menus and their eyes wi­ dened. 
It was everything they had heard and more. 
“ Oh the choices a g o u rm et has m ake in life ,” the m an ha I f - mumbled — a hint of de­ light in his voice. 
M aybe this would be the night to have the soft shell crab sau te m eu n ­ iere for $9 5o. Then again it might be the night for escargot, the m an had always wondered what snails really taste like. 
As the man scanned the wine list, his eyes halted at “ N iestein er

Now that would be so­ mething to tell the boys back at the office. But be might have to take the bottle back so they would believe him and that would be less than r e ­ fined. 
After all he wasn't go­ ing to come off like an 
East Texas bumpkin in a restaurant that’s seen the likes of Lily Pons and 
Robert Redford. 
Just then his wife asked, 
“ Honey, why don’t we go all the way and try the gourmet din­ ner. It’s the last page in the menu.” 
After flipping to the page the m an knew he had come to the moment of truth and it looked like he was going to have to come clean. 
It wasn’t the price on the d in n e rs, which ranged from $82 to $75, that bothered him . He came prepeared for that. 
The truth of the matter was the m an really wasn’t a seasoned gour­ met at all. He and his wife were just people who w anted to ex p erien ce gourmet dining at least once, but really didn t know what

Riccardo Muti 

8 t Dvorak’s No. 9 

B> DAVID ANTHONY RICHELIEU 

There are about two dozen recordings of 
Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9. 
About four are worthy of note — one of them being a late 5os recording by Rafael Kubelik and the Vienna Philharmonic on London. 
This recording is still available and stands as one of the most electrifying readings of this popu­ lar symphony. 
Since the Dvorak symphonies were renumbered and the “ New World” Symphony — which was form erly the Fifth — becam e the Ninth there hasn't been a decent new recording released of this 
Bohemian masterpiece. 
At least, not until now 
The unlikely source of this new release is not. as one might suspect, someone who eats goulash for breakfast or a distant relative of Count Dracula. 
It is a Neopolitan by the name of Riccardo Muti 
— a young energetic conductor who looks like he could easily be in one of those Hunt’s Prim a Salsa ads saying: “ It’sa thick and sesty.” 
Nor is the orchestra the secret here — it is not the Czech Philharmonic or anything in the im m e­ diate area. Instead, it is the New Philharmonia, that updated English institution that put Angel into the serious classical record business back when it was also competing with its domestic corporate sister Capitol and such names as Leinsdorf. Stein- lx*rg and Alfred Newman. 
So here we have an Italian conductor whipping the stick to an internationally recognized but never overly excited London orchestra in a piece that some critics still dismiss as Bohemian kitsch. 
The results — unexpectedly dazzling. 
If this is goulash, it’s got some succulent Italiaif spices mixed in and flaming plumb pudding on the side. 
Both orchestra and Muti delve into the Ninth with enthusiasm, flair, vigor and a fullness that has eluded so many of the latest recordings. 

The sound is rich. the performance broad and precise Mull ha*-, the orchestra crisp where it needs to bo and mellow where it ought to be. 

The themes come through with brilliance and 
Clarity and Muti understands what this ‘ New 
World” of Dvorak’s music was ult about. 

T his is the first recording we have heard of 
Midi's. 

 tine of the liner notes compares him with Tos­ canini — and it isn t just because they were both 
Italian. 

This is a young man to watch and to listen to. His direction here is certainly world class and is easily the artistic m atch of the understandably vivid rendition by Kubelik. 

Only the newer engineering on this Angel makes it a better all-around performance 

I highly recommend this for everyone’s li­ brary. This performance sets a new standard for this popular piece. Angel has it on Stereo/Quad 
< S-3723D». 

If you've got the hungrtes for Dvorak or haven't listened to the Ninth lately, th e re s plenty to savor on this ta sty platter 

Hamlet, Over Easy 

Don’t Can It 

 lf you want to find some way to preserve foods, but 

 don t want to go to the bother and expense of 

 canning, check into dehydrating foods. 

The process is told in detail in a book, “ Oven 
Drying' by Irene Crowe. 

Crowe began experimenting with ways of pre­ 

 serving food while working in an orphanage in New 

M exico. 
She spent three years perfecting her 

 methods and she claims the method is less expensive 

 than canning, takes up less shelf space, and has a 

 better flavor, especially for fruits. 

The book includes instructions for drying virtually 

 every type of food, green beans, oranges, eggs, 

 blackberries, shrimp, artichokes, beef jerky, potatoes or walnuts.

“ Ham let” is generally considered the prince of 

Shakespeare's plays, and one can expect no finer 

 production that the one scheduled to open at of 

Incarnate W ord College March 24. 

The show will be directed by Ronald Ibbs, IWC s 

 artist-in-residence and a veteran actor who received 

 his training in London under Sir Tyrone Guthrie, 

Michel St. Denis and W . H. Auden. He was the 

 leading man for the 
Earl of Longfor's Company at 

 the G ate Theater in Dublin and has played nearly 

 all of Shakespeare’s leading roles. 

Starring as Hamlet is Richard Jones, a member of 

 the IWC faculty who is well known for his excellent 

 work in San Antonio in “ A Doll s House and 
Alice 

 and 
W onderland and who has worked at the 

Champlaine Shakespeare Festival in Vermont. 

But IW C will be presenting more than just a play. 

For those who want a deeper understanding of 

‘‘Ham let,” the college is offering a continuing 

 education course that will meet three times before 

 students in the course see the play. 

The course will look at the structure of the play, 

 the performance and the literary experience with 

IWC faculty members, including 
Ibbs and 
Jones, 

 guiding the students. Price of tuition, $15, includes 

 admission to the play.

MARINA MUNOZ 

9o2 Brady 
BURBANK HIGH SCHOOL 

Music occupies most of Marina Munoz’ time, and she likes it that way. 
In fact, she is hoping for a career in music following study at the 
Eastman School of Music or Juilliard School. 

A four-year member of the Burbank Bulldog Band, Marina serves as its president and has been named outstanding band member in her class as a freshman, sophomore and junior. She was named to the district, region, area and all-state bands, as well as the all-star band at the 
Southwest Stage Band Festival. She also plays flute in the San Antonio 
Youth Symphony. 

In addition to music, Marina finds time to study, ranking fifth in her class of 4r)o with a 3.8 grade point average. She is a member of the 
National Honor Society, English Honor Society and French Club and serves on the staff of the school’s literary magazine. 

The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Manuel G. Munoz was elected president of her class as a freshman and vice president the following year. 

She also enjoys playing softball on her church team during the sum­ mers. Marina will soon be honored by the 
Optimist Club of San Antonio for her ac­ complishments.

Sri Lanka has issued a new stam p to honor the 
Bicentennial celebration and in recognition of the close ties between the two countries. 
Sri Lanka postal offi­ cials point out that New 
England sailors landed in their ports in the 17Kos and that the United 
States in recent years has been of great help aiding its flood victims. 
Sri Lanka was former­ ly Ceylon. The name was changed in 1972. 
The new stamp depicts the Statue of Liberty in 
New York harbor. 
Another philatelic tri­ bute to the United States com es from the M al­ dives. which has issued two new stamps honoring the V iking space mission to Mars. 
One stamp shows the 
Viking Lander separat­ ing from the orbiter with the planet Mars in the background. 
The other stamp illus­ trates the Viking Lander on

By INK DIPPER 

Editor of I ho ( It l imos-Jo u rn a l 
Up until now, the Fe­ deral Com m unital ions

Now — on an experi­ mental basis at least — the agency is trying to change some attitudes in hopes that it ean improve compliance of ('Bing re­ gulations without resort­ ing to fines or other punitive measures. 
The exp erim en t is under way in the Nor­ folk. Va., area, ( liers frequently hear. “ This is 
KFCC-1oo, your Uncle 
Charlie, here.” 
The call letters are those of the FCC’s na­ tional center for enforce­ ment team traiining in 
Norfolk, where prospec­ tive government officers are taught how to detect illegal CB operations and make cases against the law breakers. 
Uncle Charlie is the handle ( liers have tradi­ tionally used to identify the agency 
Trainees at the Norfolk center are taking to the air to remind ( hers of the proper way to use their equipment — no scolding, no fines, just one person talking to an­ other. 
Primarily, the FCC is encouraging ( liers to use their call letters, but at the same time a ptich is In'ing made for them to observe other regula­ tions and radio manners. 
Citers iii the area are typical of Citers across the country — most don't bother using call letters. 
“ F orgetting” to use call letters is one of six 

 infractions that makes 
Uncle Charlie mad en­ ough to take some form of enforcement action. 
The other five are: 
• Using more power to transmit than the five watts allowed under re­ gulations ('Bors can add more power sometimes as much as several thou­ 

 sand extra watts — by either modifying regular equipm ent or adding special amplifiers. 
•

Around the World 

By STAN DELAPLANE 

“ However, I could only stand six months of it.” said a friend who m i­ grated from New York. 
“ I had a cozy cottage out at Stepaside. Close to 
Dublin. When life got creaky, I flew to London for a weekend of the theaters and the flesh­ pots of Shepherd’s M ar­ ket. 
“ But I was geared for 
Manhattan. T h re e - m a r­ tini lun ch eon s at the 
Palm Grill. And a fte r­ noon fix with a P a rk 
Avenue shrink who a d ­ vised me to ACCEPT my wife.” 

After six months he flew back to New York. 

“ I commute to West­ chester and am living miserably ever after.” 

“ Is it true what they say about Tahiti and T a ­ hiti g i r l s ’ ’’

Photo Tips 

WithRon 
Jones 

They call ii soup, that gooey alkaline mess properly known as film developer. 
It is one of the more difficult variables to control in photography. Unlike that simmering pot in which is dumped a little of this, a pinch of that, wing of bat and eye of newt. the smallest change in composition of developer will greatly affect film developer. 
At one time or another, I have used almost everything imaginable as a film developer — from stinking industrial waste dipped raw from the East River to the latest most esoteric pushing developers. All of them will cause some image to appear on the film. 

B IT WHAT THE CONCERNED photographer wants is not just an image. Ile wants the particular image he visualized when he tripped the shutter. Something much more difficult to obtain. lf a person wants only an image, any image, he would send hints film to the corner drugstore for a 3 x 5 inch ' “snapshots.” 
A quality, custom lab can produce beautifully consistant negatives Rut if you are into black and vvhite photography you may have a hard time finding a lab interested in giving your film proper care. 
The solution is to do it yourself. 
Home development is not difficult. The com­ plication comes when you try to establish solid consistency. 
Any little thing can change tonality, grain structure, density, contrast and evenness of development. 
Please don’t let this scare you away from home development. Only keep these things in mind for truly consistent results. 
When mixing developer, water quality is important. Some people use distilled water. In 
San Antonio that is not a bad idea. 

FILM DEVELOPED is soup mixed in hard water will print differently than that developed using artifically softened water. The original condition of the water at mixing will influence film development. 
One is not necessarily better than the next but for consistency mix your chemicals with the same quality water each time. 
Temperature is another factor. 

MOST DEX ELOPERS have a time and tem­ perature chart which gives the inaccurate im­ pression that film developed for H minutes at KH degrees, for example, will bo exactly the same as if that film were dev eloped for 5Va minutes at 75 degrees. 
When considering denisty alone, these time and temperature charts work. American Nation­ al Standards Institute (those friendly guys who bring you ASA) sets requirements for density. To keep the same ASA rating over a given set of time and temperature combinations the density must bt1 stable 
But ANSI does not set the same rigid standards for granularity, tonality, etc. 
Higher temperatures usually create rougher grain and a reduced tonal range 
Bul cooler means longer wet times and this gives grain more chance to form. You need to find a compromise. Best to standardize on your aver­ age wash temperature 
Agitation effects everything Ki*ep it gentle and keep it consistent You are developing film not making a milk shake. 
Pick up the film tank. Ris k it gently. A gentle half turn in both directions and a thump to dislodge bubbles should do a good job. 

AGITATE THE FILM in the developer ever 3o seconds or each minute or every two minutes. 
The frequency n> less important than consis­ tency Film should be agitated only enough to ensure even development. 
(’heck the broad neutral areas of your nega- 

PAG! I 
IXPfffSS-MfWS SUNDAY MAGAZU*!— Mar. 13,1977 

 tives (such as a clear sky), if there are streaks or uneveness in the neutral areas then you either agitated too much or not enough. 

 lf you follow these suggestions you will be well on the way to a consistent negative. The other chemicals are important also but the developer sets the stage. 

Before you pick a developer that you plan to live with I want to do some tub thumping for my standard: D-7K. 

Not very flashy, Kodak D-76 has been around for 3o or 4o years in one disguise or another. 
Maybe it has lasted so long because it is so versatile. 

Most amateurs shy away from something so simple as I)-7t» because they think it is an amateur developer. 

Pashaa! 

The stuff works consistantly, It is less affected by water quality than many of the pushing and compensating developers, has remarkable shelf life in partially full bottles (the way most am ateurs store their chem icals) and (glory halleluia!) it is cheap. 

I have no fear in pushing two f/stops (under exposing or rating my film at E l. IWK)) or underdeveloping one stop (E l 2oo on Tri-X) in 
D-7K It is a general purpose developer and can bail me out of almost any goofy lighting situa­ tion. 

ASPIRING PHOTOJOURNALISTS should plan to spend some time at the Witte Transportation 
Museum. Their photo show “ The American 
Farm ” is, for lack of a more powerful word, impressive. 

Work by Doris I'lmann, Dorothea Lange and 
Lewis Kine spark this major exhibit. With its 173 photographs, the show will hang until April 17.

Rags-to-riches fantasy atm osphere 

When a new actor comes along with memorable screen performance, there’s always the question of how much is acting and how much is just the perform er’s own personality com­ ing through. 
It s even a b ig g e r question with .Sylvester 
Stallone, an actor most people had never heard of before the film 
“ Rocky’’ began a ttra c t­ ing crowds. His role of a n o t-to o -b rig h t, s m a ll­ tim e boxer w as ta ilo r m ad e for him by the w riter who understands 
Stallone best — Stallone himself. 
Like the fairy tale 
“ Rocky” becomes when the boxer gets a chance at the heavyw eight championship, Stallone's own rags-to-riches tale has an a tm o s p h e re of fantasy about it. From pretty much an unknown year ago, Stallone is now contending for Aca­ dem y Award n o m in a ­ tions for both acting and writing. 
At a press conference 
Stallone com es close to doing a Rocky imitation. 
His speech is spiced with the sa m e “ va kn o w s” that Rocky uses. Stallone ex h ib its som e of the sa m e m a ch ism o as he infers that a New York 
T itle didn t like Rocky because the critic is gay. 
And he attacks those who call ‘‘Rocky” a fantasy with the sam e fury that 
Rocky exhibits when he goes after his opponent in the ring. 
Real 
“ Something like this is not a r a r ity ,” Stallone says of an obscure fighter being given a chance at the title. “ A lot of cham ­ pions don’t want to lose the ch am p io n sh ip . So they fight bums. It’s not an a b s u rd p rem ise. It happens all the tim e.” 
But “ R ocky” d id n ’t seem like reality a few years ago. T h a t’s when 
Stallone, ac to r and writer, was in the pits. 
The son of working, mid­ dle-class p a re n ts , he grew up in a neighbor­ hood where his Italian fam ily 
“ was out of sync,’’ and he carried a lot of frustration around with him ’ 
“There was 3o years of eating crap . . . a lot of frustration,” he says. 
At one point Stallone packed up his frustration and went to Europe. 
“ That was back in the 
’oos when everyone was try in g to find th e m ­ se lv e s ,” he says. “ I should have opened a de­ tective agency to help people find themselves. 
Found self 
“ Anyway, I was sitting in Europe and one day I reach ed down and grabbed my butt and said, 
‘Here it is?’ I found my­ self. I came back on the first ship to the U. S. and th a t’s when I s ta rte d writing.” . 
Writing might not have been the best choice of careers for someone who admits he “ got seven Fs in English Fin bad at graffiti. I couldn’t even write a bad cheek.” But eventually Stallone had some minor success. 
For a while Stallone 

W HITE 

 w rote som e television s c rip ts for lovv-budget horror shows (’’Monster of M anchester,” “ T erri­ ble T im m y ” ). He was headed for some serious depression, and his s i­ multaneous attem pts to be an actor didn’t help. 
“ The first time I audi­ tioned was for Sal Minco for ‘F o rtu n e in M en’s 
Eyes.’ I was rejected four or five times. Maybe that got to me. I mean, I had been rejected by a know n actor. 
“ That started my de­ pression going in a bad direction. I’d write plays in which a troupe of ac­ tors would kidnap every pro d u cer in town and send them out to sea. 
Then the ac to rs would put on make-up to look like those producers. You can sec why they weren't selling. Imagine showing that to David M errick.” 
(Jets work 
He began getting a few parts but he w asn’t proud of them. “ I was playing only guys with fixations. . 
. guys that strangled wo­ men, beat up little guys with crutches, shot skids. 
Stinko.” 
During this depression he wrote the first version of “ Rocky.” It was a de­ cidedly different script, with a downbeat ending that had Rocky throwing away his shot at the title. 
But Stallone decided an unknow n w rite r could never sell a pessimistic script. 
“ A fter five y e a rs of failu re, I decided to completely take my phi­ losophy. switch it around and try to m ak e it optimistic. Everything is nice, th e r e ’s a rose in 
S panish H arlem s y n ­ drome. And it seem s to have worked.” 

Stallone also admi Is to some pure luck — getting in touch with the p ro ­ ducers at a tim e when they w eren ’t busy. But even afte r he sold the script there was still a lot ol work getting them to i ast him in the lead role. 
“ I d proven to myself that I could write. But I wasn't sure I could act. 
With Rocky I was going to either prove I had it or that I was living a crip­ pled, illusioned life. 

Desperate 

“ J couldn’t sell myself at first. I wasn't m arke­ table. No one knew me outside of close relations and enemies. They shot the sc rip t for a while try in g to get Jim m y 
(aan, Robert Redford or 
Ryan O 'N eal. F in ally they said , ‘lf we can m ake his movie for $1 million, you can do it.’ It was just a case of bt* be­ ing stubborn. I was more desperate than hungry.” 
The rest, as they say, is history — or at least 
H ollyw ood’s fairy tale version of history. The film and S tallone are hits, and Stallone is working on a sequel. 
“ I don’t want to play that c h a r a c te r for the rest of my life, but I ori­ ginally planned to con­ tinue the character, lie s got a universal appeal. 
” 1 figure I can do IK or 
17 roles before I s ta rt parodying myself. When someone hits me with a c ra te of to m a to e s, I ’ll know Eve slipped. 
“The only thing I’ve got to worry about is when I begin to believe that I am 
Sylvester Stallone of the printed page, ya know. 
I t’s cra zy . I ’m not so ­ m e th in g sp ecial. I ’m lucky.”

H eilm an, Hiss and the early 195os 

By ROGER F I NK 
SCO UNDREL. T IM E 
(L ittle , Brown; $7 95) is 
L illia n Heilman s superb m em oir of the anticom ­ m unism hysteria of the 
195os — th a t sta in on 
Am erican history which has been lig h te n e d n e ith e r by tim e nor subsequent n a tio n a l traumas. lf, this tim e, the stric­ tures on her contem por­ a rie s are p a rtic u la rly unsparing, it was, after a ll, she, and not they, who found the courage that was required. 
H eilm an is one of the few heroes of the 
M cC a rthy years. Sum ­ moned before the House 
E n-A m erican Act iv hies 
C om m ittee in 1952, she refused, at the real risk of going to ja il, to te ll which of her friends and acq uaintances were m em bers of the C om ­ munist Party. 
“ Thank God somebody finally had the guts to do i t , ” a re p o rte r at her hearing cried out. 

Then and now one of our most distinguished pla yw rig h ts (a u th o r of 
“ The C h ild re n ’s H our” and “ The Little Foxes” ), 
Heilm an stubbornly re ­ jected “ inh um an and indecent and dishonora­ b le ” dem ands on her conscience. 
She con­ founded a committee that had watched other nota­ bles first engage in pre­ scribed hand w rin g in g and second confess that, ah yes, there were some 
C om m unists they had known and would patrio­ tically name. 
D ire c to r E lia Kazan appeared as a "frie n d ly witness” to tell the com­ m itte e e v e ry th in g he knew about everyone he knew. P la y w rig h t C lif­ ford Odets preached re­ sistance but p ra cticed cooperation. 
" I feel betrayed by tin* nonsense 
I had be­ lieved.” Heilman writes 
“ I had no right to think that A m erican in te lle c ­ tuals were people who would light for anything if doing so would injure

 them .” 
Heilman offered lo tes­ tify about herself if the 
Committee would agree not to ask her to testify about others. In a letter to HU AC. she wrote, “ I am not w illing, now or in the future, to bring bad trouble to people who . . . were completely innocent of any talk or any action that was d is lo y a l or subversive . . . I cannot and w ill not cut m y conscience to fit th is year's fashions.” 
Her o ffe r, of course, was rejected. But when she did appear before 
HUAC, she asked the 
Committee to reconsider. 
At that point her le tte r 

 was distributed to the press. 
L e ft b a ffle d by her courage and the re ­ p o rte r's o u tb u rs t in praise of it. HUAC d is ­ missed Heilman after f>7 minutes. She did not go to ja il, but she did suffer. 
Screen-writing jobs dried up. She was forced to sell her farm and, at one low point, to clerk in a Man­ hattan department store 
O thers who follow ed, in c lu d in g p la y w rig h t 
A rth u r Mille r and actor 
Zero Mostel, also resisted 
HU AC’ s dem ands. And they all took their lumps. 
Heilman and Mostel went v irtu a lly w ithou t w ork for a decade. Blacklisted. 
In his introduction to 
H eilm an 's book, C a rry 
W ills contends that the man who gave his name to the e ra. W isconsin 
S enator 
Joseph 
M cC a rth y, was not as 

 much to blam e fo r its anti com m unist excesses as was President H arry 
Trum an. T rum an's infa­ mous loyalty program s, started in 1947, were, in 
W ills' opinion, the “ o ri­ gin al s in ” of M cC arth- yism. 
P rofessor 
R icha rd 
F rie d , in men against 
M cC arthy 
(C o lu m b ia 
U n iv e rs ity 
P ress; 
$14 95). takes this anti- 
T rum an revisionist his­ tory with a grain of salt 
— deservedly, since the grip of anti com m unism re q u ire s a broade r ex­ planation 
As F rie d shows, the 
New Deal was, from the b e g in n in g , view ed by m any R epublicans as th in ly disguised 
B olshevism . F ro m its birth in 1938, HUAC was used to oppose F1)R s 
“ sabotage of capitalism ” and the rise of labor un­ 

 ions. A nti-C om m unism fears were fed by the fall of Eastern Europe to the 
R ussians, by R u ssia ’ s explosion of an atom ic bomb, and by the failure of the D em ocrats to m ount an e ffe c tiv e re ­ buttal to McCarthy. 

“ ALG ER HISS TH E 
TRUE STORY” by John 
Chabot Smith Choil. Rin­ ehart and Winston; $15 is about the m ost c o n tro ­ versial HUAC inquiry — the inquiry into whether 
Hiss passed secret go­ 

 vernm ent documents to the Soviet Union. In 195o a federal ju ry found Hiss guilty and sentenced this 
H arvard Law graduate, clerk to Supreme Court 
Justice Holmes and a t­ tendant to FDR at Yalta to prison and to a ruined career and reputation. 

Since his co n v ic tio n there has been no let up in arg u m e nts over whether Hiss was index'd guilty or sim ply another v ic tim of the hysterical times.

Have you by any chance been considering writing lo an elephant'.’ 
(A beastly thought?). 
Ii so, sin g er Kenny 
Starr is the man to see if you want the names of som e potential pen pal pachyderms. 
Starr — he’s the young fellow who stored with 
“ B lind 
Man in the 
B le a c h e r s” 
— lias compiled a long list of elephants, live of course. 
The list co n ta in s the names and addresses of som e of the more famous tusk-toting anim als. 
N a tu ra lly , th ere s a g im m ick to 
S ta r r ’s bright idea. He mailed his latest recording, “ Me and the Elephant ”, to elephants in zoos across the co u n try . Such as 
“Tundra and Sundra" in 

Topeka. “Ole Diam ond” in k n o x v ille and “ L a­ verne’’ of New York's 
B ronx. 
(W hat, no 
“Jum bo” ?) 
“ The list,” deadpans 
Starr, “ is available to anyone who has a yen to correspond with an ele­ phant. “ Who knows,” ho adds, laughing, “ I may become the first record­ ing artist to have e le ­ phants a s fan clu b m em bers?” 
Send 
’em pean u ts on th eir birthdays? 
“ I sure won’t be the one to tell any of them they can’t join.” 
B S. Starr’s address is 
27 M usic Square East, 
Nashville 372o3.

“ Baby Penny” answers, don’t hang up?

If I had the sure-proof answer to that question 
I'd be rich as Rockefeller 
— which I'm hardly. 
I can only offer, from time to tim e, the advice of the pros; their form u­ la. system or whatever. 
Ever hear of a singer- writer named with unli­ kely n am e of 
Bobby 
Gosh? (He has a current hot recording titled “ 15 
Shades of the Rainbow ," which he also wrote.) 
Here is a tip from Gosh 
(By Golly) for tyro com ­ posers and ly r ic ists------- 
“ W hen you w rite a song, w rite it with an artist iii mind, then do everything you can to get it heard by that artist — get on the phone, start a letter cam paign. The ar­ tist and his producer are the best people to get to. 
Most of the tim e, esp e­ cially if you are not well known in the songwriting field, it isn’t easy. You

G ram m y aw ard w in ­ ning vocalist Emmy Iou 
Harris cam e back here the other night for a concert — back to the city where she got her 
“start." 
“ And what a ‘start’ it w as,” she said, forcing a sm ile at the recollection. 
“ N obody around here w ould h ire m e a s a singer or guitarist — so I took a job as cocktail waitress in a second-rate lounge, where a big tip was a quarter and most of the p atron s w ere

THE STORY O f A BOY'S JOURNEY TO MANHOOD 

NOWL.TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST nME! 

 iXPRISS-NIWS SUNDAY MAGAZINE — Mor. 13, 1977 PAG! 13 

M yrna Loy and all her friends 

On Broadway 
NKW YORK - Myrna 
Loy came gingerly into 
Patsy’s restaurant on W. 
56th about two o’clock the other afternoon, slightly winded after rushing over from a rehearsal around the corner. 
She had just tossed back her short raccoon coat and sat down. when some people in the back waved at her and she waved back and smiled. 
“ Somebody you know?.” I asked. 
■*‘My friends. the waiters,’’ she nodded. 
“ Wonderful thing about having been on film — you have friends wher­ ever you go." 
Miss Loy has appeared it; more than 12o films, playing belly-dancers and girls with knives in their teeth, up to the leading woman to W il­ liam Powell. Clark Ga­ ble, 
Spencer 
Tracy, 
Leslie lloward, Walter 
Pidgeon and Cary Grant. 
Now at slightly beyond 
_7o. she was excited at going to Palm Beach to play the mother role in 
“ Barefoot in the Park.” wherein she gets mixed up with “ a crazy Hun­ garian,’’ portrayed by 
Jean-Pierre Aumont. 
“ We’ve been working so hard — tomorrow I have to get my hair done.” she told me. 
She refused a glass of wine. 
“ No, no. I ’m work­ ing,” she said “ I mostly do my own hair. I’m a real redhead, you know. 
It helped, I suppose, but it also caused me trou­ ble. It was almost or­ ange. 
“ Th** boys used to yell, 
‘Redhead, ginger bread, five cents a loaf.’ I d run and cry and skin my knees on the stairs For a long time when I started 
I played Orientals and wore black w igs 
“ I met a pilot who said he ust*d to fly me from 
L A. to N Y. back in the days when it took 15 hours. 
“ He said he’d often seen me asleep iii the plane, and had watched my red hair and freckled face in the sunlight.’ 
- Somebody had just seen “ The Thin Man” on 
TV the other night. 
“ Yes. 19.14, a bit of time ago. isn t it? It was a sleeper," 
Again Miss Loy paused to insist that she wouldn't hate any wine. 
“ W.S. Van Dyke was the director. He'd been say ing I was going to be a star. He had a thing alKiut pushing people in his swimming pool to see how they'd react. I guess 
I passed the swimming pool test. 
“ It was supposed to be ii little picture. It was sensation.” 

No Oscar has eve come her way “ I new even got a nomination, 
Miss Loy said with a light laugh that has familiar sound to he fans. 

“ I got a 
Brussels award for ‘Best Years of 
Our Lives’ with Fredric 
March and Robert Sher­ wood. They never gave awards for comedy. It used to make pie so mad. 
Comedy is so much more difficult to do.” 

It's very scary, she said, looking around see­ ing so many of her con­ temporaries that have gone. 
“ Pidge is still here. 
Cary Grant says he's re­ tired, I guess he is, but he looks wonderful. 
Maurice Chevalier is gone. We did ‘Love Me 
Truly.’ 
“ My first talkie was 

‘The Desert Song.’ I was a belly -dancer and she ratted on the Red Sha­ dow. 
“ The leading women were like Dolores Costel­ lo, who was John Barrv-

 with Claude Dauphin. 
“ I picked up a few awards, not for acting, but for attendance at 
Westbury.” 
Then she was in the revival of “ The Wo­ men.” which didn’t last long but got to Broad­ way. Her last movie was 
“Airport ‘75.” playing an 
Irish lady who drank boilermakers. 

She’s fascinated by the theater and its differ­ ences from movies. 
She was impressed at a special rehearsal with an audience that laughs at the jokes. 
“ In the movies you just keep on talking. In the theater, everybody freezes when the laugh starts, and waits till they stop.”

MANY buildings are so poorly de­ signed that the people who work in them become frustrated and ill, says a leading psychologist. 
Dr. Calvin W. Taylor of the Uni­ versity of Utah told THE STAR that today’s architects would do well to consult a psychologist be­ fore designing shops, offices, homes and factories. 
( " I t is a dreadful situation when a man or woman will take time off from their jobs because they just can’t face the drudgery of the conditions surrounding them at work,” Dr. Taylor said. 
I “ Architects and designers often give more thought to such things as exterior appearance and cost effectiveness than to a building’s impact on people’s health and be­ havior.

CHRISTINA KIRK 
! and GEORGE GORDON 

FAMILY man Jimmy Carter has launched a crusade against the casual attitude toward marriage he has found in Washington as well as the rest of the nation. 
He started by urging his White 
House aides to clean up their pri­ vate lives and chiding those who are living together unmarried. 
And he’s projecting the First 
Family as an example of how things should be ...mother, father and children all living under one roof as one big happy family. 
He’s already credited with sav­ ing the marriages of two of his aides — and causing another aide to get married. 
But many experts believe that this is one campaign President 
Carter can never win. All the lat­ est evidence points to a serious breakdown in the institution of marriage in this country. 
And nowhere is this more evi­ dent than the President’s doorstep in Washington, D.C., a city with a reputation for wrecking mar­ riages. 
Within a week of taking office, he sent a handwritten memo to his staff telling them to “watch yourselves and keep your families together.” 
Warning that there would be 

Carter has made it clear he wants family around him 

 times (rf crisis when they would have to stay at their desks all night, he added: 
“You’ll be much more useful to me and to the country if you have some recreation, get some exercise, and see your children and your spouses.” 
Behind President Carter s op­ position to couples living in sin is a wish to avoia his Administration being tainted by domestic scan­ dals and divorces. 
Later he told them: “Those of you who are living in sin, I hope you will get married Those of you who have left your spouses, go back home.” 
But President Carter’s words are likely to fall on deaf ears. A startling new report from the U S. 
Census Bureau has revealed that: 
• More than one-million Ameri­ can couples are living together out of wedlock; 
• The number of unwed house­ holds has more than doubled in the last six years; 
• Between 197o and 1975, the 

 number of single persons, aged 25 to 34 years, increased by 5o per­ cent; 
• The number of marriages has shown a marked decline while divorces are skyrocketing. 
The President is trying to keep the family tradition alive by mak­ ing it clear he wants his family around him in the White House and to participate in the Presiden­ cy. So all the Carters, except one married son, have moved into 
16oo Pennsylvania Avenue. 
The President and his wife. Ros- alynn, share the master bedroom on the second floor. Daughter 
Amy, 9, sleeps just down the hall. 
Two married sons and their wives have living quarters on the third floor. Jeff Carter, 24, at­ tends college while his wife, An­ nette. helps her mother-in-law with her First Lady duties. 
Last month, son Chip, 26, and his wife Caron brought the Cart­ ers’ second grandson, James Earl 
Carter IV, home from the hospi­ tal He’s occupying John Kennedy 
Jr.'s old nursery. 
The Carter family all take their

 meals together, whether it s a family supper or a state dinner. 
They represent the President at functions he cannot attend. 
President Carter underscores his views on marriage by being 

 openly affectionate with his wife and by attending church with his family every Sunday. 
But he caused some surprise by criticizing Washingtonians for liv­ ing in sin. They have always been more discreet than their counter­ parts in Hollywood, for example. 
About the only 
Washington couple to acknowledge their un­ married state are Sally Quinn and her boss, Ben Bradlee, both of the 
Washington Post. But Sally insists her lifestyle is not all that unusu­ al, even in Washington 
“The President seems to be preoccupied these days with the 

Thera are more ways of getting into trouble in this city 

 idea of ‘sinners’ and ‘sinning,’ ” said Sally in a recent Post article. 
“It is understandable that he would be thinking about it. For one thing, the Carter Administra­ tion has in its upper echelons sev­ eral young people who have not formalized their relationships and even some of his closest aides have lived with women without benefit of clergy ” 
The President certainly seemed embarrassed when one of his clos­ est staff members revealed dur­ ing the campaign that the woman with whom ne lived was not his wife. 
Greg Schneiders, 29, joined the 
Carter team early in the cam­ paign, first as errand runner and rapidly advanced to become a personal friend and advisor. 
Schneiders was valued mainly for his plain talk Early in the re­ lationship, he confided that he was living with a young woman and that sometime in the future they planned to marry. 
Carter was uncomfortable with the situation Once he told Schnei­ ders dud if any reporter asked about 
Biblical references to 
“adultery ” he would refer them to Schneickrs. 
Schneiders eventually married his long time roommate, Marie 
Hartnett, 28, on New Year’s Eve, after he was slated for the sensi­ tive job of appointments secretary to the President—a lob that would keep him in a daily association with the President 
He explained. “Us living to­ 

 gether could have been a source of embarrassment to 
Carter. 
There are a lot (rf Southern Bap­ tists who would have said, 'What s 
Jimmy Carter doing with this guy on the staff openly living in sin?’ ” 
The wedding was the first big social occasion of the new admin­ istration. President Carter did not attend, but his press secretary 
Jody Powell dicL Unfortunately for Schneiders, it didn’t earn him the appointments job. An FBI probe into his background dis­ closed a debt from a former busi­ ness venture and instead, he got the job of Projects Director. 
Carter’s assistant Hamilton Jor­ dan and White House Press Secre­ tary Jody Powell both had mar­ riages which were under severe strain after two years of grueling campaign work* 
Carter had a special word with both men. He told them to cut down on their working hours and spend time making up to their wives for two years’ absence. 
Powell’s wife Nan says of her 
11-year marriage: “There have been some real down sides of it for me. I’ve gone through some real rough spots.” Public life had put a strain on the marriage but since Carter’s words there had been an improvement. 
“All we have to compare it with is campaigning Anything is bet­ ter than that. At least we are in the same town again, the same

Nancy, now settling into their home in

“He usually leaves home be­ tween 7 and 7 JO a m. and gets 

“I think right now with trying to get everything settled, it s proba bly longer and rougher than it will be.” 
For William Beasley Harris, an administrative law judge in the 
Federal 
Maritime Commission, the situation is reversed. He is married to Patricia Roberts Har­ ris, the new Secretary of Housing and 
Urban 
Development. 
She leaves home at 7 a.m. and gets back as late as 9 p m. 
Judge Harris breaks up the long wait by dropping in at her office and waiting to dnve her home. He takes along books and magazines to read. “When you have some­ body who is trying to do a job they need all the support they can get,” he says. 
President Carter, along with mil­ lions of voters, has been shocked by the outbreak of Capitol Hill di­ vorces that were announced as soon as the votes were counted in last November’s elections. 
Senators 
Donald 
Riegle 
(D- 
Mich.), 
Lowell 
Weicker 
(R- 
Conn ), and Herman Talmadge 
(DCa.) all revealed divorce plans as soon as they were reelected. 
They joined a growing Congres­ sional chib of newly-divorced or separated lawmakers, including:

(R-Tex), 
Alan

Cranston (D-Calif.), Dick Clark

Haskell 
(D 
Colo ), Edward Brook (R-Mass), 
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev ), Bob Eek hardt (D-Tex ), Barry Coldwater 
Jr. (R-Calif.), and James Colman 
(D.-Calif.). 
Family counselor Lori Eisen- berg of Washington explained: 
“The pitfalls for a marriage are ater in Washington because of long hours, the intensity of professional effort and the excite­ ment of sharing this experience— often with fellow staff members rather than with your spouse— which can become part of a mag­ netic attraction.” 
Nancy Riegle, who was di vorced by Senator Don Riegle five years ago, thinks that the person­ ality of politicians is to blame for 
Washington’s divorce rate. 

Senator Riegle has just an nounced that he and his second wife, Meredith, whom he married less than two months after divorc­ ing Nancy, have also broken up. 
Meredith had stood by him dur­ ing a nasty re-election campaign in which it was revealed that sev­ en years ago, while rcfcirned to

In a recent interview Hamilton 
Jordan requested, “My wife’s name is Nancy. Don’t forget to

“All politicians start off with a bad case (rf ego,” she says. 
"Who else would put them­ selves in a popularity contest ev­ ery two years? Don began to be more and more anxious for pow­ er.” 

Nancy, Riegle had an affair with an unpaid worker in his Congres­ sional office. The mistress. Bette 
Jane Ackerman, taped love con­ versations with him so she could tear his voice whenever she chose. 
Those tapes and Ackerman’s al­ legations that her go-between in the torrid romance was none oth­ er than Meredith White, the new 

Coffer’s clean-up campaign 

Mrs. Riegle, were exposed before the November election. 
Riegle still retained his seat with 53 percent of the vote. 
On the first day of his new term, Riegle and Meredith an­ nounced. “O ur decision to di­ 

 vorce...is a very personal one, ar­ rived at amicably, and we will have no further comment." 
Senator Taimadge, 63, filed a tition for divorce on December from his wife, Betty, after 35 years of marriage. 
Mrs 
Tai­ 

 madge heard about it on her car radio. She said: "I was shocked, amazed and surprised But this is his decision." 

The Senator’s only explanation was to repeat what he said in his divorce petition: That he deemed 
Prince C bar lie's angels? No, we’re not interested, say 4 beauties 

FOUR wealthy U.S. beauties have been nomi­ nated by a British newspaper to be the next 
Queen of England. 
Cele Briscoe, Dallas Pell, Heather Whitney and 
Anne Lindsay were picked as possible Charlie’s An­ gels for Prince Charles, heir-apparent to the British throne. 
But this week they told THE STAR: Thanks-but no thanks. 
None of them wants to play Cinderella to Char­ lie’s Prince Charming and some are not even amused by the newspaper’s tongue-in-cheek "pro­ posal.” 
Cele is the daughter of Gov. Dolph Briscoe of 
Texas. Heather’s mother is wealthy Mrs. Cornelius 
Vanderbilt Whitney. Dallas's blueblood father is 
Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. And Anne is the daughter of Sen. John Linsday, New York may- or-tumed-TV star. 
The London Daily Mirror said a match between 
Charles and anyone of the four girls ‘‘would work wonders for the Anglo-American alliance." Judging from the girls’ reaction, however, the alliance will have to get along without them. 

Cele Briscoe: She wouldn't mind meeting the Prince. 
Heather Vanderbilt with stepfather 
Cornelius: "Ludicrous." 

Cele Briscoe, 2o, said: "He’s very nice, but I prefer a Robert 
Redford type. That doesn't mean 
I wouldn’t want to meet him—but as for marriage, I don’t think so." 

News that Cele was being men­ tioned reached her family nearly two weeks before her name ap­ peared in London. 

 any medical emergency, and would like to take the wheel of an 
I ambulance to save a life or help someone. 
"But talk of Buckingham Pal­ ace is all a big joke," said Dallas, who attends Boston University. 
And that seemed to be the reac­ 

 tion at the home of Heather Whit ney. 21. 
A member of her mother’s staff gasped: "One of Charlie’s An­ gels? This is too ludicrous for words! I’m sure neither Heather nor her mother would want to make any comment at all." 

Anne 
Lindsay, 
21-year-old daughter of the ex-New York mayor, said she toured England several years ago but didn't re­ member Buckingham Palace 
"If only 
I’d known." she laughed. "I would have paid more attention."

‘ Someone very mysteriously about me,” said Cele, a Southern 
Methodist University journalism student with her eye on a TV career. "I think this is very, very funny. My mother and father think it will be the talk (rf Texas. 
Quite honestly, I don't know much about Charles. From what I have read he appears to be a very wee young man, and very intelligent/’ 

Dallas Pell’s mother. Mrs Nu- ala Pell, thought the whole thing was a scream "Wonderful, abso­ lutely wonderful," she laughed. 

Then, in the best style of a poli­ tician’s wife, she added "I will say this—I Hunk the young man has an excellent job and absolute ly wonderful prospects 

"I was introduced to him and the Queen while attending a meet frig in London. I found nim an en­ gaging and extremely likeable person. I think he will make an excellent son in-law.' 

Daughter Dallas. 25. an English literature major, was more con­ cerned about qualifying to drive an ambulance than marrying 
Charles. She is trained to handle 

 the marriage "irretrievably bro­ ken." 
Friends speculate that 
Mrs. 
Talmadge's highly-successful ca­ reer running a country ham busi­ ness, caused the break-up. 
Susan and 
Barry Coldwater 
J r’s marriage was on the rocks before the election. 

But no announcement of their break-up was made until after 
Barry defeated Patti Lear Gor­ man, who ran against him for his 
Congressional seat. 

Patti’s husband, Congressman 
Jam es 
Corman promised he would divorce her if she became a candidate Patti. 46. says she was the victim of the old double standard 

Corman warned his wife to keep the divorce quiet till after the election, even though he pre­ sented her with a four-page blue­ print for divorce as soon as she became a candidate. 

"Susan Coldwater did what I was supposed to do," Patti says. 
“Waited until after the election. 
They did the smiling couple rou­ tine." 

Nadine 
Eckhardt, estranged wife of Texas congressman Bob 
Eckhardt, blames Congressional staffs “for totally pushing out the wife." 

Mrs. Richardson Preyer, happi­ ly married and current president of the Congressional Wives Club, agrees. 

"There are power-groupies al­ ways ready to make themselves available to a politician." 

In many cases the wives' suspi­ cions have been proved right. Be­ sides Don Riegle, there are sever­ al 
Congressmen married to former staffers, including 
Jim najority

Russell Long.

Congresswoman Martha Keys divorced her Kansas husband and quickly remarried divorced fellow 
Congressman Andrew Jacobs of 
Indiana. 

Her political opponent said she would nave divided loyalties and implied she had terrible political judgment in getting a divorce 
She won anyway 

Whatever the reason for the ej>- idemic of Washington divorces, there is help available. 

According to Washington psy­ chiatrist Dr. William Thompson: 
"There are more ways of getting into trouble here, and they are likely to be more sensational " 

Family counselor Lori Eisen- berg believes President C arter’s warning about the danger to fami­ ly life will also be a help. 

"No other president has taken the time or interest to point out how important a father is to his family and the harm that will re­ sult when the father loses Interest in the lives of his children and his wife, * she said. “ He has done his staff a great service in a very nice and kind way."

Later on, I also learned that, had I gone to school, the cheer­ leaders (of which I was one) were asked to go down for a job inter­ view that could lead to a Saturday modeling job at a local depart­ ment store.

TAXI SERVICE 
Many people spend much time and money making connections between their homes or business­ es and local airports 
An airport taxi service puts money in your pocket, lets you work as much or as little as you want and allows you to set your own hours. 
This is how it works A client calls to see if you can have him at the airport tomorrow by 4 p.m. 
You’re at his house by 2.3o on his flight day. You drive him to the airport in his own car. This way you do not have to fuss with extra insurance payments required when you use your own car as a taxi. 
You drop him off with time to spare and return his car to his garage. Meantime, you’ve agreed on arrangements for picking him up on his return flight. 
And you meet him when he re­ turns. He gets to and from the air­ port in his own cat. without wait­ ing for expensive taxis and you get a good income. 
An ad in your local paper will draw your first few customers, then by word-of-mouth. 
The airport taxi service must be reliable. So keep careful records 
You'll need a large desk calendar to pencil in dates and times. You might want to use a pegboard to organize your clients’ garage keys.

Roots author tells Johnny Carson: your ancestor sold himself into slav 

By GEORGE GORDON 
ROOTS author Alex Haley, descendant of an African slave, has startled Johnny Carson — by revealing that 
Carson is the descendant of a slave, too. 
Haley told Carson: Your original ancestor in America was a broke Englishman so anxious to get here he sold himself into slavery. 
The whole story was in a book the black author gave 
Carson on the Tonight Show — 
Roots Of Johnny Carson, A Trib­ ute To A Great Entertainer, by 
Alex Haley. Carson sat up half the night reading the book. 
“I couldn’t put it down. I was absolutely fascinated,” 
Carson said. 
Haley had asked the Institute of 
Family Research in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, to research Carson s ancestors before the show. 
‘‘We put 15 people on it and tied it up in three nays,” Mick Stanger of the Institute told THE STAR 
“The cost was more than $5,ooo and it took Carson’s lineage back to 1541 in England.” 
The story the Carson book told was as interesting, in its way, as the one in Roots. It included an ancestor freezing with George 
Washington at Valley Forge, rela­ tive against relative in the Civil 
War, and pioneers sweeping west­ ward on prairie schooners. 
In fact, the slave in Johnny Car­ son’s family came to America nearly IOO years before Haley’s 
African ancestor, Kunte Kinte, was brought here as a captive aboard a slave ship 
He was Thomas Hooke, bom in 
Middlesex, England, about 1645 
The sailing ship Goulden Wheat 
Sheaf brought him here, and to pay his passage, he indentured himself as a bond slave to Capt 
James Commaway, the ship's master. 
Thomas was a slave in the 
Maryland colony for nine years before being freed and settling in the colony’s Prince George Coun­ ty to raise a family. 
He died prosperous, leaving a crop of tobacco, cattle, pigs, hors­ es, money and other property. 

Some of Johnny Carson s ancestors: James and Virginia Eller Hook (seated! and their children and grandchildren in 1893. 

Dr. Daniel Hook of Georgia: On 
Johnny’s Confederate side. 
Sarah Lyle Hook: She was John­ ny’s great-great-grandmother. 
Johnny Carson on TV as Aunt 
Blabby : His roots fascinated him. 

J 

Thomas’s grandsons James and 
John settled in Frederick County, 
Md , and James became a planta­ tion owner and slaveholder. 
In the Civil War, James's de­ scendants were to fight for the 
Confederacy. 
John’s 
— from whom Johnny Carson is descend­ ed — fought for the Union 
James’s side of the family dropped the *‘e” from the Hooke name but continued to pass on 
“James” as a first name to succeeding generations of males. 
One of the original James’s de­ scendants, Capt, James Hook, bom in 1749, commanded a com­ pany of the Virginia Militia in 
1775 and — family tradition says 

‘This family is America at its finest’ 

— was with George Washington at 
Valley Forge in 1777 78 
A Hook family mansion still stands on the old Hook plantation in Maryland's Potomac Hills. 

The present mansion was built by James Samuel Hook in 1812 over the site of an original man­ sion where another James Hook died in the basement in 18o2. his head resting on the family Bible. 
Sometime in the 18oos, the John

 that men write to 
Charlie’s 
Angels 
Jaclyn Smith strikes a smile on her four-poster bed at her home near Los Angeles. 

By ADAM EDWARDS 
JEW ELRY, trinkets, passionate letters of love, and others of lust, pour in daily to the beautiful stars of TV’s Charlie’s Angels. 
Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Rate Jackson and Ja­ clyn Smith have sparked an avalanche of fan mail unprecedented by any other personality on televi­ sion. 
Bert Garwood, executive coordinator of the smash-hit show, told THE STAR: “We thought we had a winner, but we never thought it would be­ come this popular. 
“The fan mail is the real proof (rf the show’s success. They receive over 33,ooo letters a month. 
“We need a dozen people working full-time to answer their mail.” 
The letters which arrive at 2oth Century Fox in 
Los Angeles cover all age groups, from every walk of life and every occupation And they’re not all from men, either. “Many wives write in want mg pictures for their husbands,” said Garwood. “Girlfriends want pictures for their boyfriends.’’ 
Many of the letters are sexy, but always wholesome, said one of the people who sorts the mail 
They are passionate, but never pornographic Writers often fan­ tasize themselves living with one of the girls, like this one from a 
New Jersey man: 
“I dream of being Lee Majors, and having Farah come home to cook for me, and smile at me across the table. . 

Rate Jackson, often called the “brainy Angel,” brushes up on a few of her lines in her trailer. 
YOU WON’T BELIEVE 
WHAT THEY 
WRITE TO FARRAH 
Or this one: “I wish I could be there to comfort Jaclyn Smith when she is threatened with dan­ ger . . .” 
One 9<kyear-old wrote to the girls, saying how much he loved the show and swore his undying love. Another man, a 48-year-old businessman said he was very moved by Jackie’s statement that she was looking for her ideal man, and made her an offer. 
"I am good-looking, and smart,” he wrote. “ And I can give you comfort and luxury for the rest of your life. You won’t be sorry.” 
One STAR reader, who asked us to forward this “open letter" to the three girls, wrote: 
“Dear Farrah, Rate and Jack­ ie You are my dream women I can think of nothing else all day but you. How beautiful, how sexy, how sultry you all are. 
"As I toil in my grey office, you are my visions of loveliness that bring color into my life. But though you ail turn me on, I must be honest and admit that it is you 
Rate I truly love. 
“ I want to run my fingers through your hair, hold you tight, kiss you on your glistening lips, and make tender love to you. 
“Although I am only a clerk, women find me very attractive, I know you would like me and could 

 learn to fall in love with me 
And then there was this poem from an anonymous bncklayer in 
Ohio: 
Charlie's Angels are my life, 
For anyone of you I d swap my wife. 
Although she is a wonderful mate, she can't give me what you could, Rate. 
My old lady cooks real good 
But I could live on love with you Jaclyn—I really could 
And you Farrah, you mean even more, 
I would much rather have you 
Riss me goodbye at the door. . . 
Farrah 
Fawcett-Maiors, the number one pin up girl and best known of the trio, finds she has a big following among little boys. 
That can't all be sexual, can it?” she asks 
The boys get on the phone with a deep voice and say: “This is 
James with the William Moms 
Agency ” 
"They’re smart these little kids,’’ said Farrah "I’d say to them that it’s wrong to say you’re someone you’re not. And then I d say, 'I love you, you’re the most beautiful person rn the world.’ 
Bul other times, fans are not so complimentary 
She said: 

"Somebody’s always at you for something. When I go to the mar­ ket with my hair undone, men come up and say Oh, no, what’s happened to your hair?’ 

“And what do you say to a woman who has been waiting since 6:3o in the morning for an autograph — go away?” 
Farrah is the only married An 
S hut fans don’t bother husband 
Majors who has had his own difficulties with admirers for years, as TV’s Six Million Dollar 

Farrah however, did admit that when she first began to do the show, husband 
Lee showed twinges of jealousy 
"Lee’s ideal set up would have me going to work with him every day, being with him every second," she said 
The way I see it, the marriage would end in two months at that rate." 
Jackie Smith says she can't un­ derstand all the fuss that’s being made about herself and the other two Angels. 

"I really have to laugh, because there are millions of beautiful girls around," she said. 

"All men don't think I’m pretty and all women certainly dont. 

I’m not in the Raquel Welch league, anyone can see that.” 
In addition to the many thou­ sands (rf letters that pour in, there are others things. Secretary Gail 
Methvin who deals with much of the fan correspondence told THE 
STAR: 
“We get a lot of cheap jewelry and stuffed animals, T-shirts and things like that. 
"This week, a 12-year-old boy sent in his teddy bear to give to the girls —- he had owned it since he was a year old.” 
High school fans write in asking the Angels to pick the prettiest 
E rl in their class. Others ask the 
•roines to meet their sick chil­ dren or to make persona) visits at local events 
The Angels’ shooting schedule is so time-consuming that they have little spare time for them­ selves and usually they refuse these requests. 
But some letters are so touch mg they are impossible to turn down. (Me little boy wrote to Far­ rah “All my friends laugh at me 

 because I am in love with you. 
“They said if I wrote to you and asked for a picture and an auto­ graph you would not write back because you are busy and stars never write back.” 
The letter was carefully sealed and addressed to Phara Pharcet 
Magor. Farrah made a point of personally autographing a picture and sending it to him. 
Gail 
Methvin says she is amazed at the amount that contin­ ues to pour into the office. 
“ When I first started dealing with the show, I used to read most of it. Now there is so much I just send it straight on to the fan mail company.” 
Gail said although there were some critical letters, mainly di­ rected at the girls’ acting abili­ ties, there were few dirty or downright nasty notes. 
Most of the fans are innocent admirers 
She recalled another touching letter: 
“I’m a big fan and I wished I looked like you,” 1o-year-old Man- dy Johnson wrote to Farrah. 
“ I think you’re beautiful and my two best friends at school think you are beautiful as well. 
Will you be my pen pal?” 
And then there is this one, from 
Mrs. Jane Bruce of Illinois who wrote asking for an autographed picture for her husband. 
"My husband thinks Charlie’s 
Angels are fantastic, and I would like to give him a photograph of the three of you for his birthday.” 
And this from David El worthy from Ohio: “ All the guys on the factory floor think you’re the best thing we’ve ever seen on teievi sion We d sure appreciate a pos ter to help us get through our day ” 
Aaron Spelling, who financed and conceived the series with his 
B riner Leonard Goldberg, gave i explanation of the public's love for Charlie s Angels. 
“We don't have the best scripts, we don t have the three best ac tresses rn the world, and the show is not believable. But this is not what the senes is about Ifs sheer entertainment ” 
And he added this story, which sums it all up: A high-powered producer friend of his commented after he watched the show for the first time: “The dialogue is terri­ ble, the script is terrible — but if you turn it off ITI kill you.”

By IVOR KEY 
THE wife of superstar singer 
Bob Dylan told this week how he forced her out of their $2.5 million home so he could live there with his girlfriend. 
Petite Sara Dylan, 34, who has filed for divorce, says he ordered her to leave the house last month after he brought in another wom­ an. 
Sara, who has since won a tem­ porary court order allowing her to return, also claimed that the world-famous folk singer had: 
• HIT her in the face and sub­ jected her to a torrent of physical and emotional abuse; 

Hie Dylan dream borne: The singer spent two years having the cliff-top mansion with its 
Taj Mahal dome and huge swimming pool reconstructed. Now he's had to move out. 
Wonder woman rides upside-down on an airplane’s wing 

FLY (NG wonder woman Myrt 
Strong has a new career — and it’s really taking off. 

The 36-year-old housewife spe cializes in riding on the wing of an upside-down aircraft 
She took her first wing ride be­ fore 1oo,ooo people at a fly-in at 
Wittman Field in Oshkosh, Wise. 
“ It was extremely exciting,” said Myrt “ I was scared and nervous, but I think riding a mo­ torcycle is even more nerve- wracking ’* 

Myrt has made 3o parachute 

 jumps and ridden a hot air bal loon Her husband, Ted manufac­ tures parachuting equipment 

“The hardest part is weather­ ing it’ down at tne bottom of the loop,” said Myrt as she prepared for another wingtop ride 
“The plane is flying about 165 m p h. at an altitude of 15oo feet I stand straight up on the wing and wave as much as I can to the crowds when the plane is at the top of the loop.” 

Myrt wears a back brace but no parachute because if it opened prematurely, there is a good chance the plane would crash 

“The neatest part is when you’re upside down It’s more re­ laxing,” she said. 

 vy to belt everyxmng oelow you It is a bit like being free ” 

Pilot Wayne Pierce, 36, asked r 
Myrt if she would like to ride the wing of his Spearman biplane when his wife, Sandi, decided I she d had enough 

“ Sandi had been doing it for eight years and had accumulated some 45 hours of wing time,” said 
Myrt, who lives in Marshfield, 1 
Mass 

“ When Wayne called me, I said, 
Great, ITI do it,’ but ITI do it I only with Wayne piloting ” 

• TRIED to prevent her from seeing their five children while he dined in the house with the other woman; 
• ADOPTED a bizarre lifestyle and became quarrelsome and menacing toward her. 
Sara, who married Dylan at the height of his fame 12 years ago in 
New York, said the other wom­ an’s name is Malka. 
She told a Los Argeles court: 
“I found her unexpectedly sitting at the breakfast table on Febru­ ary 22 with my husband and in the company of the children. She was apparently enjoying herself.” 
Four days later, Sara said Dy­ lan ordered her to leave the cliff- top Taj Mahal-style mansion at 
Malibu, Calif., and take the chil­ dren with her. 
They are Maria, 15, from a pre­ vious marriage, Jesse, ll, Anna,

Sara, a former fashion model and actress, told the court in a statement that Dylan wanted her out of the house so he could live there with Malka. 
“I was in such fear of him that 
I locked doors in the home to pro­ tect myself from his violent out­ bursts and temper tantrums,” she said “On February 13, he struck me in the face, injuring my jaw 
“My five children are greatly disturbed by the behavior of the 
I respondent and his bizarre life-

A NEW drug treatment is bring­ ing hope of a cure to millions of acne sufferers. 
The drugs, vitamin A acid and benzoyl peroxide, have had dra­ matic results in clearing up the blemishes that affect 8o percent of all adolescents as well as many adults. 
Dr. Jack Kramer, a Los An­ geles skin specialist, this week told THE STAR that the two drugs are not new. 
They were once used separately to treat acne, but are now used to­ gether to produce a more darmat- ic result in a shorter time. 
“ Patients are seeing almost im­ mediate improvement and within just a few weeks, are now almost totally free of blemishes,” he said. 
Kramer said the drugs also made treatment cheaper than oth­ er methods. 
Dr. Alan Shalita, head of der­ matology at Down State Medical 
Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. said the drugs had actually been used to­ gether for about four years. 
“ It s just that more dermatolo­ gists know about them now, whereas they were not used abun­ dantly a few years ago.” he said. 
He said that the drugs were usually extremely effective, but hesitated to call them a cure. 
“There is no real cure for acne,” he said. 
“ We aren’t even totally sure of the cause 
“We know now that chocolate or other foods don’t cause the problem.” he continued. “ And we do know that hormonal increases, especially around the time of ado­ lescence do cause the excess oil secretions that help create the blemishes. 
“ At times, it has been found the birth control pills can regulate these secretions in women, but of course, we cannot give these to adolescent boys ” 
Dr. Shalita cautioned that the drugs should be used under a doc­ tor’s supervision. 
“They aren’t dangerous, but they can irritate the skin if you apply the wrong dosage," he said 
“Vitamin A acid comes in a creme, liquid or gel,” he added. 
“The benzoyl eroxide is usually used in a gel form. 
"Both are applied to the skin in a thin film by the tip of your fin ger. 
“The drugs can be used on al­ ternate days, or one can be ap­ plied in the morning, the other at night ”

57 HIDDEN MEANINGS IN YOUR DREAMS 

 tit 

DREAMS are the real you. 
They are expressions of your subconscious that can reveal your innermost hopes and fears, joys and desires. 
But, because dream s come from the subconscious, they are often confused and distorted. 
You must learn the keys to the dream codes of your subconscious 
; to understand your dream s. 
The following is one explanation of what the various symbols in your dream s mean. 
Some dream doctors do not ac­ cept the meanings listed below j 
They feel each dream er has his own, individual dream code. 
But other doctors believe that various dream symbols have ge­ nerally universal meanings. 
The following dream symbol meanings are a composite of the dream theories of doctors who be­ lieve dream symbols have univer­ sal meanings. 
To use this chart, first try to as­ sess which was the most im portant dream symbol in your dream . 
Then, look up the person, place, sound or event in the list below. 
Compile a list from several dreams. In this way you can build up a picture of the person you really are. 
Dreams of 
PERSOHALITY 
JNB BK ACH: To dream that you are on a beach or with sand all around you is a sure sign that ou have little to worry about in ife. Your subconscious mind is at peace. 
You have a confident, contented outlook on life. You deal with life's problems firmly and quickly, then forget them. 
© 
BIRDS: You have a sensi­ tive, im aginative nature, but not a very realistic or practical one You are inclined to Wipe for the best (rather than do anything really concrete to help yourself) and to put off 'til tomorrow things that should be done today. g jm CLIMBING: To dream that you are climbing, perhaps a mountain, a ladder or simply a flight of stairs is a sign of a rather vain and very ambitious nature. It is also a sign that vanity and am ­ bition are still unsatisfied 
Try to curb your vanity and do something abcxit achieving your ambition 
A 
CHILDHOOD: To dream of y w your childhood or schooldays is a sign of character weakness, but only you can know what form it takes in waking life. 
It may be that you have a job in­ volving too much responsibility, and you shirk responsibility. It may be that you feel insecure in 
B ur work or love life It may be it you crave affection. 
COOKING: To dream that you are cooking is a sure sign of a rather aggressive person­ ality. The cooking you do in your dreams is a sublimation of the an­ ger and aggression you feel in ev­ eryday life. Ask yourself why? 
CYCLING: 
To dream you are riding a bicycle is the sign of a hesitant, uncertain na­ ture. Just as you turn the pedals round and round rn dream s, so you turn your problems over and over in everyday life 
You will find life happier and 

See dream 6 

 smoother if you face up to and deal with each problem imm e­ diately as it arises. 
O 
DOORS: In your dream you are in a large room with doors all around you. Or in a long corridor with doors opening on ei­ ther side. But you don't know which door to try. This dream , like a dream of childhoor ro school­ days, reveals a sense of insecurity. 
Even if you don’t realize it in ev­ eryday life, you are searching for affection. Try offering affection in­ stead. 
© 
EATING: To dream that you are eating m eans that you are hungry — but not for food! 
There is something in you which has not yet realized its full poten­ tial. You are hungry for something 
— perhaps knowledge, perhaps promotion at work, perhaps love. 
# 
FIELD: You are in the mid­ dle of a field or some other wide, open space. Alone, with no one near. Sim ilarly, in waking lite, you are the sort of person who wants to be left alone, who prefers the quiet and solitude of the coun­ t y to the hustle and bustle of the city, who longs only for peace and tranquility. 
JNB FLOATING: To dream that 
H ir you are drifting on the sur­ face of a stream or floating 
(though not actually flying, which means something different) through the air is another sign of a loner personality, someone who seeks peace and quiet from life. 
But it goes further than the dream of open space. ?. m eans al­ so that you avoid responsibility, shirk decision-making, lack am bi­ tion, will do almost anything to avoid an argum ent 
# 
FLOWERS: 
A dream of flowers (not to be confused with a dream in which you are ac­ tively gardening) is a sign of a quiet and tranquil personality. 
You will get the best out of life if you live in peaceful surroundings and surround yourself, as much as possible, with beautiful things. 
© 
GLASSES: 
The sort you drink out of, not the type you wear. To dream of glasses, cups, jugs, or any form of container, to dream that you are pouring liquid, all these are the dream s of the idealist. 
You want the world and life to be more perfect than they really are, but you will find happiness and satisfaction by helping othei s, by bringing happiness into the lives of those around tliein. 
JBK GOLD or MONEY in your 
I g r dream s is a sure sign of an acquisitive, possessive nature. But not necessarily an ambitious na­ ture. You want to own things and possess people. Try not to. 

€|B HORSE: This is a dream of 
Iw vanity, the sign of a girl who likes to be the center of attention, a flirt, sexy and extrovert. 
A kangaroo in your dream , on the other hand, m eans almost, but not quite, the reverse. 
Tile last thing you want is to be the center of attention. You prefer to steer clear of the limelight. 
Yours is a self-contained and as­ sured nature. 
R A IN : In your dream , you are out in the rain or bat­ tered by wind. This is not, as you might think, the dream of the nat-

 ural outdoor girl. It is merely a re­ flection of what your subconscious would like to be what you know you are not. 
Deep down, secretly, you long for adventure, the great outdoors or perhaps some m ore sexual ad­ venture. But you feel unable to face up to the physical or emotion­ al risks involved. 
Dreams of 
LOYE 

DRUMS: 
To dream of drum s is a sign that you are falling in love with someone. Or sexually attracted to someone. Or seeking sexual fulfilment. 
It is a dream which can come to anyone of any age, but it is, by its very nature, m ore common to teenage girls and young bachelor 
K ris than to m others of young milles. 
# 
FRUIT: A dream of fruit - any fruit which must be skinned or peeled before it can be eaten — is a sure sign that your emotions are in conflict. Love is the most common cause of such conflict. 
Particularly physical love. Suddenly something has hap- pend to you which has uncovered and revealed strong emotions of which you were hitherto quite una­ ware. 
© 
GARDENING: 
To dream that you are gardening or farming, helping things to grow, is a sign of growing affection with you, yourself 

 t ill w 

See dream 2$ 

There is someone in your life with whom you wish to De more deeply involved — to help them, protect them , caress them , love them. 
JK I HUNTING: A dream of hunt- 
| w ing — even if, in your dream, ou are uncertain of what you are tinting — reveals a deep desire for love. 
It is a dream very common among those who are young and fancy free and means, quite sim- 
B 
, that they are still searching the love they hope will one day be theirs. 
But occasionally it comes to those who are already 

Iii 

 married, and can mean that trou­ ble is in the offing. 
© 
KNIGHT: 
A dream of a knight in shining arm or re­ flects a desire for live, affection, passion, m arriage. Correctly inter­ preted, it can also tell you the type of mate you are seeking. 
If, in your dream , you are the knight, then yours is a dominant, protective personality. What you need in life is a partner you can look after, mother, dominate in the nicest possible way. 
If, on the other hand, the knight in your dream is someone else, then your need is for a dominant, protective partner on whom you can lean. 
J I B HEROISM: You are doing 
W something brave, perform­ ing some heroic feat — stopping a runaway horse perhaps or snatch- 

PETS: To dream of a pet anim al — a cat or dog, per­ haps — is another reflection of the desire for love and marriage. As with the dream of the knight in shining arm or, it can also tell you the type of lover you seek. 
If, in your dream , you are you and the pet is the pet, then you need a partner you can dominate and look after. 
But if it is one of those crazy dream s in which you yourself sud­ denly take on the form of a pet an­ imal, then you need a partner in life who can look after you...someone who can give you the security and affection you wmjj* 
PRISON: 
You dream that

 ing a small child from under the wheels of an oncoming juggernaut. 
Tlus, too, is a dream of love — or, more accurately, of infatuation. 
You are deeply infatuated with someone you know in your heart of hearts is not for you. Fortunately perhaps, they do not seem to re­ ciprocate the feeling you have for them. 
But how you wish they would. 

MOVING HOME: This is a dream which has two forms, both reflecting heartbreak but in very different ways. So you must be careful to distinguish between a dream of moving home and one of moving house. 
If you are moving home — that is, moving fam iliar possessions from one house to another, one 
C ace to another — then you have sen disappointed in love, as you must surely know already. The person you love has let you down, walked out on you, gone off with someone else. 
But if, in your dream , you are moving into a house (or office) with completely different and strange furnishings around you, then it is your own emotions which are undergoing a change. You may not yet be prepared to admit it to 
S raelf, but your subconscious ws all about it. 

D i | 
MUSIC: 
To hear music in 
W your dream s or to see your­ self at a concert usually follows upon real-life involvement in a deeply emotional situation. 
The type of music you hear in your dream reflects your own sub­ conscious attitude to the newfound love that has com e your way. 
Restful, soothing m usk m eans that this new love has brought you happiness and contentm ent. But loud, confused music m eans not happiness and contentm ent, but. worry a ik concern. 

 to be free. So, in real life, you long to be free of som e emotional en tanglement. The prison bars or locked door you see in your dream are your own real-life conflicting emotions — a deep desire not to hurt the feelings of someone else. 
This is a dream which will un­ doubtedly recur, in varying forms, until the dream er ends the emo­ tional conflict within herself. Get over and done with what has to be done. 
€B SEA SHELLS: 
To dream lr that you are looking at or collecting sea-shells reveals an emotional conflict of a different kind. This dream er does not desire to escape an emotional entangle­ ment, lait to start one. 
She is deeply attracted to some­ one she knows, but does not know what to do about it. A shy, retiring nature holds her back. 
This dream , too, will surely re­ cur until such tim e as she over­ comes her natural tim idity, or the person to whom she is attracted makes the first move for her. 

FEAR 

 yoi ha\ 

I tm / 
See dream 25 

A dream of stones reveals the same thing. You m ay be collecting them, tossing them into a deep well or skim m ing them across the surface of the sea. 
W hichever version your dream takes, it points to frustration in love. 

Dreams of 

BALL: To dream of a ball, to dream that you are throwing it high into the air and catching it as* it falls, over arid over again, reflects a strong dis­ satisfaction with everyday life. 
The smoothroundness of the ball 

.See dream 3o 

 symbolizes the endless monotony; the throwing and catching reflects our deep-rooted desire for change and new experience. 
€ 
B BEGGING: To dream that jp you are begging is a sign of a guilty conscience. Something ou have done, some wrong you ve done someone, is playing on your mind. So your subconscious punishes you by humbling you in your dreams. 
€ 
B CIRCLES: 
To dream that lr you are drawing endless cir­ cles on paper, in the dust, at your feet or the sand on a seashore, is a sign of insecurity. 
Perhaps you have taken a new job and are frightened of the extra responsibility involved. 
Perhaps you are worried that the m an in your life is cooling off. 
Certainly som ething is bothering you, making you uncertain, inse­ cure and unhappy. 
C 
IK DOCTOR: 
Don't worry if lr you dream of a doctor 
It doesn’t mean that there is any­ thing wrong with your health 
Your dream s foretell the future only to the extent of the desires and fears of your own subcon­ scious. 
But it does m ean that you are worried, perhaps about your health, perhaps about something quite different. 
The doctor in your dream is a symbol of the help and com fort you feel you need in real life. 

J |B FALLING: This is perhaps the most common of all dreams of fear and doubt. You are tumbling out of an aircraft, from the window of a skyscraper or over the edge of a rocky ledge. 
Down, down and down you plunge in a fall without end. 
It is a dream with nightm arish qualities from which you may wake up sweating, exhausted and with a sense of panic. It is a sure 
I sign of a troubled mind Something is very wrong in your everyday 
I life 
£$% KNITTING: Or some simi- lur handicraft m eans that j something has happened to give you an inferiority complex. You 

 are becoming frightened that oth­ er people either do not like you or have no respect for you as a per­ son. 
The probability is that it isn’t true and life will be much happier for you once you realize the fact. 
© 
MARRIAGE: 
You dream that you are being m arried. 
But it is no ordinary m arriage. 
You may have a bridegroom standing on each side of you. Or you may be one of two brides standing either side of the bride­ groom. 
Both dream s are a sign of doubt. 
To have two bridegrooms means that you are not sure of your own feelings. 
To be one of two brides m eans that you are jealous and uncertain of the man in your life. 
C 
B RUNNING: This is another 
W dream which can turn into a nightmare. You are running for your life, desperately, breathless­ ly, almost exhausted. Or perhaps you are fighting or struggling with someone or some thing. You are terribly frightened and wake up, usually, sweating and exhausted. 
To end the dream , you m ust face up to your fears and either see them for what they are or try to do something about them . 
© 
SKULL: To dream of a skull usually follows upon some personal tragedy or deep disap­ pointment in real life. As you over­ come your feelings of grief or dis­ appointment, so will the dream fade.o 
TELESCOPE: 
In your 
JR dream you seem to be look­ ing at things through a telescope, magnifying glass or pair of field glasses 
In consequence, every­ thing is larger than life size. 

See dream 35 

Your mind is troubled about something. But, deep down, your subconscious knows that you have got things out of perspective and is warning you in your dream s. 
© 
WINDOWS: You are, wheth­ er you realize it or not, deep- 
I ly frustrated. It m ay be a practical frustration... per haps because things are not going well at work. 
I It may be an emotional frustra- 
! turn. 
Whatever it is. you have been keeping your feelings — perhaps of love, perhaps of anger — too tightly bottled within you. 
Dreams of 

I 
DESIRE 
€ 
B BALLET: To dream you are 
IF at the ballet or dancing in a ballet, or simply dancing, reveals an innocent enough desire. It is the desire to be liked by others, to be wanted, to be popular. Almost cer- 

See dream 38 

 tainly you have a rather shy, with­ drawn nature. You do not mix readily; do not make friends easi­ ly. But oh! how you wish that you did. 
To dream that you are at some grand ball or social function — that you are perhaps the belle of the ball — also reveals a hidden desire to be wanted; to be popular. 
In particular, you would like to be popular with the opposite sex. 
There is, even if you are not pre­ pared to adm it it, a desire for sex­ ual fulfilment buried somewhere deep in your subconscious. 
€ 
B EXPLOSION: 
You see a 
IF great explosion in your dream. A bridge or building is blown sky-high. Or a hydrogen bomb detonates in the atm osphere. 
So you would like to explode on the stage of life: be the center of attention: have everyone adm ire and flatter you. 
This is a dream of complete vanity and egotism. 
But sup­ pressed vanity. 
The answ er to it is to let your­ self go, be as extroverted as your subconscious desires, dress a bit more sexily , flirt with a few men. 
# 
FURNITURE: 
You dream that you are filling a room with furniture. Not setting it out neatly. But simply stuffing it any old way. Or throwing books into a box. 
This is a dream which reveals extrem e dissatisfaction with life. 
You feel that in some way - per­ haps sexually, perhaps financially 
- you are not getting what you should out of life. And what is dis­ satisfaction, if you reverse the pic­ ture, but desire. 
You desire something you haven’t got - money, sex, power. 

 complete sexual fulfilment. 
In your dream you are in a street or some public place - either naked or in the act of removing your clothes. People are watching you. 
You feel an acute sense of shame, but also a strange sense of excitement. You know you are shocking them and you delight in it. 
The m ixture of sham e and ex­ citement you feel in your dream reflect the suppressed desires of your ordinary life. 

PARENTS: To dream of one or other - perhaps both - of your parents is another sign of vanity. You want to get on in life, to be somebody, to be noticed. 
# 
READING: To dream that you are reading a book, magazine or newspaper reveals a combination of desire and guilt. 
You desire to get on in life and know you have the ability to do so. 
You feel guilty because you are, at the moment, wasting that abili­ ty, either lazing your way through life or concentrating upon having a good time. 
# 
SINGING: 
To dream that you are singing, either to oth­ er people or simply to yourself, is another sign of repressed vanity and the secret desire to be the center of attention. 
WANDERER: 
You dream that you are a w anderer - some sort of hobo or hitchhiker. Or perhaps you are a traveler cover­ ing long distances, visiting strange lands, seeing strange sights. 
All such dream s reveal a combi­ nation of frustration and desire. 
You desire to be free. free from

HEIGHT: 
To dream that you are high up, right above the rest of the w orld, per haps on a skyscraper or m ountain .is another dream of extrem e vanity and frus­ tration. You, too, desire to be no­ ticed; to be the center of atten­ tion; to have others, particularly the opposite sex, flock around. 
© 
LAUGHTER: 
To hear friendly, encouraging laugh­ ter in your dream is nothing to worry about. But to hear loud, mocking laughter is a sign that you are repressing your natural sexual instincts, perhaps rightly, perhaps wrongly. 
Such laughter, if you are single. 
; reveals a hidden desire for sexual experience. If you are m arried, it reveals a desire for extra m arital sexual experience. Before indol mg in that, you should ask your se what is wrong with your m arriage and try to put it right.

J I B WOOL: You dream that you 
Mlir are winding wool, coiling rope or something sim ilar. This, too, is a dream of desire but Quite a different type of desire to alf the others mentioned. 
You do not desire, money, sex­ ual fulfilment, revenge or to be the center of attention. You desire only peace and quiet, solitude, to be left alone. 
You feel that life dem ands too much of you, that other people ex­ pect too much from you. But does it really? Is life to blame, or does the fault lie with you? Think about it carefully. 
Dreams of 
CONTENTMEHT 
C 
B BELUS: To dream that you w an* listen mg to the sound of distant bells is a sure sign of a tranquil, carefree contented state of mind You are at peace with the world, either because things have 

 gone well for you recently or be­ cause of things still to come which your subconscious mind is antici­ pating with pleasure. 
© 
CURTAINS: In your dream 
— hanging at a window or dividing a room in two — is anoth­ er sign of a hapny and contented fram e of mind. But if you yourself, in your dream s, are actually hang­ ing or drawing curtains, then there is also a slight elem ent of doubt in your subconscious 
FLYING: To dream that you are flying 
(not floating) through the air — perhaps in an airplane, perhaps under your own volition like a bird — is another sign of elation. 
You are happy — not so much contented as excited — over some­ thing that has just happened or something you know or feel is about to happen. The faster you fly, the greater your subconscious sense of excitement. 

4KB

To dream that you are receiving or sending a letter is another sign that all is well with your particular world. 
You are happy and contented with life. 
# 
JUM PING: In your dream you are jumping up and down with excitem ent. 
Perhaps you are a child again 
You feel wildly and deliriously happy. And so you are — in real life as well as in your dream 
But in real life, because of the type of person you are or for rea­ sons best known to yourself, you refrain from displaying and ex­ pressing the happiness you feel. So your subconscious does it for you in your dream s. 
JBK SAND: 
You are running through sand Or sifting it la­ zily through your fingers It feels soft, w arm 
You feel happy; at peace. 
And so you are. But not because you do not have any problems in iife. 
Like most people, you have your worries and doubts. But you are the type of person who never wor­ ries unnecessarily. 
Your worries are real worries, small perhaps, but real. You face up to them ; do something about them ; then put them I irmly behind you and forget them. 
© 
TWINS: It may be that, in your dream s, you give birth to twins. Or perhaps you simply see them — two anonymous, un­ known children or grownups who are the spit image of each other. 
Both dream s m ean the sam e — a reflection of the contentment and happiness you feel in your waking life 
JIB WRITING: To dream that 
V you art1 writing or typing is another sign of a contented and tranquil mind Bul only so long as the writing or typing flows contin­ uously and easily 
If, in your dream , your pen m akes a big blot on the paper or your typewriter jam s, then some hidden doubt or worry m ars the contentm ent you know you should feel 
COLORS: 
Most people 
MhP dream only in black and white or indeterm inate shades of grey. But some dream in color. 
For those who do, to dream that they art* writing or typing on blue paper — or, indeed, any other dream in which the color blue predom inates — is a sure sign that they are enjoying almost every moment of life and getting the most out of it And they know it! 

A GREAT NEW WEIGHT WATCHERS 

By CHRISTINA KIRK 

WEIGHT WATCHERS’ revolutionary new diet, unveiled in THE STAR early this year, has caused a sensation among dieters. 
It has been hailed as the Break­ through Diet of the Decade. 
Millions couldn’t believe their eyes when they read that the world-re­ nowned Weight Watchers organization was listing hot dogs, corn on the cob and hamburgers as foods you could eat on a lose-weight program. 
THE STAR'S publication of a full 7-day menu and recipes from the new Weight 
Watchers' plan resulted in thousands of phone calls and letters. 
Not only were readers congratulating us and Weight Watchers. They wanted more of the same. More menus. More recipes. 
Now, after negotiations with Weight 
Watchers, we are delighted and proud to announce that they have agreed to share more of their exclusive new formula with readers of THE STAR. 
This week we publish another full 7-day 
Menu planner, with Weight Watchers’ rec­ ommendations for Morning, Midday and 
Evening Meals — and morning and eve- 

SEVEN-DAY MENU 
WITH REGPES 

SPECIALLY FOR STAR READERS 

 rang snacks. It is printed on the other side of this, making a page you will want to keep for the whole family. 
Below, giving you a doubled-sided diet treat, is a new selection of Weight Watch­ ers recipes that fit into the 7-day Menu. 
These recipes bring a new dimension and a new thrill to dieting. The bread-and water days are gone forever. Why, there’s even a recipe for a Weight Watchers Piz­ za — and Lose-Weight Beef Chop Suey. 
The 7-day Menu planner overleaf fea­ tures such tasty and “legal’ dishes as brie cheese, poached salmon, creamed com, roast leg of lamb, broiled scallops, lemon yogurt sherbet — and hot chocolate. 
They are all on the new liberalized diet 

 plan Weight Watchers has devised for its thousands of members. 
You can eat everything on the week’s menu and still keep within the daily 1,2oo calories limit for women and daily 1,5oo calorie range for men. 

However, if you are using the recipes only as an addition to your own low-calorie diet, you must remember to substitute these once-forbidden foods for an item or items with an equal number of calories. 
Equivalent amounts are given with each recipe. 

Tile new Weight Watchers plan still al­ lows dieters to lose the 2 to 2 4 pounds a week recommended by the American Med­ 

 ical Association. And like its predecessor, it provides all the essential nutrients. 
But it permits the dieter a greater varie­ ty in food choices which Weight Watchers motivational experts believe makes it eas­ ier to stick to the weight-loss plan. 
Despite all the tasty dishes that come with this program, many dieters may find 
— as dieters find again and again — that, after dropping several pounds, they will suddenly stop losing weight. 

This is the point at which the faint-heart­ ed frequently give up. But Weight Watch­ ers have their own action program for this situation — they call it their Plateau Plan. 

Next week in THE STAR we will show you how it works, so that you can over­ come the dieters’ most frustrating hurdle, should the need arise. We will also be talk­ ing to Weight Watchers’ founder, Jean Ni- detch — who will be letting you in on HER favorite recipes from the revolutionary new diet program. 

And that’s not all. THE STAR has ar­ ranged to give you a three week program of Weight Watchers’ exclusive and highly- sought after new ideas. On the third week we will show you how to maintain a slim figure once you have achieved it. 
Now — get in trim for Spring.

Rock is ready to tun in his badge 

$ t i 
Sammy Davis: Mad as heil. 

Flip Wilson: Wisecracks. 
Sammy and 
Flip feuding 

IS IT true that Flip Wilson and 
Sammy Davis Jr are feuding? — 
(Yaig Ailey, Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
MUCH truth. It seems that at a recent benefit show Flip told a se­ ries of jokes about Sammy which 
Sammy didn’t find at all amusing. 
The two haven’t spoken since. 
Osmonds axed 

WHY were the Osmonds dropped 

 at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas? 
—Martha Fritz, LaJolla, Calif. 
THE group was packing them in for their show, but most of the au­ dience was teenagers. Too young to spend money on liquor or gam­ ble. which is how the hotels make their money. 

IS Rock Hudson going to be re­ turning in McMillan next season or is he calling it quits? —Darryl 
Slayter, Mussel shoals, Ala. 
AT the moment, 
Rock hasn’t made up his mind about doing a seventh season of the popular cop show. He’s taken off on a three- week cruise of the Caribbean and told Universal Studios he’ll worry about the show when he returns. 
Tile general opinion is he’ll say no to continuing the show Hard to believe since he’s earned $1.6 mil­ lion for this year’s six segments 
However, Rock doesn't need the money and he’s told friends he’d like to make more movies and de vote his time to what he calls his second favorite profession — play­ ing bridge. 
Burt’s secret 

HOW does Burt Lancaster keep in such great shape? He looks terrif­ ic. —Bob Cutler, Richmond, Va. 
BURT, 63, has been a jogger, swimmer and on again off-again gymnast for 3o years. In fact, he worked as a trapeze artist before becoming an actor. He still jogs a couple of miles a day. 
TV cop’s ambition 

I HEARD that Richard Hatch of 
Streets Of San Francisco didn’t al­ ways want to be an actor. What was his original ambition? —Katy 
Zindel, Boisie, Idaho. 
RICHARD studied piano from the ace of eight and originally intend­ ed to be a classical pianist. Then he took up pole vaulting and for several years wanted to become an Olympic champ. It wasn’t until he was 2o that he even thought about acting 

SELF-DEFENSE FOR WOMEN 

B> Kmil Parkas of the National Self Defense Institute. 

 lf you find yourself suddenly grabbed around the waist, with your attacker making unfriendly advances, use one of your best defensive weapons — your teeth 
Then use this opportunity to run. 

R em em ber — don t be nice. Your attacker is out to harm you, so bite him hard and then run Your opponent will be reluctant to try another attack 

Beatty eyes Congress 

I HEARD that Warren Beatty is planning to enter politics. True? 
—Kevin Matteson, Sacramento, 
Calif. 
WARREN has been denying that rumor for years. Ever since he was so actively involved in the 
1972 McGovern campaign. 
However, he did attend the 
Democratic convention last sum­ mer and has been courting some very influential politicians, includ­ ing 
California governor 
Jerry 
Brown. Word is that Warren’s considering running for Congress in 1978. 

Rocky contenders 

Who were the other stars who wanted to play the fighter in the picture. Rocky? —Don Larney, 
Portland, Ore. 

INSTEAD of using Sylvester Stal­ lone who’d written the script, the producers originally wanted to 
Buy it and have Burt Reynolds 
•star. Also interested in it were 
Ryan O’Neal and Jam es Caan 
An interesting sidelight to Stal­ lone: Henry Winkler of Happy 
Days recently revealed that he patterned Fonzie after Stallone. 
That is, after Stallone’s character in the 1974 movie Lords Of Flat- bush in which Winkler co-starred. 

Nancy’s real name 

IS Nancy Walker’s real name 
Nancy Walker?—Patricia Gilles­ pie, Lexington, Ky. 

NO. The 55-year-old star of TV’s 
Blansky's Beauties has had four names. Her parents were vaude­ ville performers and every time they changed their name she changed hers. 
She was born Anna Swoycr, 
Hello 
Dolly, 

 you’re lookin’ 

 swell... 

ITS the voluptu­ ous 
Rhinestone cowgirl 
Dolly 
Parton, flashing a sexy glance at her fans. 

She was nominated for female vocalist of the year at the 
Country 
Music Awards. 

But this year had to bow to 
Crystal Gayle. 

Still, Dolly just kept smiling through those famous blond!* curls. 

Ifs just like the song says — you’re lookin' good, Dolly. 
LAWMAN COMES CLEAN 

A STATE'S top lawman has con­ fessed to a “crime” — wasting water. 

“I’ve been walking around the last few days with an attitude of shame and embarrassment, think­ ing of all the water I’ve wasted over the years,” said Svelte J. 
Younger, 
Attorney 
General of drought hit California. But Youn 

 then became Anna Carto, then 
Nancy Barto and for the past 35 years, Nancy Walker. 
Tatum won’t quit 

I THOUGHT Ryan O’Neal said his daughter Tatum wasn’t mak­ ing any more movies, but now she’s going to. What gives? Patti 
Michaelis, N.Y. 

NO ONE knows. Last year Ryan said Tatum was retiring until she was 18. I^ast month she signed to star in the love story. Six Weeks. 
The feeling is that Ryan’s disci­ pline over Tatum is sporadic, and one of the reasons she’s known as 
Hollywood’s biggest brat. 

 ger said he has mended his ways 

He now turns off the tap while he brushes his teeth. And, he says, he doesn’t spend hours sing­ ing in the shower, “the only place 
I can gel away with it.” 

Younger and other top officials are considering new laws to deal with future water emergencies 

Jackie’s new 

 date laughs at 

 the mention 

 of a romance 

WRITER Pete Hamill this week laughed off suggestions of a ro­ mance between him and Jackie 
Onassis. 
The couple have been seen to­ gether at several New York res­ taurants and nightspots recently. 
But Hamill, longtime boyfriend of actress Shirley MacLaine, insists that it’s purely a business rela­ tionship 
Everything is the same be- 
Shirley and myself,” he said “Things are fine. Everybody liked everybody. 

“ You are talking about Mrs. 
Jackie Onassis as an editor and 
Pete Hamill as a writer when you see us together. 
“We are good friends and have been for a long time I’ve been suggesting writers and ideas to her.’’ 
A close friend of Mrs. Onassis told 
THE 
STAR that 
Jackie 
“wants and is looking for compa­ nionship — and not just empty friendships.” 

The friend added: “ Pete is part­ ly fulfilling that need at the mo­ ment. but it s nothing serious.” 

Now for the good news... 

THERE are some things to be thankful for in the energy crisis, according to new statistics. 
If the 2o billion kilowatt-hours of electricity produced by nuclear power plants last month had NOT been available, these would have been the sad consequences. 
• More than 257,ooo jobs would have been lost, 
• Nearly $23o million lost in monthly wages, 
• Additionally, the IO million homes, 
I million stores, office buildings and schools; and 6o,ooo factories, industries and plants that could have been served by this nuclear generation would have needed their energy require­ ments met by other means Fill­ ing these demands for electricity by other .sources would have re­ quired

Rich 
Man Billy Abbott is a guy who takes life easy 

JAMES CARROLL JORDAN is just the opposite of the spoiled, ambitious rich kid he plays on TV’s Rich Man, Poor Man. 
In private life he’s an off-beat beach boy who says money won t change him, with a secret girlfriend whose identity he's keeping a secret. jim _ who plays the cocky, wheeler-dealer 
Billy Abbott — lives a free and easy bachelor’s life in a tiny wooden bungalow by the ocean in 
Venice, Calif. 
He shares the cluttered, comfortable house with two actor friends, two enormous Russian wolfhounds, a treasured old Jaguar XK-12o, a leaking waterbed, dartboards, a table tennis table, a huge hi-fi col­ lection. a guitar, old car seats in the front garden, and a skate­ board. 
The skateboard’s important. 
Every day he jumps on it, the dogs grab their leashes, and they hurtle out of the front door, pull­ ing Jim along the road and star­ tling drivers who watch them gal­ lop towards the beach. 
“ You’ve got to try and keep yourself as wild as you can,” Jim said. “ I know ifs difficult, with houses and people all around, but freedom’s very important.” 
A dark-haired handsome 
27-year-old, Jim is proud of the house he bought a year ago. 
He is busy rebuilding and rede­ corating; he has turned a garage into his bedroom but is having problems with a leaking wa­ terbed. 
“ I may not be the world’s greatest handyman, but it s relax­ ing,” said Jim. 
Happy-go-lucky Jim has little in common with hustling Billy Ab­ bott. 
Billy wears sharp suits — Jim prefers shorts and t-shirts or scruffily casual jeans and sweat­ ers. Billy wants to make money 
— Jim doesn’t care about it. 
“If I make money 1 11 spend it on my Jaguar and the dogs,” he said. “I ll buy the dogs Alpo for life." 
But he enjoys playing Abbott. 
“I’m the orneriest villain on TV today,” he says proudly. 

Jim Jordan, an easy-going guy, flexes his 

 ride. him 
Jim's wolfhounds give 

“ I've done five years of episod­ ic television and I ve always been the villain. I noticed that the vil­ lain always had the best part and the best lines.” 
While Jim and his close friend, the other Rich Man heartthrob 
Gregg Henry, enjoy the attention they’re getting from females these days, there s only one girl in 
Angie and Burt team up again - for a date 

IT 

 morning 

Jim’s life at the moment. They steady but he won’t say who s is. And he emphasizes he isn t ready to settle down yet. 
“That will come," he said. “ I believe in marriage I’m going to have twins, I ve decided — a cou­ ple of halfbacks. My dad was a twin so I stand a good chance. 
“ Until then, theres nothing wrong with the old bachelor life. 
"Dogs, darts, the old car, my guitar, the beach — what more could I want?"_________________ 
PATCH OF ICE 
STRUCK TWICE 
A PATCH of ice proved to be dou­ ble trouble for Oliver Bullard Jr. in Hartford City, Ind. 
First, Bullard’s car slid on the ice on Indiana Rte. 26, knocked over a sign and hit a fence, police reported. 
Bullard then went home to get his pickup truck to tow the car 
But as he arrived at the accident site, the truck skidded on the same patch of ice and it cracked into the car. 
He wasn’t hurt. But damage to the car was $3oo and the truck 
$15o.

Angie Dickinson and Burt Bacharach are back together they're still not holding hands. The couple have been working on a Broadway musical, and friends hope that the working relationship will help the couple patch up their marriage. 

CONCLUDING DR. ATKINS 
SUPERENERGY DIET 

C vt 
Ph ou have experienced the ysical and emotional most people feel 

I HOPE great transformation on my diets. 
In case you haven t, let’s con­ sider possible reasons. 
Your problem could be with en­ ergy, weight, or both. 
Here are some reasons you may not have Superenergy: 
There may be hidden sugar in your diet — vitamin C com­ pounds, cough syrups, tartar sauce and many other items con­ tain sugar you may not know about. 
You may be cheating on the diet. Just a few bites can matter. 
You may not be eating enough. 
Eat the right foods until you are satisfied — don’t starve yourself. 
You may not be eating often enough — eat five to six small slacks a day. not one or two large meals. 
You may have a mineral or salt imbalance. Salt deprivation can occur in early stages of my diets. 
You may be allergic to a food or food additive you are eating. 
You may be drinking too much coffee or tea or cola. All these cause release of lasulin with the usual temporary energy lift, fol­ lowed by fatigue and hunger. 
You could be smoking too much. Smoking can prevent cor­ rection of hypoglycemia. 
It could be alcohol. Alcohol stimulates insulin production, and many drinks contain carbohy­ drates. 
It could be drugs you are tak­ ing Aspirin can cause hypogly­ cemia. 
You could have an emotional problem that isn t related to diet. 
Perhaps your problem is not en­ ergy, but weight. If that is the case, here are some reasons you may not be getting the weight re­ sult you want: 
You may be taking in too much carbohydrate. 
This causes the majority of failures. Every single gram makes a difference. 
Too much salt could be causing a retention of water. You may 

 lf your diet isn’t helping, maybe it’s because you are cheating 

 need to exercise more to burn off weight Exercise and proper diet together work miracles. 
You may be reacting from diet pills you were taking. Diet pills affect the appetite. You may be eating too much. 
You may be eating too much even if you've never been on diet pills. Eat less. 
You may have a thyroid prob­ lem. A clinical test is the only way to know 
You could be having a pheno­ menon called Metabolic Resist­ ance to Weight Ix)ss, a little-un­ derstood mechanism of the body. 
This often can occur to people who have been on diet pills. There are several diets which will break this cycle. 
These diets usually involve 
Some fasting or 
«hnrf-tnrrp reduction in eating. I favor a high-fat, low-protein fasting diet, because it satisfies hunger the best. 
In all cases — energy loss or weight gain — remember that this result is not normal. 
The normal response to Diet #1 is weight loss This response is so predictable that if it doesn’t hap­ pen, something is wrong. 
If you completely check out your diet and are sure you are not making any mistakes, see your doctor. 
You could have some underly­ ing physical or emotional problem that needs to be treated.

TV show lets singles tell 

A DARING TV show aimed at sin­ gles looking for partners is a run­ away success in Southern Califor­ nia. 
Dr. Tom Gillette, chairman of the sociology department of the 
University of California at San 
Diego, interviews three guests over the station XETV every night at ll. 
“Some of the things they say are lulus,” Dr. Gillette told THE 
STAR. 
“One woman said she is living in an open relationship — outside affairs permissible — with a guy. 
“ Everything is okay, except he evediently has no trouble picking up girls but she is not in a good spot to meet new men. 
“The guest, who was 29 and very very pretty, appealed to the 
TV audience for names of men 
WRECK-PRONE TRUCKER QUITS 
MALCOLM * Smasher” Waters is a 46-year-old truck driver who has decided to find a new line of work. Waters had an accident-free driving record until three years ago Then he had 15 mishaps in a row The last — demolishing a wall as he tried to make a turn at a traffic light 
— got him fired Now he s going to be a typewriter repairman “ I don’t think I can get into as much trouble doing that,” said Waters of Bir­ mingham, England 

 of sex likes 

 who would like to date her and we were just about buried in letters ” 
Interviews on the show, called 
Singles Matchup, are unrehearsed and unedited. They cover every aspect of the participant’s person­ ality. 
Discussion of sexual prefer­ ences has been so graphic tne sta­ tion is glad it chose the late broadcast hour. 
“One young man spent all his time describing a sex orgy he had taken part in Fairmont, which shocked our viewers mostly be­ cause Fairmont is a super re­ spectable suburb of San Diego, ’ 
Dr. Gillette said 
The sociologist said most people who have appeared on the pro­ gram believe in free sex before marriage — and most of them 
Hunk there should be open sex afterwards 
I 
“One of our guests, a woman. said she was into group sex, bed­ room antics with five or six other people, and invited telephone calls,” Dr Gillette recalled. 
“Our switchboard lit up like a 
Christmas tree.”

Where have all our children gone in this TV age? 

THE NEXT time you walk down the street in your neighborhood, I want you to do what I did the oth­ er day. 
It was a bright Saturday morn­ ing about ll a m. and the Friday night hangover had subsided to where I had everything in single vision. I rarely see the street at that time, having already com­ mitted myself to the agony of commuting to work. 
But this Saturday morning was different. I was at peace with the world and it was a nice sunny day. 
But something was wrong. Un­ mistakeably wrong. Then it hit me. 
W HERE HAD ALL THE CHIL­ 
DREN GONE? 
There were no kids in sight. 
And there was no laughter. And there were no tears. And there were no arguments about who owned the football. 
There were no kids. 
The street was clean, orderly, well kept. But damn it, so order­ ly. There just wasn't that beauti­ ful untidiness of kids. 
I walked back into my house and to my shame, saw the an­ swer. There in front of a goggle­ box called television, there was a

 there,” she said. “ There are bad kids out there,” she said. “ Do you want to turn them into young criminals?” she said 
So the next Saturday morning, there they were, this pair of square-eyed addicts watching the' booby-tube. 
I. in my wisdom, said nothing. 
Who wants a slightly crazed wont­ ing you of dren into Alvin Karpis or Willie an accusing you of turning chil- 

 four-year-old and a ten-year-old mtcmnf closely followed by Isis, closely 
Planet Of The Apes, 

 followed by Shazam. 
In anger I cleared them out, told them gruffly: “ Go out and throw a football, go steal some apples, go get a black eye.” 
Their mother looked at me like 
I had a highly contagious disease. 
“ You don’t,” she said, “ turn them 

Sutton? Not me. 
So, I guess these wretched little monsters will keep on watching apes, and Isis and Shazam unti they become television salesman. 
It probably won t matter in IO years time that they can’t throw a spitball or punt a ball. 
It probably won’t matter that they won’t know who Hank Aaron was or who Joe Namath was. I mean, what television series On a 
Saturday morning did they star in? 
I don’t plav sports very well, but it wasn’t for lack of opportuni­ ty. In the street where I lived you would get up early Saturday morning, eat a giant breakfast and your mother would say some­ thing loving like: “ Please, leave me in peace, go out and play.”

SEI SOLUTION PAGE 19 

Occasionally you would go home crying, holding a swollen eye af­ ter not having enough sense to duck. But after your mother put a wet sponge on it, out you would go again to conquer the world. 

It just doesn’t happen today. 
Between television on Saturday morning, cars on the street and mothers who believe their chil­ dren are going to grow up like Al 
Capone, it just doesn’t happen. 

If I had any power I would ban 
Saturday morning television for kids. Don’t they get enough of it during the week? 

Of course, if I had any more courage, I would ban my children from watching Saturday morning television. But who among us have that much courage when facing a righteous woman? Not I. 

Critics of my argument tell me: 
“ You’re crazy. There are parks and playgrounds for kids to go to.” 

So when I go to parks and play­ grounds, what do I see? 

The same as I see on the streets. Emptiness. No kids, no dogs, no fights. The only kids you ever see in the neighborhoods are little black kids. 

Those families don't have all that many television sets at home 
So there they are on the street playing ball. And maybe that’s why there are, disproportionate to the population, more black kids in the all-American squads. 
They don’t know much about 
Shazam, but they know how to kick a ball. 

We are making our kids a na­ tion of spectators and not a nation 
(rf participants. 

In China, in the Soviet Union, how many kids watch television on a Saturday morning? I don’t know, but I will be brave enough to say: precious damn few. 

I don’t think it is any coinci­ dence that the supremacy of the 
U S at the Olympic Games has withered remarkably in tandem with the softness (rf our kids. 

An average ten-year-old. even in a high-priced private school, does not play football. Twenty years ago they played football when they were seven. 

Little girls don't play any kind of strongly-organized sport until they are 12. 

Have a look at what East Ger­ many does about sports when a kid is five. It annoys me to see the commies stealing a march on us in the very basics of character- building 
Watching the Planet Of The 
Apes, or Isis or Shazam doesn’t build the character to tell kids how to take knocks. 
Throwing a football, or maybe even a punch in the street and 
* ying stickball and playing for a ing side, DOES. 
I wonder how many Saturday morning TV shows Jim Thorpe. or Babe Ruth or Rocky Graziano ever watched? But then again thev were the kind of guys that took Iwo Jim a. 
And our kids are the kind of kids who give those things away 
But, it’s our fault because we don t have enough guts to turn the damn TV off. We deserve all we get

Viewers wage war on the 
2o most violent programs on TV 

GOSSIP 
John Wayne goes back to wife & family 
THE blood and guts scenes of 
TV’s top-rated Starsky And Hutch will be chopped out of forthcom­ ing scripts after a recent survey showed it to be the most violent show on television. 
After a list of the most violent shows on the box by the independ­ ent National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting (NCCB), Star- producer Aaron Spelling of pledged: “ I promise we’re going to take the violence out of 
Starsky And* Hutch. 
“If the ratings slip two points, they slip. But the violence will stop. I promise.’’ 
The “2o most violent shows” are listed as follows with the high­ est rating signifying the most vi­ olent. The figures are based on 

METRIC SYSTEM 

IS A CINCH. SAYS 

A PROFESSOR 

AMERICANS wont have an ounce of trouble catching on to the metric system, says Dr. Kent 
L. Granzin, a professor of market­ ing at the University of Utah. 
They will find it easy to adjust after a short breaking-in penod. 
The metric system is being phased in here over the next IO years. 
Dr. Granzin made his prediction after surveying 2o3 Americans liv­ ing in Madrid. Spain. They live in daily contact with metric weights and measures 
Most of them find the system superior, he said 
Dr. Granzin said he conducted the study to help set the ground­ work for a nationwide campaign to educate Americans on metrica­ tion. 
He said the time has come for metrication in the U.S.

Baretta, 65;

Sheep, 65; Hawaii Five-O, 6o; Six

Barnaby Jones, 38; Streets Of 
San Francisco, 38, Bionic Woman, 
33; 
McCloud/Columbo/Quincy/ 
McMillan. 31; Switch, 3o Next, believe it or not, came The Won­ derful World Of Disney, with a rating of 28. 
After publication of the list, the 
National Association of Broach casters, to which the three net­ works belong, is rewriting its broadcaster’s code to limit the amount of violence. 
NBC President Robert Howard told executives: if the prolifera­ tion of programs whose plot lines heavily involve violence has be­ come excessive.” 
He said the network will veer away from the “hard action form” this season and added that nearly half the new shows pro­ posed are comedy and variety. 
The survey which has had the greatest impact on network pro­ grammers is a study by the J. 
Walter 
Thompson advertising agency,one of tne three largest in the county. Last June it warned clients that advertising on violent shows could be bad public rela­ tions because of growing viewer opposition. 
Last week the agency released details of a new survey which showed 47 per cent felt TV pro­ gramming is getting worse, with 
32 per cent citing “too much vio­ lence” as their main reason. The results of the survey are being distributed to clients with the warning: “There is a danger that products advertised on violent programs may be boycotted by growing numbers of people." 
According to Thompson spokes­ man Gene Secunda 
“The net­ works have heard the signal.” 

John Wayne with his wife Pilar. 

JOHN WAYNE is back with his wife PILAR after a two- year separation. 
Credit for getting the couple — who've been wed 2o years — to­ gether again goes to their daugh­ ter AISSA, 2o. 
The reconciliation came when 
Tbe Duke left girlfriend PAT 
STACEY at home to go vacation­ ing with his son Michael in Matza- lan, Mexico. 
After a telephone call between brother and sister, Aissa persuad­ 

 ed Pilar she too deserved a vaca­ tion — and where better than 
Matzalan. 
She didn’t mention that Wayne was in town, but two days later they all bumped into each other. 
All four went off arm-in-arm to the nearest bar to reminisce and they haven’t been apart since. 
Wayne left the converted submar­ ine chaser he was living on and moved back into their Newport

JAGGER’s wife BIANCA are be­ coming awfully friendly. 
W’hen the aging rock star went off to Europe to negotiate a new

Actress 
LYNN 
REDGRAVE won t talk about her spat with 
JERRY LEWIS which eventually led to the closing down of the musical Hellzapoppin before it got to Broadway. 
But I can tell you the pair argued throughout their short run and once on stage, the British ac­ tress gave Jerry' a belt in the left eye. 
A stagehand dived in from the wings to prevent the petulant co­ median from retaliating. The au­ dience roared. They thought it was part of the script.

OLIVER REED is one of the few hellraisers we have left — or so he would like the public to be­ lieve. Stories are still filtering out of Phoenix, Ariz. where he stayed 
— or rather played — during the making of his new film The Salt 
On Paradise. 
The portly star apparently threw a private security guard, hired by an Arizona socialite for a party, into the swimming pool. 
Reed, who at $1 million-a-movie can now afford these little eccen­ tricities, complained that the cop had been giving him a hard time. 
Reed’s co-star in that film 
DEBORAH RAFFIN made such an impression on 2oth Century 
Fox they have given her a five- year movie contract with her hus­ band MICHAEL VINER produc ing two of them. 
CLINT EASTWOOD attracted a crowd when he put away his guns, packed up some lunch sandwiches and showed up at his bar-restau- rant in Carmel Calif., where ex­ tensions are being carried out. 
The sight of a star actually working lured so manv tourists, guards had to be sent tor to keep them away from Dirty Harry.

SUPERSTAR Marlon Brando has bought two Doberman pinscher dogs to stop fans invading his 
Beverly Hills home. Some intrud ers have even sneaked into the ac tor s bedroom at night. 
Brando bought the guard dogs after his request for a police guard was rejected. 
He said uninvited guests began popping into the home about six months ago. 
He was sitting in his bedroom when the first appeaared. 
The intruder said "he had come to talk to me about God,’’ Brando told THE STAR.

Brando to make love to a girl­ friend who was waiting outside. 
"I reached for a gun which I keep behind the bed for protection but he got away before the police arrived,’’ the actor said. 
Marlon Brando: Home invaded by strangers. 

Dog mugs a woman 

SOMEWHERE, there s a mugger who has taught his dog to do his work for him. 
A woman told police in Swiss­ vale, Pa , near Pittsburgh, she was attacked by a large dog in an alley behind her home. 
After knocking the woman down and breaking her wrist, the ani­ mal carried off her handbag in its mouth. Lost were credit cards, identification and an unknown amount of cash. 
Police Chief Ronald l^es said: 
’i t was a big dog, but the woman said she wouldn't be able to iden­ tify it if she saw it again ”

GEORGE C. SCOTTS intention to leave 
Sly Fox on Broadway next month. Apparently 
Scott (left) told his agent Sam Cohn he was bored with the show and asked him to start looking for film parts. None were forthcoming. 
There was an argument between him and 
Cohn whom he accused of not trying and threatened to fire. The agent is now looking harder than ever. Oh yes, I forgot. Cohn is one
