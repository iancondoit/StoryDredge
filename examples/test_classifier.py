        LOCAL COUNCIL APPROVES NEW BUDGET
        
        By John Smith, Staff Writer
        SAN ANTONIO, JUNE 14 â€” The San Antonio City Council yesterday approved a $24 million budget for the upcoming fiscal year, with increased funding for public safety and parks. Mayor Robert Johnson said the new budget reflects the city's commitment to improving quality of life while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
        
        The budget passed by a vote of 7-2, with Councilmembers Maria Rodriguez and James Wilson opposing the measure, citing concerns about insufficient funding for affordable housing initiatives.
        
        "This budget represents a balanced approach to meeting our city's needs," said Johnson during the council meeting. "We're investing in essential services while keeping tax increases minimal."
        
        The new budget includes a 5% increase for the police department, a 4% increase for parks and recreation, and a 3% increase for infrastructure maintenance. The fiscal year begins on July 1.
        
        Public reaction to the budget has been mixed, with some residents praising the focus on public safety, while others have expressed disappointment about the lack of funding for social programs.
        
        The City Council will meet again next week to discuss implementation plans for the newly approved budget.
