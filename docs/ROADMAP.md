### Next Steps

With the completion of all planned milestones, StoryDredge Version 1.0 is now ready for release. Future work may include:

1. CI/CD pipeline integration
2. Additional model support beyond Ollama
3. Web interface for pipeline management
4. Enhanced visualization of processing results
5. Integration with additional newspaper archives

## Prioritization Guidelines

When implementing components, follow these priorities:

1. **Core functionality first**: Focus on making each component work correctly before optimizing
2. **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Incremental improvements**: Get a basic version working, then enhance
4. **Error handling**: Robust error handling is essential for long-running processes

## Development Dependencies

Milestone dependencies are as follows:

- Milestone 3 → Milestone 2
- Milestone 4 → Milestone 3
- Milestone 5 → Milestone 4
- Milestone 6 → Milestone 5
- Milestone 7 → Milestone 6
- Milestone 8 → All previous milestones
- Milestone 9 → Milestone 8
