LOCAL COUNCIL APPROVES NEW BUDGET

By John Smith

The San Antonio City Council yesterday approved a
$24 million budget for the upcoming fiscal year, with
increased funding for public safety and parks.

Mayor Robert Johnson said the new budget reflects
the city's commitment to improving quality of life
while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

"We're making investments in critical areas while
still keeping tax rates stable," Johnson said during
the council meeting.

The budget includes $8 million for the police
department, a 5% increase from last year, and
$3.5 million for parks and recreation.

Councilwoman Maria Garcia, who represents the
west side, praised the budget's focus on
infrastructure improvements in underserved areas.

The budget will take effect on July 1.
